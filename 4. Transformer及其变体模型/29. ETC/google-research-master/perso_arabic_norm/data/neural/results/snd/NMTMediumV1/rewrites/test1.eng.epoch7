The Beneficent, the Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Judgment.
We worship Thee, and You ask for help.
Guide us to the straight path.
The path of those whom You have favoured, not of those who have earned Your wrath, nor of those who go astray.
Alif Lam Mim.
This is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guidance for those who fear Allah.
Those who believe in the unseen, and establish prayer and spend out of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, and they are certain of the Hereafter.
These are on guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.
Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a covering, and theirs is a great punishment.
Among men are some who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," but they are not believers.
They deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none but themselves, and they perceive not.
In their hearts is a disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment for their lies.
And when it is said to them: Make not mischief on the earth, they say: We are only peacemakers.
Indeed, they are the corrupters, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them: Believe as the people believe, they say: Shall we believe as the fools believe?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their devils, they say, "Indeed, we are with you; we were only mocking."
Allah will mock them, and they will wander in their rebellion in their rebellion.
These are the ones who have purchased error for guidance, so their transaction has no profit, nor are they guided.
Their likeness is like the likeness of one who kindled a fire, and when it had illumined it, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, so that they cannot see.
Deaf, dumb, blind, and they will not return.
Or like a cloud from the sky, darkness, and lightning, and thunder, and lightning, they thrust their fingers in their ears for fear of death; and Allah encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning almost takes away their eyes, so when it flashes upon them, they stand in it, and when it comes to them, they stand in it; and if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their hearing; surely Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous.
Who has made the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy, and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth fruits for you for your sustenance; then do not set up rivals with Allah; then do not set up rivals with Allah.
And if you are in doubt concerning what We have sent down upon Our servant (Muhammad), then produce a surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do it not, and you will never do it, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, that they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will say, "This is what we were given us before," they will say, "This is what we were given us before," and they will abide therein forever.
Allah is not ashamed of anything but a gnat or a gnat, but those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; and those who disbelieve say, "This is what Allah is about to do." And He guides many of them, and He guides many of them, and He guides many the transgressors.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after its break, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the earth; these are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will give you life, and then to Him you will be returned.
He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He established the heavens and made them seven heavens, and He has knowledge of all things.
And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "I am going to create a vicegerent on earth," they said, "Will you place someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, and we will glorify Your Name and sanctify you?"
And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them the angels and said, "Tell me the names of these, if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." So when they had informed them their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you conceal and what you reveal?"
And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves to Adam", they prostrated themselves except Iblis, he refused to be arrogant, and he became arrogant.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat of it wherever ye will, but approach not the approach of this approach, lest ye be of the unjust.
Then Satan made them slip out of it, and made them go out of it, and said, "Go down into the land," and We said, "Go down into the land," and for a time for a while, and for a while, it is a provision for you.
Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord turned to him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
We said: "Get down all of you all together, and if there comes to you a guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve."
And those who disbelieve and deny Our Signs, they are the companions of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant with Me, I will fulfil My covenant with you, and fear Me.
And believe in what I have sent down with you, confirming that which is with you, and be not the first of those who disbelieve, and do not sell My signs for a small price, and fear Me.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth while you know.
Establish prayer and pay the poor-rate and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin the people with good deeds, and you forget yourselves? When you are the Book, you will not understand.
And seek assistance through patience and prayer, and it is a hard thing except for the humble ones.
Those who know that they will meet their Lord and to Him they will return.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above all nations.
And fear the Day when no soul will avail another soul, nor will any intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when We saved you from Pharaoh's people who were afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women; and in that was a tremendous trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you, and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people while you were looking.
And when We made Moses forty nights, then you took the calf for him, and you were unjust.
Then We pardoned you after that, so that you might be grateful.
And (remember) when We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion (between right and wrong), so that you might be guided aright.
And (remember) when Musa said to his people: "O my people! You have wronged yourselves by Allah, so turn to your Lord in repentance and slay yourselves. That is better for you in your own creation. He has mercy on you. He is the All-forgiving, the Most Merciful.
And [mention] when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah outright, so the thunderbolt seized you while you were looking."
Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful.
And We caused you the shade, and We sent down to you manna and quails, saying: Eat of the good things We have provided you; and they did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves.
And when We said: Enter the city, and eat from it wherever you will, and enter the gate, and say, "Forgive us our sins," and We will forgive you your sins, and We will give you the reward of the righteous.
Then the wrongdoers changed the word of what they had told them, so We sent down upon them a plague from heaven, and We sent down upon them a plague from heaven.
And when Musa prayed for water for his people, We said: Strike your rock with your staff, and then gushed forth from each other; each tribe gushed out of their drinking place; and eat from the sustenance of Allah and do not act on the earth, nor do mischief on earth.
And you said, "O Moses, do not be patient, we will not be patient, so pray for our Lord, the earth, the earth, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, which We have created for us." They will be told, "What is the matter with you?" And they were afflicted with the cause of Allah, and they were afflicted with the cause of Allah. They were in the midst of those who did not believe in Allah and all that they had done. They were in the midst of those who did not believe in Allah, and they were transgressors.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward with their Lord, and no fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve.
And when We took a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember that which is in it, so that you may fear Allah.
Then you turned away after that, and it was not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy.
And you know those of you who transgressed concerning the Sabbath, so We said to them, "Be apes, despised."
So We made it a lesson for the towns and those who lived in the towns, and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
And when Moses said to his people, "Indeed, Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Are you mocking us?" He said, "Indeed, I am of the ignorant."
They said, "Call upon us your Lord to make plain to us what it is." Moses said, "He is a cow, neither a son, nor a young man." So do you have what you were commanded? So do you have what you were commanded?
They said: Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us its colour. He said, "This is a cow," she said, "It is a cow whose colour is white."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us that He may make it clear to us what she is like us. If Allah wills, we will surely be guided."
He said, "It is he who has a cow, he has no ground on the earth, nor does any of the water, nor does he eat any food." They said, "We have come to you." They said, "I have come to you." They will not be able to do anything.
And when you killed a man, and disputed with you, and Allah was with what you were hiding.
So We said: Strike the dead with a part of it, and Allah will bring the dead to life, and He will show you His signs, so that you may understand.
Then, after that, your hearts are hardened, even though they are stones, even though they are rocks, and there are some of them that gush forth from the ground, and there are some of them who are covered with water, and there are some of them who fear Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
“Do you think that you should believe in Him while a group of them heard the word of Allah, then they understood it, and they understood it knowingly?”
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they meet each other with each other, they say, "Do you tell them what Allah has revealed to you, that they may argue with you concerning what Allah has revealed to you?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?
And among them are those who do not know the Book but the Book, and they do not know except what they are doing.
So woe to those who write their hands in the Book, and they will say, "This is from Allah," so that they may take a small price for it; so woe to them for what their hands have earned, and woe to them for what they earn.
And they say: "The Fire will not touch us but for a few numbered days." Say: "Have you taken a covenant from Allah, that Allah will not fail His promise, or do you say about Allah what you do not know?"
Nay, those who do evil and do evil deeds, these are the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
As for those who believe and do good works, they are the dwellers of Paradise, they will abide therein forever.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (saying): "Worship none but Allah, and be dutiful to parents, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and to speak to the people, and to speak the prayer, and to establish the prayer, and to pay the poor-rate."
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you (O Muhammad SAW): “Do not shed your blood, nor will you take your homes out of your homes, and you will be witnesses, and you will be witnesses.”
Then you will be the people of your people, and from his people a group of the wicked, and a group of the wicked, and some of them are one of them, and some of them are in the midst of you, and they will not leave you with what they have eaten with you. And the punishment of the Day of Resurrection will come to you, and you will be in the torment of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
They are the ones who bought the life of this world for the Hereafter, so their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And certainly We gave Moses the Book and followed after him messengers; and We gave Jesus the son of Mary, clear arguments, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit.
And they say: Our hearts are hearts. Nay, but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, even though they believe.
And when they had received the Book from Allah, confirming that which was with them before them, and before the disbelievers had come to them, they refused to disbelieve in it, and when it came to them, they disbelieve in it; then the curse of Allah is upon those who disbelieve.
Evil is that which they have sold in that which Allah has sent down, that they may disbelieve in that which Allah has sent down from among His servants; so they have incurred wrath with wrath, and wrath has afflicted them with wrath; and for the unbelievers is a disgraceful punishment.
And when it is said to them: Believe in what Allah has sent down, they say: We believe in what was sent down to us, and they disbelieve in what was sent down to us.
And indeed Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you worshipped the calf, and you were unjust.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from you and raised the Mount above you, (saying): Hold fast to what We have given you and listen to it, and they said, "We hear and we do not believe," and their hearts took the calf for their disbelief. Say: "What is it that you believe?"
Say: "If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is specially for you and the other people, then wish for death, if you are truthful."
And they will never wish for that which their hands have sent before, and Allah is well aware of the unjust.
And thou wilt find them in the life of the people, and the idolaters are more than the idolaters; each one of them desire a thousand years; and it is not for him to save him from the punishment of the punishment. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (Gabriel), then he is the enemy of Allah to your heart, confirming that which was before it, confirming that which was before it, and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers."
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His Messengers and Gabriel, then surely Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.
We have sent down to you clear signs, and none will deny them except those who disbelieve.
And if they had heard a covenant, a party of them would not believe.
And when a Messenger comes to them from Allah, confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they were unaware.
And those who were in the footsteps of those who had gone down before him were cast down into the devils, and it became Satan, the devil, the devil, the devils, the people of the world, and they were the ones who were in the midst of themselves, and they were not in the presence of the people, and they were in the midst of themselves. And they were not in the presence of those who had been given the truth. And if they had made a lie, they would not be able to destroy them. And if they had made a lie, they would not be able to destroy them.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, it would have been better for them, if they had known.
O you who believe! do not say, “Do not say, ‘Do not say,’ and say, ‘Listen and listen.’ And the unbelievers have a painful punishment.
The People of the Book and the People of the Book will not take any good for you from your Lord. And Allah chooses for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
Do We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, then We bring a better one or similar to it? Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?
Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, and that you have no protector or helper?
Or do you ask your Messenger to question Moses before he had been questioned? He who changeth unbelief for a believer has strayed from the right path.
Many of the People of the Book wish that they would turn away from you after your belief after the truth has become clear to them, even after the truth has become clear to them, and forgive and overlook; for Allah has power over all things.
And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and whatever good you send before you, you will find it with God; surely Allah sees what you do.
They say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." They are their own desires: Say: "Bring your proof if you are truthful."
Nay, but whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is a doer of good, he will have his reward with his Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews say, "The Christians are nothing but the Christians," and the Christians say, "The Jews have nothing to follow," although they recite the Book, but they do not know what they say.
And who is more unjust than he who prevents the mosques of Allah in His name, and strives for them for their ruin? They will not be able to save them except in fear; for them is disgrace in this world and in the Hereafter; for them is a great punishment.
To Allah belong the east and the west; so wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah; surely Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
And they say: Allah has taken a son. Glory be to Him! Glory be to Him, all that is in the heavens and on earth: all are all surrendered to Him.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees a matter, He says to it, "Be," and it is.
And those who do not know say, "Why does Allah not speak to us, or not come to us with a sign?" But those before them said, "Their hearts are like those who were before them. We have indeed explained the signs for people who believe."
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the Fire.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor will the Christians be with you until you follow their creed. Say, "The guidance of Allah is the guidance." And if you follow their desires, then you will have no protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book recite it, as it is written in it; they believe in it, and whoever disbelieves in it, they are the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above the nations.
And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will avail another, nor will compensation be accepted from him, nor will any intercession be taken out from any of them, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when Ibrahim (Abraham) tried his Lord with certain words, and he fulfilled it, and said: "I am going to appoint a place for you (O Muhammad)," he said, "I am going to make a covenant with you."
And when We made the House of the House a place of security and a sanctuary for the people of Abraham, and We established Abraham as a place of worship, and We enjoined Abraham and Ishmael, saying: Purify My House for those who circumambulate it, and those who bow prostrate and prostrate themselves.
And when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this a City of Peace and feed its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said, "I will give him a little more than a little, then I will give him the punishment of the Fire." How dreadful is the destination.
And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, they said, "Our Lord, accept this from us; surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing."
Our Lord, make us submissive to You, and from among our offspring a community, to whom You have taught us our rites, and forgive us our sins; surely Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.
Our Lord! send among them a Messenger from among themselves who will recite unto them Thy Signs and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them; Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.
And he who turns away from the religion of Abraham, except him who is in the world, and We have given him life in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I submit myself to the Lord of the worlds."
And Abraham instructed his sons and Jacob, saying, "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except as Muslims."
Did you (O Muhammad) come to die when death came to his father, when he said to his sons, "What shall you worship after me?" They said, "We will worship your God, your God, the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael, the One God, and to Him we submit."
This is a people that have passed away; for them is what they earned, and for you is what you earn, and you will not be questioned for what you used to do.
They say: "Become Jews or Christians," they would say: "We follow the religion of Abraham," and he was not of the polytheists.
Say, "We believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to us, and that which was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and to the prophets, and to the prophets. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit."
And if they believe in the same as they believe in it, they are indeed on the right path; but if they turn away, they are in schism; and Allah will suffice you against them; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
[28:28] And what is the religion of Allah, and who is better than Allah?
Say, "Do you argue with us concerning Allah while He is our Lord and your Lord?
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: "Do you know better than Allah?" And he is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony from Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
This is a community that have passed away; for them is what they earned, and for you is what you earn, and you will not be questioned for what you did.
The people of the people will say to the people, "What has they received?" Say: "The east and the west have turned away from what they have observed, and Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path."
Thus have We made you a middle nation, that you may be witnesses over the people and the Messenger, and that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that We may know that which is before you. And whoever is guided by the guidance of Allah, it is only for those who believe. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
We see the turning of the heaven to you. We will surely turn you to a qiblah that will turn you back to the Sacred Mosque. So turn your faces towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are, turn your faces to the Sacred Mosque. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.
And if you had all that had been given the Book to them, they would not follow your qiblah, nor will you follow their qiblah, nor are they to follow the qiblah of those who follow it. And if you follow their desires, then follow their desires.
Those to whom We have given the Book know that they recognize their children, but most of them know that they are the truth.
The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.
And for every one is a direction for him, so that he may be in good deeds; wherever you are, Allah will bring you together; surely Allah is Able to do all things.
And when you turn forth, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and it is the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you are, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your faces to the Sacred Mosque, so that you may not have any argument against any other people except those of them who do wrong, so fear them, and I will complete My favor upon you, so that I may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided.
Just as We have sent among you a Messenger from yourselves reciting to you Our verses and purifies you and teaching you the Book and wisdom, and teaching you that which you did not know.
“Therefore remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful to Me.”
O you who believe! Seek help with patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the patient.
“And say not of those who are slain in Allah's way: nay, nay, they are dead, but ye perceive not, but ye are the ones who do not understand.”
And We will surely test you with a test of hunger and hunger, and with wealth and lives, and with fruits, and give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere.
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: "To Allah belong to us, and to Him shall we return."
They are those on whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord, and it is they who are the guided ones.
And Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah; so whoever is the House of Allah, there is no blame on him, and whoever does good, there is no blame on him; and whoever does good, then surely Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.
Those who make clear to them the clear signs, and the guidance which We have revealed to them in the Book, and that Allah will curse those who are cursed and curse them.
Except those who repent and amend and make clear their deeds, and I am the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the curse of Allah and the angels, and all mankind.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
And your God is One God, there is no god but He, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the alternation of the night and the day, and the ships, the sea, the sea, the sea, the sea, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and all that is in the earth. There is a sign in the heavens and the earth; surely there is signs in the heavens and the earth; surely there is signs for people who understand.
And there is one of the people who take other than Allah as equals as they love Allah; and those who believe are in love of Allah, and those who do not believe in Allah's sight, when they see that they see the punishment when they see the punishment, and Allah is severe in punishment.
And when those who were before them will disown those who were before them, and they see the punishment, and they will be among them.
And those who followed will say, "If we had been returned to the life of this world, we would disown them as they were disowned." Thus Allah will show them their deeds in their hearts, and they will not be able to escape from the Fire.
O people, eat from the earth and all that is on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your open enemy.
He only commands you to do evil and evil, and that you say about Allah what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has sent down," they say, "We follow what we found our fathers following," even though their fathers were not aware of what they did, nor were they guided.
The parable of those who disbelieve is like the parable of those who hear nothing but a shout and a call, but they hear no cry but they are blind. They do not understand.
O you who have believed, eat from the good things which We have provided for you, and give thanks to Allah, if it is He that is grateful.
He has forbidden you from death and blood, and the flesh of swine, and what is in the name of other than other than Allah. But whoever is forced by necessity, there is no blame on him, nor is there any blame on him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Verily, those who conceal the Book of Allah, and purchase a small gain for a small price, they will not eat in their bellies, but Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
They are those who have purchased error in error and seek forgiveness for their sins. How can they be impatient?
That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) with the truth, and those who differ in the Book are in a great schism.
You will not call on the east and the west. There is no good for him; whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and believes in Allah and His angels, and the orphans, and the needy, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and those who are near to you, and those who keep their covenant with you, they will be the best of those who are patient. They are the truthful ones.
O you who believe, there is a sign for you in the state of the law, so that you may be a Muslim, and a woman who is a woman who is a woman of old, and a woman who is a slave of his brother, so that he may make it lawful for them. This is a mercy from your Lord, and there is a mercy from your Lord, and a mercy from your Lord.
And in the life of you there is a life of retaliation for you, so that you may fear Allah.
“It is prescribed for you, when death approaches one of you, if he leaves wealth, that he may give a bequest to parents and near relatives.
And whoever changes it after he has heard it, it will be the sin of those who change it; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
And if any person fears or knows that he is a testator, then there is no blame on him; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard (against evil).
The number of a number of the days of you, or some of you are sick, or on a journey, on the day of a day; and the feeding of those who are needy is the feeding of the feeding of a poor person; and whoever does good, it is better for him; but if you know, it is better for you; but if you know, you will be better.
It is in the Qur'an that the Qur'an is that which is revealed to you in the Qur'an that is a guidance to the people who are guided by the Qur'an, and the guidance of the Qur'an is that which is recited to you, and that which is in the hearts of those who have come to the Day of Resurrection, and that it is a good thing for you, and that it is a good thing for you.
And when My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them): I pray to the prayer of those who call on Me, when I will respond to the prayer of those who call on Me, and they will believe in Me, that they may walk in the right way.
This is lawful for you in the night of the night. They are as a garment for you, and you are a garment for them, and you know that you are enemies of your enemies, so that you may have mercy on you, so that you may not be able to forgive them, and then you will be able to do so, so that you may not be able to do so, so that you may not be able to do so. So do not approach them in the way that Allah has given you. So do not approach them in the way of Allah. So do not approach them in the way of Allah. So do not approach them, that they may be cautious.
And do not devour your wealth in justice, nor do He make the judges to make it lawful to the judges, but you will not be able to take the property of the people with a little while.
They ask you about the Qur'an, and say: "These are the people who are appointed for men, and they do not think that they are the people of the houses, but that you should go back to their homes in the houses, and there is no good for them, and fear Allah, so that you may be successful."
Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors.

And when it became clear to him, he said: "I know that which is clear to you." And when it became clear to him, he said, 'I know that Allah is Able to do all things.

Say: "O People of the Scripture (People of the Scripture), come to a word that is equitable and a word that is just between us and you: that we will not worship except except Allah, and not take one another as lords other than Allah."
O People of the Scripture, why do you argue about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not sent down after him? Will you not then understand?
You are the ones who dispute about what you know. Do you dispute about what you have no knowledge? And you know what you do not know. And Allah knows what you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian, but he was a man who was upright, and he was not of the idolaters.
The people of Abraham are those who follow the message of Allah and His Messenger and those who believe in him. Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
A party of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they mislead none but themselves, and they do not perceive.
O People of the Scripture (O People of the Scripture), why do you believe in Allah's signs, and do you bear witness about it?
O People of the Scripture, why do you confound the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?
And some of the People of the Book say: "Believe in the morning (the Qur'an) which has been revealed to the believers, and reject it in the evening, that haply they may turn away."
And do not believe except those who follow your religion. Say, "The guidance of Allah is the guidance of those you have been given to you, or they will not come with you with your Lord. Say: 'In the hand of Allah, He will give it to whom He wills; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.'
He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.
Among the People of the Book there is a party of the People of the Book; if you give a credit to a believer, it will be given to you, and some of them will not give you permission unless you trust it. That is because they say, "There is no blame on us," and they know what they say.
Nay, but whoever fulfils his pledge and fears Allah, then surely Allah loves those who fear Him.
Those who sell the covenant of Allah and their oaths for a small price, they will not have any share in the Hereafter, nor will He speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them; and theirs is a painful punishment.
And among them is a party of the Book with their tongues, that you may think that the Book is in the Book, and it is not from the Book, and they say: This is from Allah; and it is not from Allah, and they know that they are liars.
And no man can be able to say to him, "Allah has given him the Book and wisdom," then he said to the people, "I am quit of my Lord."
Nor does He command you to take the angels and the prophets for your Lord; then if you submit to Him, then will He make you disbelieve?
And (remember) when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets (saying): "I have given you the Book and Hikmah (wisdom) and Hikmah (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), then you will believe in him, and you will help him."
But whoever turns away after that, these are the transgressors.
Are they seeking a religion other than Allah, and whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly, willingly and unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned.
Say, "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and the prophets, and the messengers, and the messengers, and the messengers, and the messengers, and the messengers, and We make no distinction between any of them."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and they had borne witness that the Messenger is true and clear arguments came to them? And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
They are the ones who will be punished with the curse of Allah and the angels and all mankind.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
Except those who repent thereafter and amend and amend; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who disbelieve after their belief and then increase in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted; and they are the ones who are astray.
Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the earth will not be accepted from them, even if they had offered it to ransom, they will not be accepted from it.
By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you give of that which you love; and whatever you do, Allah knows it.
All food is lawful for the children of Israel except that which was forbidden to the Children of Israel, before the Torah had been revealed before it. Say, "Produce your proof, if you are truthful."
Then whoever forges a lie against Allah after that, these are the wrongdoers.
Say, "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the polytheists."
Verily, the first House (of worship) established for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), at Bakkah (Makkah), and a guidance for the worlds.
There are signs in the clear signs of Abraham. And whoever enters it, it is safe for him; and the House of Allah is a place of the pilgrimage. And whoever disbelieves and disbelieves, then surely Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say: "O People of the Scripture (People of the Scripture), why do you disbelieve in the communications of Allah (i.e. the Qur'an), and that Allah is the Witness of what you do?"
Say: "O People of the Scripture (People of the Scripture), who believe in the way of Allah (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel) of the Book) from the Path of Allah (i.e. the Qur'an and the Sunnah), then do you make it crooked, even though you are witnesses?"
O you who believe! if you obey a party of the People of the Book, they will turn you back after your belief.
And how can you disbelieve, when the verses of Allah are recited to you, and His Messenger is in you; and whoever holds fast to Allah, He guides it to a straight path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast to the rope of Allah all together, and do not be divided, and remember Allah's favour upon you, when you were enemies, so that He might strengthen your hearts, and you were on the brink of the pit of the Fire, and you were on the brink of a pit of fire. Thus Allah makes clear His signs to you, so that you may be guided.
And among you is a community who invite to good, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; these are the successful.
And be not like those who became divided and disagreed after clear arguments had come to them, and theirs is a great punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be black black black black black black faces, will it be said to them, "Did you reject your faith after accepting it? Taste the punishment for your disbelief."
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and they shall abide therein forever.
These are the signs of Allah, We recite them to you with truth, and Allah does not desire the unjust.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; and to Allah all things are returned.
You are the best of the people who are the best of the people; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong; and if the Book had believed, it would have been better for them.
They will not harm you except a trifling annoyance, and if they fight against you, they will turn their backs, and they will not be helped.
They will have a curse against Allah and the people, except for the people, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah upon them and upon them. That is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and they killed the prophets. That is because they disobeyed the signs of Allah and disobeyed the prophets. That is because they transgressed.
They are not the same, the People of the Book are among the People of the Book, reciting the signs of Allah in the watches of the night, and prostrating themselves.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten in good works, and they are the righteous ones.
And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it; and Allah knows the pious.
Indeed, those who disbelieve, neither will their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah. Those are the companions of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
The likeness of those who spend the life of this world is as a likeness of the wind, as a harvest of a harvest, a people who have wronged themselves, and destroys it, and Allah does not wrong them, but they are wronged.
O you who believe! Do not take for friends other than your own other than others, but they do not afflict you with harm, but they love distresses distresses distresses distresses distresses distresses distresses themselves. And what their breasts conceal is greater than that, so that you may understand.
You are the ones who love them, and they do not love you, and you believe in the Book, and when they meet you, they say, "We believe"; but when they are with you, they bite their fingers with rage. Say: "Do not kill yourselves; surely Allah knows what is in the breasts."
If good good befalls you, it grieves them, but if evil befalls you, they rejoice at it, and if you are patient, their guile will not harm you, surely Allah encompasses what they do.
(Remember) when you (O Muhammad SAW) went forth from your homes in the morning (i.e. Makkah) at the battle of the believers (i.e. Makkah), and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
When two parties of you were enemies of the two parties, and Allah is their protector, and the believers put their trust in Allah.
And Allah had helped you at Badr when you were weak, so fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers: Is it not enough for you that your Lord should assist you with three thousand angels sent down?
Yes, if you are patient and Godwary, they will suddenly come to you with your Lord, your Lord will assist you with five thousand angels.
And Allah did not send it except as a bearer of glad tidings, and that your hearts may be secure with it, and there is no help except from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.
That He may cut off a remnant of those who disbelieve, or expose them to infamy, so that they may turn back (to evil).
There is no concern for you, whether He relent to them or punishes them, for they are wrongdoers.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that you may prosper.
And fear the Fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Messenger that you may obtain mercy.
“And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.”
Those who spend (in charity) in prosperity and adversity, who restrain anger and pardon men; and Allah loves those who do good.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; and who can forgive sins except Allah? and do not persist in what they have done, while they are in the wrong-doing.
The reward of their Lord is forgiveness and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever.
Many have passed away before you, so travel in the land and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a sign for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
“And do not grieve, nor grieve, and you will be superior if you are believers.”
If a wound has afflicted you, a similar wound has afflicted you, and We have made the people go to pass in the people, and that Allah may know those who believe, and He will bring you to another, and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test the believers, and destroy the disbelievers.
Or do you think that you would enter Paradise while Allah has not fought among you of those who are patient and who are steadfast?
You did indeed wish for death before you met it, and you have seen it with your eyes.
And Muhammad is no more than a Messenger; indeed there is a Messenger before him; then if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? And he who turns back on his heels will not harm Allah in any harm; and Allah will reward the grateful.
And no death can die except by Allah's command, but whoever desires the reward of this world, We will give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him thereof; and We will reward the grateful.
And many of the prophets have fought, and many of them were in the way of Allah; they did not become weak in what befell them in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they abase themselves; and Allah loves the patient.
And they said: "Our Lord! forgive us our sins, and our excesses in our affair, and grant us victory over our feet, and give us victory over the disbelieving people."
So Allah gave them a reward in this world and the hereafter, and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back to your heels, and you will be losers.
But Allah is your protector, and He is the best of helpers.
We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they ascribe to Allah partners for which He has sent down no authority. Their abode is the Fire, and evil is the abode of the unjust.
And indeed Allah promised you the promise of your promise, so that you took a covenant with him, and you had disputed with them, and you disputed about it, and you did not differ in any matter; surely you were among you, and He turned to you in order that He might test you. And He has pardoned you, and He has pardoned you. And Allah is the Lord of the believers.
And when you did not see any one of them, and the Messenger came to you, and the Messenger was calling you to the rear, so He rewarded you with a grief that you might not grieve, nor grieve with what you had earned, and Allah is well aware of what you do.
Then He sends down tranquillity upon you, a group of you, a party of you, and some of you who were sick, and some of them said, "What is the matter with us?" They said, "What is the matter with us?" They said, "What is the matter with us?" Say, "What is the matter with us?" Say, "What is the matter with us?" Say, "What is the matter with us?" Say, "What is the matter with Allah?" Say, "It is not for us." Say, "Had we had been in the breasts of us, they would not have been sent to it." Say, "Had we had been in your homes, they would have been sent to it." And Allah is Cognizant of what is in your hearts. And Allah is Cognizant of what is in your hearts.
Those of you who turned back on the day when the two hosts met them, Satan made them slip into ignorance because of some of them. But Allah has pardoned them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when they were in the land, or in the land, or in the land, or they said: "If they had been with us, they would not have died, nor would they have been killed; so that Allah may make it die in their hearts, and He will give life and die; and Allah will give life to their hearts, and Allah is well seeing of what you do."
If you are killed or die in the cause of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are better than all that they amass.
And if you die or die, you will be gathered to Allah.
So it is from Allah's mercy that you were gentle to them, and if you were harsh and hard-hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from around you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the affair; then when you have decided, put your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, then who can help you after Him?
It is not for a Messenger that he should be guilty of a Messenger, and he who deceives himself will be on the Day of Resurrection, then every soul will be recompensed for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who draws on the wrath of Allah, and his abode is Hell? And wretched is the destination.
They are in ranks with Allah, and Allah is Seeing of what they do.
Allah conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them His Signs, and purifying them, and teaching them the Book and Wisdom, although before that they were in manifest error.
And when a misfortune befell you, you were afflicted with a great punishment, and you said: "What is this?" Say: "This is from your own souls. Allah has power over all things."
And what befell you on the day the two armies met, by the leave of Allah, and that He might know the believers.
And that the hypocrites might know that it was said to them, "Come, fight in the cause of Allah, or defend yourselves." They said, "If we had known the knowledge of us, we would certainly have been with you." They are nearer to the believers in unbelief, they say, "They are not in their hearts." They say, "In their hearts is what is in their hearts, and Allah knows what they conceal."
They are those who said to their brethren, "Had they had been persecuted, they would not have been killed." Say, "If you had been truthful, then you would surely die, if you are truthful."
“And reckon not those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead; nay, they are alive, and they are the sustenance of their Lord.”
They rejoice in what Allah has given them of His Bounty, and they rejoice in what they have not joined with them, and they have no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the Grace of Allah and His Bounty, and Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to the call of Allah and the Messenger after the wound had befallen them, and those of them who do good and guard with fear shall have a great reward.
Those to whom the people said, "The people have gathered against you, so fear them." But it only increased them in faith, and they said, "Sufficient for us."
So they returned with favor from Allah and His Bounty, and no harm came to them, and they followed the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty.
It is Satan who suggests to you the fear of his votaries, so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And let not those grieve thee grieve until they rush into unbelief; surely Allah does not harm any harm in the Hereafter, but that He will not give them a share in the Hereafter, and for them is a great punishment.
Those who purchase disbelief in the religion of Allah will not harm harm, and they will have a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for them; so We grant them respite only that they may increase in sin; and for them is a disgraceful punishment.
Allah will not leave the believers until you are in the state of the good, and Allah will not give you the good news of the unseen, and Allah will surely take you out of the Unseen; so believe in Allah and His Messengers; and if you believe, you will have a great reward.
And do not think that those who are niggardly in what Allah has bestowed on them, think that it is better for them; it is better for them; it is worse for them to be niggardly on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is well aware of what you do.
Allah has heard the saying of those who say: "Allah is poor," and we are rich, and We shall write down what they say, and the prophets will say, 'Taste the torment of the burning,' and We will say, 'Taste the punishment of the burning.'
That is for what your hands have sent before, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.
They say: "Allah has promised us that we should not believe in any Messenger unless he brings us a fire." Say: 'Messengers before me came to you with clear proofs and with what you say, 'Why did you slay them with what you say, if you are truthful?'
But if they deny you, they were messengers before you, who came to them with clear proofs and the Book and the illuminating Book.
Every soul will taste death, and you will not be recompensed except on the Day of Resurrection, but you will be rewarded with the punishment of the Fire and the Garden, and the life of this world is nothing but a trial.
You will surely be tested in your possessions and your souls, and you will certainly hear the most much of those who were given the Book before you and those who were before you. But if you are patient and fear Allah, He is the All-Seer of all things.
And (remember) when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Scripture (i.e. the Qur'an), that He might make the people of the Book (i.e. the Qur'an), and not hide it, but it was not for you to hide it, but they threw it away (with their backs), and they took a small price for it, so that they (the disbelievers) are evil.
“Do not think that those who rejoice in what they rejoice, and love for what they do not have to be praised for what they do not do, but they will not be able to torment them.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah has power over all things.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, there are signs for those who understand.
Those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: "Our Lord, Thou hast not created this in vain; Glory be to Thee, so protect us from the torment of the Fire."
Our Lord! Thou dost admit him to the Fire, and Thou coverest with him, for the unjust shall have no helper.
Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling to faith, so believe in your Lord, and we will believe, our Lord, forgive us our sins, and cause us to die, and make us die with the righteous.
Our Lord, You have promised us what You have promised us through Your Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection; surely you do not fail to fail.
Then their Lord answered to them, "I will not make any mischief among you or the women of you." But some of you are one of some of them, and some of you are those who have gone home, and they will be in my homes, and they will have their homes, and they will be in the Gardens of Eden, and they will be in the Gardens of Eden, and they will be in the Gardens of Eden, and they will be the best of the reward of Allah. And Allah will admit them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and He will admit them to Gardens of Eternity. And Allah is the best of providers.
Do not let the unbelievers deceive you in the land.
This is a brief enjoyment; then their abode is Hell, and an evil resting place.
But for those who fear their Lord, they are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide therein forever, a reward from Allah; and that which is with Allah is better for those who do good.
Among the People of the Book there are those who believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to you, and in what has been revealed to them, and in what has been revealed to them. They do not take a small price for Allah for a small price. Those are their reward with their Lord; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! be patient and excel in patience and remain stationed, and fear Allah that you may prosper.
O mankind, fear your Lord who created you from a single soul and created from it its mate, and from them He created many men and women, and fear Allah in Whom you demand one another. Surely Allah is over you.
And give the orphans their property, and do not exchange the evil of the evil, nor do they strive with their own property; for this is a great sin.
And if you fear that you should not marry the orphans, then marry the women, two of them, two or two, or two, if you fear that you are not one of them, or that you should be one of the least or the needy.
And give the women their dowries as a free gift, but if they are pleased with you, they will give you a portion of it, and you will be given a good thing.
And do not make your property that Allah has made for you a means of livelihood, and provide for you from it a provision, and clothe them with good words, and speak to them a good word.
And give the orphans the orphans until they reach the age of marriage. So if you are with them, give them their wealth, and do not worry for them, and do not worry of them. And whoever is given a good thing, it is for him. And if you give their money to them, you will bear witness against them. And when you give their money to them, you bear witness against them, and Allah is sufficient for taking account.
There is a share for the people of the parents and the near of kin, and a share of what is near to their parents, and a share of what is near to them, or a small share.
And when the relatives and the orphans and the needy are present, give them something of them, and speak to them kindly words.
And let them fear that if they had remained behind behind their children, they would fear their fear, so let them fear Allah, and say, "Indeed, they fear Allah."
Those who devour the property of the orphans with their bellies, they will burn in their bellies, and they will roast in the Fire.
Allah has given you the children of your children. And the women of the two women are the women of the two daughters, and if they are two than the two women, they are two of them, and if he is one of them, he is one of them; and if he is a child, he is one of the people who are near to Allah. And if they are sons, He is the One Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
And (remember) the women (of women) who divorce your wives (of marriage), and if there is no offspring, if a child is a child, then if a child is a child, then if a child is a child, it is lawful for you, and if you have a child, then if there is a child, there is no other than them. If you have a child, then there is a share between them. And if a child is given to them, then there is no blame on them. And if a child comes to them, he is a slave of them. And if you have a child, then there is no blame on them. And if a child or a child, they will be a slave. And Allah is Knowing, Forbearing.
These are the limits of Allah; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein; and that is the great triumph.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will admit him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he will have a disgraceful punishment.
And if any of your women commit illegal sexual intercourse (i.e. the sexual intercourse) of your women, then bear witness for them against you, if they testify, confine them to houses until death overtakes them or Allah guides them for a straight path.
And if any of you commit indecency, then punish them; but if they repent and amend, turn aside from them; surely Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
Allah accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance, and then repent afterwards; for Allah turns to them in repentance; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
The repentance of those who do not do evil are those who do evil deeds until death comes to them, and he says, "Indeed, I repent," nor for those who die while they die. We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit the marriage of women, nor do they give you a part of what you have given them, but you have no authority except that which you have given them. And with them is an honourable act, if you dislike them; and if you dislike them, it may be that God is good.
And if you wish to take a wife, then take a portion of them, and if you have given a portion of it, then do you take it away from it, or do you take it with a manifest trial?
And indeed, how do you take one another, and have taken a covenant from you, and taken a covenant from you?
And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what is past; indeed, it is indecent and hateful, and an evil way.
It is only that which you have received, and what you have given, and what you have given me, and that which you worship other than Allah, and that you may be your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your mothers, and your mothers, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and you are the ones who have passed away.
And there is no other female than the female. And Allah has ordained for you what is in your hands, and you are not lawful for them except for you. And if you do not take a share of your property, you will have a share of your property, and you will have a share of what you have given them. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And those who accuse women of believing women do not bear adultery, from among the women of the women of the believing women; and Allah knows best what is of you, and that you do not know what is in you, and that you should give them a share of their own women, so that they may not marry the marriage of their husbands. And if they are in the wombs of you, they will not marry you in the punishment of Allah. And if you die, they will be in a state of blame. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah wishes to make clear to you (O Muhammad SAW), and to guide you to the path of those before you, and to turn to you (in repentance); and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And Allah desires to turn towards you, but those who follow their religion wish that you should deviate a great deviation.
Allah wishes to lighten your burden, and man was created weak.
O you who believe! Do not devour your property in the property of your property, but do not kill yourselves with mutual consent, and do not kill yourselves. Indeed Allah is Most Merciful, Most Merciful.
And whoever does that in sin and transgression, We shall roast him in the Fire; and that is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden, We will remove from you your sins and admit you into the Gardens of Bliss.
Do not covet what Allah has made some of you excel others. Men will have a share of what they have earned, and the women will have a share of what they have earned. And seek Allah's grace; surely Allah is Knowing of everything.
And We have appointed heirs of all that is near to parents and near relatives, and with those with whom you have sworn agreements, give them their share; surely Allah is witness over all things.
These are the women who have taken a portion of the women that Allah has made some of them excel others; and they spend their wealth in order that they may spend their wealth, and those who do good in the sight of Allah are those who fear Allah and do not fear them; and if they obey you, then do not make them go astray. And if they obey you, they do not go astray; surely Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
And if you fear a breach between them twain, appoint a one from his family, and from his family, and if they desire peace, Allah will bring between them; surely Allah is Knowing, Knowing.
Worship Allah (Alone), and do not associate anything with Him, and to parents, orphans, orphans, the orphans, the needy, the traveller, the traveller, the traveller, the traveller, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer. Indeed, Allah does not love the arrogant.
Those who are niggardly, and enjoin what is right, and hide what Allah has given them of His bounty, and We have prepared for those who disbelieve a humiliating punishment.
And those who spend their wealth in the sight of men, and they do not believe in Allah nor in the Last Day, and whoever takes Satan for a friend, it is an evil companion.
And why should they believe in Allah and the Last Day, and spend out of what Allah has given them? And Allah is well aware of what they do.
Allah does not wrong the least, but if there is a good deed, He doubles it and gives a great reward.
So how will it be when We bring from every nation a witness, and We bring you (O Muhammad) a witness against them?
On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were levelled with them, and they will not be able to hide anything from Allah.
O you who believe! Do not approach the prayer until you come to the prayer, but you know that you are not aware of what you say, but you are not a believer, or if you are sick, or if you are sick, or if you are sick, or do not give water, then you will be able to make a fruit of water, or your hands, and your hands, and your hands. Surely Allah is Pardoning, Forgiving.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, error, and wish to go astray from you?
And Allah knows best your enemies; and Allah is Sufficient as a protector; and Allah is sufficient as a Helper.
And they (the Jews) left their backs in the Taurat (Jews and Christians), and they (the disbelievers) who are in the state of Allah, and all that is in the breasts, and the ignorant, and the ignorant, and they say, "It is better for them." They will say, "It is better for them." They will say, "It is better for them." They will not believe.
O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), what has been revealed to you that We should believe in what is with you, before you turn away from them, and turn them on their backs, or curse the curse of Allah. And the command of Allah is the command of the Sabbath.
Verily, Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, but He forgives anything other than that to whom He wills.
Have you not seen those who say, "It is only that Allah wills to be praised?" But Allah wills, and they will not be wronged.
See how they invent lies against Allah, and that is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture that they used to believe in idols and devils, and say to those who disbelieve, "This is better than the way of the believers."
They are those whom Allah has cursed, and He whom Allah curses, you shall not find for him any helper.
Is there any share in the dominion with them? But they will not be able to do anything with the people.
Or do they envy people who have received the favour of Allah with them, but We have given Abraham the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them a great kingdom.
And among them are some who believe in the Book, and some of them turn away from it, and for him is a fire.
As for those who reject Our communications, We shall make them enter the Fire, so their skins are their skins, so that they may taste the punishment; surely Allah is Mighty, Wise.
As for those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. They shall have therein pure spouses, and We shall admit them to shades, and We shall admit them to shades, and We will admit them to shades, and We will admit them to shades, and We will admit them to shades, and We will admit them to shades, and We will admit them to shades, and We will admit them to shades, and We will admit them to shades, and We will admit them to the shade of gardens.
Verily, Allah commands you that He may give you a covenant (of justice) with your people, and when you judge between people, judge with justice with justice; surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and whoever is among you; then if you dispute about any dispute, refer to Allah and the Last Day, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day, it is better for you.
Have you not seen those who believe in that which has been revealed to you and what has been revealed before you before you? They wish to reject the false deities, while they were ordered to disbelieve in it. Satan desires to lead them astray.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites turn away from you.
How can it be when a disaster befalls them because of what their hands have sent before them, then they come to you swearing by Allah, "We did not desire anything but good and conciliation."
They are those in whose hearts is the knowledge of what is in their hearts; so turn away from them and admonish them, and speak to them what is right with them.
“We did not send any Messenger but that he should be obeyed by Allah's permission, and when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them, and the Messenger would have begged forgiveness for them, they would surely have found Allah, Most Merciful, Most Merciful.”
But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.
And if We had decreed for them, [O Muhammad], you should be killed or expelled from your homes, but if they had done what they had done, they would not have done it, and they would have done what they had done.
And We have given them a great reward from Us.
And We guided them to a straight path.
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, they are those with whom Allah has bestowed His Grace, the prophets, the martyrs, the martyrs, and the righteous, and they are the best ones.
This is from Allah, and Allah is Knowing of it.
O you who believe! Take your precautions, then go forth in a state of war or go forth in the company.
And surely there is one of you who will lag behind, but if a calamity befalls you, he will say, "Indeed, Allah has favored me with the good news that I should not speak with them."
And if a favour from Allah befell you, he would surely say, as if there had been no friendship between you and him, (saying): "If I had been with them, I would have achieved a great success."
So let them who fight in the life of the Hereafter fight in the way of Allah, and whoever fights in the way of Allah, he will surely be killed, or he who fights in the way of Allah, will surely be a great reward.
And why should you not fight in the way of Allah, and for the weak among men, women, and children, who say, "Our Lord, take us out of this town whose inhabitants are oppressors, and appoint for us from Thee a friend and appoint for us from Thee a helper."
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the devil; then Satan is the enemy of Satan; surely Satan is the cunning of Satan.
Have you not seen those who were told to be told to your hands, "Restrain your hands, and pay the poor-rate, and pay the poor-rate?" But when fighting befell them, a party of them fear fear of Allah. They fear more than their Lord. Say, "Our Lord is the only one." Say, "The life of this world is a little." Say, "Our Lord is the best of those who fear." And the Hereafter will not be wronged.
It is you who will die when you are dead, and if you are in towers, they say, "This is from Allah." But if some good befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah." Say, "All things are from Allah." Say, "All things are from Allah." And if they do not understand, they will not be able to understand.
Whatever good befalls you, it is from Allah; and whatever misfortune befalls you, it is from it; and We have sent you as a Messenger, and Allah is sufficient as a witness.
He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah; but whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a guardian over them.
And they say, "Obedience." But when they came away from you, some of them swear by the night by night, and they conceal what they say. And Allah is the best of what they do. So turn away from them and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is sufficient for the worlds.
Do they not ponder about the Qur'an? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found in it many contradiction.
And when they had come to you with a fear of security or fear, they were clear to it; but if they had referred to it to the Messenger, it would surely have been known to them. Were it not for the grace of Allah and His mercy upon you, it would surely have been a few of them, but it was not for the grace of Allah.
So fight in the cause of Allah, for you are not responsible for your duty, and the believers will be nearer to the believers, so that Allah may make the fighting of those who disbelieve; and Allah is Mighty, Severe in punishment.
Whoever intercedes with a good deed will have a share of it, and whoever intercedes with an evil deed will have a share of it; and Allah is over all things.
And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet it with it, or return it; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
Allah is He, there is no god but He, the Day of Resurrection, who will gather you together in the Day of Resurrection, and who is more truthful than Allah?
What is the matter with you that you are two parties in the two parties, and Allah has made their deeds to them because of their deeds, so that He will guide you with a straight path, and He will not find for you a way in the way of Allah?
They wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, so that you should be one of them; so do not take one another as friends until they fight in the way of Allah; but if they turn back, then seize them wherever you find them, and take not from among them any guardian or helper.
Except for those who have come to you (O Muhammad SAW) that you should have a place of security and a covenant with them, or they come to you with fighting or fighting with you. Had Allah willed, He would surely have given you victory over them. Had Allah willed, He would have given you victory over them, and you will not be able to fight with them. Allah does not guide you.
You will find a people who wish to be safe from your homes, and they wish to be saved from their people, so that they may be separated from their homes, and if they do not turn away from you, they will not be able to disobey you. If you do not turn away from them, you will be able to kill them and kill them wherever you find them; and We have given you a clear authority.
And there is no blame on the believers except for those who believe; and whoever believes in Allah, He will take a free place for him who believes, and whoever is given to his family, there is no forgiveness for him. But if there is a party of you who are the people of the people of the believers, there is no blame on them for the believing women. And if there is a party of your people, there is no forgiveness from Allah. And if there is a sign for you, there is no blame on him. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
“And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his reward is Hell, and the curse of Allah is upon him, and the curse of Allah is upon him, and a great punishment has prepared for him.”
O you who believe! When you go forth in the way of Allah, investigate, and say, "You are not a believer," but if you are greeted with the life of this world, you will not say to the worldly life, “You are not a believer.” And Allah has given you a favour, so that Allah may give you the benefit of you; surely Allah is well aware of what you do.
Those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) are not equal, but those who strive with the cause of Allah with their possessions and their lives in the way of Allah, those who strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah; and Allah has promised the reward of those who strive with their possessions, and the reward of those who strive against Allah; and Allah is the best of providers.
Except forgiveness and mercy; and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who are wronging the angels will say to the angels, "What are you going to do?" They will say, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say, "Was not the earth on earth?" And their abode is hell. How wretched is their abode.
For the men and the women, and the children, and the children, and they do not find any way, nor are they guided.
Allah will forgive them for their sins; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah on earth, there is a refuge in the earth, and a refuge from Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is with Allah; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And when you are journeying in the land, there is no blame on you if you shorten the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve may afflict you, surely the unbelievers are your open enemy.
And when they pray, a group of them pray, and they will be with them with them, they will find them with them, and they will be with them. When they stand before them, they will follow the prayer, and they will be a host of them. And if they are invited, they will be in a state of prayer, and if you are afflicted with an affliction, it will be a hard place for you. Indeed, Allah has prepared for those who disbelieve, if you should be a trial, and if you are afflicted with a misfortune, then you will not be able to take it. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers.
When you have finished the prayer, remember Allah and sitting on your sides, and when you are safe, establish prayer; and when you are safe, prayer is the prayer of the believers.
And do not be weak in the pursuit of the enemy; if you are suffering, they are suffering as you are suffering; and you have no hope in the hope of Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
Verily, We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) the Book (the Qur'an) with the truth (i.e. the Qur'an) which has been revealed to you, so that you may judge between mankind, and do not be of the polytheists, nor do the treacherous.
And seek forgiveness from Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And do not be deceived; God does not love those who are treacherous.
They do not hide from men, but they do not hide from Allah, but they do not hide the night by which they do not hide the night, and Allah encompasses what they do.
Verily, you are a people who argue about the life of this world, but who will argue with them against Allah on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be their guardian?
And whoever does evil or wrongs his own soul and afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whoever commits a sin, it is only for him; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And whoever earns a sin or a sin, then then blames it with a burden of burden and a clear sin.
And had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, a party of them would have followed you, and they would not have wronged you, nor will they harm you with any harm; and Allah has sent down to you the Book and wisdom, and He has taught you what you did not know.
There is no good in their secret in secret, except that which is good or righteous or righteous, and whoever does good in the way of Allah, He will give him a great reward; and whoever does good, We shall give him a great reward.
And whoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows other than the believers, We shall turn him to the path he has turned to, and We shall roast him in Hell, an evil refuge.
Verily, Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.
They call upon female than female female female female female female, and they do not call upon any other than Satan.
Allah has cursed him, and he said: I will surely give a portion of your servants.
And I will mislead them, and I will follow them in vain, and I will mislead them, and I will give them the ears of the cattle, and I will make them forget the creation of Allah. And whoever takes a friend instead of Allah, he has a clear loss.
Satan promises them to deceive them, and He desires them to deceive them, and Satan is the only delusion.
Their abode is Hell, and they will not be able to escape from it.
And those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and they will abide in Allah's promise, and it is more true to him who is truer than Allah.
It is not the desires of those who follow your own desires of the Book and the Book. Whoever does evil will be recompensed with it, and none will have any protector or helper besides Allah.
And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, or believes in the Garden, they will enter Paradise, and they will not be wronged.
And who is better in religion than he who submits himself to Allah while he is good and follows the creed of Abraham, the upright?
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; and Allah encompasses all things.
They ask you concerning the women. Say: "Allah has commanded you to make it clear to you, and that which is revealed to you in the Book, and that which is given to you in the Book, that which they do not do what they do not do what they do not do what they do not do what they do, and what you do is right, and Allah knows what you do."
And if a woman fears a woman or desertion away from her husband, there is no blame on them, if they should make reconciliation between them, there is no blame on them; and if you do good, then surely Allah is aware of what you do.
And you will not be able to make a distinction between your wives, so that you may be able to do so, so that you may not incline to one another, but if you do justice, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And if they separate, Allah will enrich each one of His Bounty, and Allah is All-Embracing, All-Wise.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; and We have given you the Book and the Balance, so that you may fear Allah; and if you disbelieve, then whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth is Allah's; and Allah is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; and Allah is sufficient as a guardian.
"O mankind, if Allah wills, He will take you out of your souls, and He will make you one another.
Whosoever desires the reward of this world, with Allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter; and Allah is Hearing, Seeing.
O you who believe! be fair in justice, as witnesses against Allah, though it is as though you are a guardian or a parents, or if any one is poor or poor or poor, Allah will be more Merciful than them. So do not follow the truth, lest you swerve, and if you distort it, then surely Allah is well aware of what you do.
O you who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the Book which He has sent down to His Messenger and the Book which He has sent down before; and whoever disbelieves in Allah and His angels, His Books, His Books, and the Last Day, and the Last Day, and the Last Day, and the Last Day, and the Last Day.
Those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism), then disbelieve, then believe (again), and then disbelieve (in disbelief), and then disbelieve in disbelief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to a straight path.
Inform the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment.
Those who take the unbelievers for friends instead of the believers, do they seek to take care of them? Glory be to Allah, the Most High, the Most Merciful.
Allah has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the signs of Allah, and mocked at them, not sit with them until they entered into some other discourse. Indeed, Allah will gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers together in the fire of Hell. Indeed, Allah will gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers all together.
Those who wait for you (O Muhammad SAW) are waiting for you; but if a victory comes from Allah, they say, "Were we not with you?" But if a portion of those who disbelieve, those who disbelieve will say to those who disbelieve: "We are not with you." But Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah does not guide the unbelievers.
Indeed, the hypocrites are only to deceive Allah, and Allah is the One who takes them away, while they stand up at the time when they stand up, and they do not remember except Allah, and they do not remember Allah.
They are not a people of them, nor are they among them; and whomsoever Allah lets go astray, there is no guide for him.
O you who believe! do not take the unbelievers for friends instead of the believers; do you wish to take a clear proof against Allah?
The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire, and you will find no helper for them.
Except those who repent and do good, and keep fast to Allah, and those who believe in Allah's religion, and those who believe, and Allah will reward the believers.
Why should Allah punish you if you are grateful and believe? And Allah is Ever-Appreciative, All-Knowing.
Allah does not love any evil, except by a good deed, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
If you do good openly or conceal it or pardon it, surely Allah is Pardoning, Powerful.
Those who believe in Allah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His Messengers, and say, "We believe in some and reject others"; and in a way they will find a way.
Such are those who disbelieve, and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them, Allah will give them their reward; and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The People of the Book ask you to bring down to them a Book from heaven; but they said, "Show us Allah's signs," but they said, "Show us Allah's light," so their thunderbolt fell upon them, and they took a calf.
And We raised the Mount above them above their covenant, and We said to them, "Enter the gate," and We said to them, "Do not exceed the Sabbath," and We took a covenant with them.
So their covenant took their covenant in the communications of Allah and in the prophets, and in the prophets unjustly, and their saying, "Our hearts are hearts"; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe.
And because of their disbelief and uttering a lie against Mary.
That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:-

“Allah bears witness that He has sent down to you (O Muhammad) that which He has sent down with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness, and Allah is witness of it.”
Verily, those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah (i.e. Islamic Monotheism), indeed, they have strayed from a far error.
Those who disbelieve and do wrong, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to a straight path.
They will abide in the fire of Hell, and that is easy for Allah.
O mankind! The Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe in him; and if you disbelieve, then surely whoever is in the heavens and the earth is Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
O People of the Book! Do not exceed your religion, and do not say about Allah, the Messiah, the son of Mary, the son of Mary, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah, and His Spirit. So do not say, "This is better for you." And Allah is the One Who is the One Who is the One Who is the One, the All-Seer.
The Messiah, the son of Mary, will not disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor will the angels be proud of Him, and whoever disdains to worship Him, He will gather them all together.
But as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages in full, and He will give them more out of His Bounty, and those who disdain for disdain, will be punished with a painful punishment.
O mankind, there has come to you a conclusive proof from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.
But those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into His mercy, and He will guide them to a straight path.
They ask you about your father. Say, "Allah will not give you the authority of Allah." Say, "Allah will give you the benefit of your father." And if they are killed, he is one of his brother. And if they die, he is one of the two brothers. And if they are killed, they will be one of the two brothers. And if they are one of the two brothers, they will be one of the two brothers. And if they are one of the two brothers, they will be one of the two brothers. And Allah is All-Knower of everything.

And if you die, then surely you will die. But Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
They ask you (O Muhammad SAW): "These are the ones who have been forbidden (in the Oneness of Allah)." Say: "It is lawful for you (O Muhammad SAW), and that it may be lawful for you, and that it may be lawful for you, and that it may be a favour to you, that you may teach what Allah has taught you." Say, "Eat from what you have forbidden for yourselves. Allah is swift in reckoning."
Today you have provided for you a good and pure food; and the Book is lawful for you, and the food of those who were given the Book, and those who were given the Book to those who were given the Book, there is no blame on them, and those who have been given the Book, and those who have been given the Book, are those who do not believe in it; and whoever disbelieves in it, he will be in his own loss; and in the hereafter he will be of the losers.

So because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and We made their hearts hard, and they were part of what they were reminded of, and they were given a portion of what they were reminded of. But you will not find a few of them except a few of them. So forgive them and overlook them; surely Allah loves those who do good.
And We took a covenant with those who say, "We are Christians"; but they forgot a portion of what they were reminded of, so We separated between them and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will inform them of what they did.
O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much that you used to hide in the Book and passing over much.

Surely they have disbelieved who say, "Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary"; they say, "Who is the Messiah, the son of Mary?" Say, "God will destroy those who are the Messiah, the son of Mary, and all that is between them, and all that is between them. He creates what He wills and is all-powerful."
The Jews and the Christians say: "We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones." Say: "Why then does He punish you for your sins?" He forgives whom He will, and He forgives whom He wills, and punishes whom He pleases, and He is the One Who is the One Who is the One, the All-Seer.
O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger, making clear to you the Messengers, lest you should say, "There came not to us any bearer of good news or a warner." There has come to you a bearer of good news and a warner. And Allah has power over all things.

That is why We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a human being as if he kills or kills the earth, as if he had killed all mankind, and whoever saves it, it is as if he had saved the life of all mankind. And indeed, Our Messengers came to them with clear arguments, and after that many of them are transgressors.
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.
Except those who repent before you overpower them. Know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! fear Allah and seek the means of drawing near to Him, and strive in His way that you may prosper.
Verily, those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism), if they were in the earth, and as much as it had been given to others, it will not be accepted from them in the Penalty of the Day of Resurrection, and it will not be accepted from them, for them is a painful punishment.
They will wish to go out of the Fire, but they will not come forth from it; for them is a lasting punishment.
As for the thief, whether male or female, cut off their hands as a recompense for what they have earned. And Allah is Mighty, Wise.
But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and does good deeds, Allah will turn to him in repentance; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do you not know that Allah is the Owner of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills; and Allah is Able to do all things.
O Prophet! Do not grieve to those who disbelieve, because they say to those who disbelieve: "We believe," they say, "We believe," and their hearts do not believe, and they do not have any knowledge of the testimony of the Jews, and they have not come to you with a lie. They are not with you, but they say, "If you are commanded by what you are commanded, it will be only for you." They will say, "If you are commanded by what you are commanded, it will be only for you." And Allah will not take the hearts of those who are their hearts, and they will have a great punishment.
Those who deny the truth are forbidden for you, but if they come to you, judge them between them, or turn away from them, and if you turn away, they will not bring you any harm, but if you judge between them, judge between them with justice; surely Allah loves those who do good.
And what is the matter with you (O Muhammad SAW) that they should judge with you (the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)), the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), then they turn away after Allah (Alone), and they are not believers.
We have sent down the Torah in the Torah, and the light, and the light, and the prophets, and the rabbis, and the Jews, which they were commanded to do with the Book of God, and they were witnesses against them; so fear not men, but fear Me; and fear Me not, for they are unbelievers.
And We decreed for them in the past that a eye and a eye for a eye, and a nose for a nose, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth; it is for him who does not judge. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, those are the unjust.
And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming that which was before him of the Torah, and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, confirming that which was before it of the Torah, and a guidance and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
And the followers of the Book will judge with what Allah has revealed; and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, these are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) the Book (the Qur'an) with the truth (the Qur'an) which is the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), etc.) which has been sent down to you; so judge between what has been revealed to you (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel)), and follow not the desires of what has come to you, and follow not their low desires (of the truth), and follow not their low desires, for Allah has made it a way of a community.
And judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires, and beware of them lest they tempt you away from some of what Allah has revealed to you. But if they turn away, know that Allah will punish them for their sins. And many of mankind are transgressors.
Or do they seek to seek the command of the matter, and who is better in the religion of God?
O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease, hastening towards them, saying, "We fear lest a misfortune should befall us." But when it comes to them, God will turn out to them, and they will be forgiven, and they will be regretful in their hearts.
And those who believe will say, "Are these the ones who swore by Allah by their strongest oaths that they were with you?" They will have their own deeds, and they are losers.
O you who believe! whoever from among you turns away from his religion, then Allah will bring a people who will love him, and they will love Him, the believers, the unbelievers, the unbelievers, they strive hard in the way of Allah. This is Allah's grace, He gives it to whom He wills; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
Your guardian is only Allah, His Apostle, and the believers, and those who keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, while they bow down.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and those who believe, then surely the party of Allah are the predominant.
O you who believe! Do not take for those who have been given the Book (the Qur'an) as a mockery of those who were given the Book (the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel)) and the disbelievers, and those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah), and fear Allah, if you are believers.
And when you call to prayer, they take it as mockery and sport. That is because they are a people who do not understand.
Say: "O People of the Scripture (People of the Scripture), do you resent us except for a reason that we believe in Allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before us and that you are most disobedient?"
Say, "Shall I inform you of something worse than that of Allah? Those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped the devil, these are worse than these, and are more astray."
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe"; but when they disbelieve, they will be in the midst of those who disbelieve, and they will go forth with it, and Allah knows best what they conceal.
And you see many of them competing with sin and sin, and the devouring of what is in the breasts, and what they do, evil indeed is what they do.
Do they not forbid the rabbis and the rabbis with their mouths and the forbid of what they do? Evil indeed is what they do.
The Jews say, "Allah is angry with the poor." They have their hands in the hands of those who have been told that they were cursed. There is no blame on each other in the hands of those who have been given it. And it is from your Lord that He will make them die, and We will make enmity between them on the Day of Resurrection, and We will make between them enmity over the Day of Resurrection. And Allah does not love the unjust.
And if the People of the Scripture had believed and feared Allah, We would certainly have removed from them their sins and admitted them into Gardens of bliss.
And if they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to them from their Lord, they would surely have been nourished from above them and from beneath their feet. Among them is a party of them, and most of them are evil.
O Messenger! deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord; and if you do it not, then you have not conveyed His message, and Allah will protect you from the people; surely Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.
Say, "O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), you are the People of the Book (Jews and Christians), you who do not stand on the ground, until you have the Torah and the Gospel, and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, will surely increase many of them in inordinacy and disbelief.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
Verily, We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We sent to them messengers, but when there came to them a Messenger with what their hearts did not desire, some of them rejected false lies, and some they killed.
And they thought that there is no trial for them, so they became blind and deaf, then Allah turned to them in mercy; yet many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.
Surely they are those who say: "Allah is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary)," while the Messiah said: "O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." That is what Allah has forbidden for those who associate with Him, and His abode is the Fire, and the unjust will be the Fire, and the unjust will be helped.
Those who say, "Allah is the third of them." There is no god except Allah, and there is no god except Him. But if they do not desist, then woe to those who disbelieve.
Why do they not turn back to Allah, and ask forgiveness for him? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger; before him there came a Messenger before him, and his mother ate food with food; they ate food with food, and see how We make the communications clear.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which is neither harm nor profit? And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Say, "O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), do not exceed the limits of the truth beyond the truth, and do not follow the inclinations of a people who have gone astray before, and misled many many who have gone astray, and have strayed from the right path."
Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they disobeyed and transgressed.
They did not forbid one another from what they used to do, but evil was what they did.
You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which their souls have sent before them, that they may abide in Allah's wrath, and in the torment they shall abide.
And had they believed in Allah and the Messenger and what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them as Auliya (protectors, protectors, protectors, protectors, protectors, protectors, etc.) but many of them are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).
You will surely find the people of the Jews and the idolaters in the most hostile to the believers, and you will find the believers in affection for those who say, "We are Christians." That is because they are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are weak and are not arrogant.
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), you will see their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the truth, they say: "Our Lord!
"And why should we not believe in Allah and in the truth that has come to us, that we may not believe in the Lord our Lord?
So Allah rewarded them with what they said, for them is Gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein they shall abide forever.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our Signs, they are the companions of the Fire.
O you who believe! do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress limits; surely Allah does not love the transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has provided for you and what is good, and fear Allah in Whom you are believers.
Allah will not force you to account for the oaths of your oaths, and you will not afflict the women with whom you have sworn, and you will not be able to marry the poor, unless they are the poor.
O you who believe! intoxicants, gambling, and divining arrows are an abomination of Satan's handiwork; so avoid that you may prosper.
Satan wants to make enmity between you and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer; will you not then desist?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), and fear (Allah), but if you turn away, then know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the clear Message.
There is no blame on those who believe and do good deeds, that they may not be able to eat the fruit of what they have eaten, and believe and do righteous deeds, then fear Allah and believe and do good, and do good, and do good, for Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! Allah will surely test you with your hands or your lances, so that He may test you with what is in your hands, so that He may test those who fear Him in secret; then whoever transgresses after that, there is a painful punishment.
O you who believe! Do not be grateful for that which is not for you, and you shall know that whoever kills you, then whoever kills you, then he who is a believer, then a person who is a believer, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, even though they have done their deeds, and Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
It is lawful for you to eat of the sea, and to eat it for you, and for you and to the needy, and to the land you are forbidden, and fear Allah, and fear Allah, to Whom you will be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah in the House, the Sacred House, and the maintenance of the Month and the maintenance of the month, that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth; and that Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is strict in punishment, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger is only to convey the message, and Allah knows what you conceal and what you conceal.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The evil and the bad are not the like of the good, even though the abundance of the Most Beneficent (Allah) may afflict you. So fear Allah, that you may prosper."
O you who believe! Do not ask about any thing that has been made clear to you, if it is to you, you will be afflicted, and if you ask them about the Qur'an, they will be made manifest to you, so Allah will forgive you. And Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
A people before you had asked before you, and they disbelieved in it.
Allah has not ordained any Bahirah, nor a Wasilah, nor a Wasilah, nor a Wasilah, but the unbelievers deny Allah, but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger," they say, "Sufficient for us is what we found our fathers." Even though their fathers did not know what their fathers did not know, nor were they guided.
O you who believe! do not take your own souls; if you are guided, no harm will you have to stray from the way of Allah. To Allah is your return, and He will inform you of what you did.
O you who believe! if death comes to you, they are two parties, so that they may make two parties, but you are one of the other, or you are one of the other, even though you are in the land, then when you have a doubt, then they will swear by Allah, and if you have no doubt, then they will swear by Allah, and they will swear by Allah.
But if they know that they are guilty of sin, two of them will be two of those who are guilty of those who have received the truth; they will swear by Allah, saying, "Our testimony is truer than the testimony of the two testimony, and we do not have the limits, and we are not of the unjust."
That is more likely that they may know the truth, or that they may fear their oaths after their oaths, and fear Allah. And fear Allah and listen. And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
On the day when Allah will gather all the Messengers together, He will say, "What was the response you received?" They will say, "We have no knowledge. You are the Knower of all things."
And when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, "My mother, I have vowed to you the favor of my mother, and I will gather you with the Holy Spirit, and I will give you a place in which you have been given the Book, and you will not be able to say, ‘This is what the Book of God has given you.'
And when I inspired the disciples, "Believe in Me and My Messenger," they said, "We believe."
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, Son of Mary, is your Lord able to send down with us a table spread with food?"
They said: "We wish that we may eat from it and that our hearts may be reassured and know that We have told you the truth, and that you may be witnesses."
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven, that it may be a festival for us and the first of us and the last of us. You are the best of providers."
Allah said: "I will send it down to you (O Muhammad SAW), but whoever amongst you disbelieves in me, I will punish him with a severe torment, and I will not punish anyone with any of the worlds."
And when Allah will say, "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'I have faith in Allah and my mother' He will say, "You are not the truth," and he will say, "I know what is in my hearts. You know what is in my hearts. You know what is in my hearts. You know what is in my hearts. You know what is in your hearts. You are the Knower of all things."
Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say: 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up, Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness over all things.
If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”
Allah will say: "This is a day on which the truthful will profit their truthfulness; theirs shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow, they shall abide therein forever. Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him. That is the great triumph."
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and He has power over all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and the darkness and the light; then the unbelievers are equal to their Lord.
He it is Who created you from a single soul, and then decreed a term for you, and a term with Him; then you doubt.
And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth; He knows what you conceal and what you earn.
Never come to them a sign from their Lord but they turn away from it.
But they denied the truth when it came to them, but there will come to them the news of what they used to mock.
Have they not seen how many a generation We destroyed before them, even though We had established you in the earth, and We had not given you power over the sky, and We made the rivers flow beneath them, and We caused them to grow in the midst of their sins, and We made them a new creation.
And if We sent down to you a Book written in parchment, so they touched it with their hands, those who disbelieved would have said, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not an angel been sent down to him?" And if We had sent down an angel, it would certainly have been decided for it, but they would not be reprieved.
“And if We had made an angel an angel, We would have made him a man, and We would have made them appear in the matter that they would have been confused.”
And indeed, the Messengers before you were mocked, but those who scoffed at them were enveloped by what they mocked.
Say, "Travel through the land and see how was the end of those who denied."
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "He is Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. He will gather you with the Day of Resurrection, on the Day of Resurrection, on which there is no doubt. They will not believe."
To Him belongs all that is in the night and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Say, "Shall I take for myself a protector other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He feeds and gives no benefit. Say: I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit to Allah, and not be of the polytheists."
Say, "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous day."
On the day when it is averted from that day, Allah has mercy on him, and that is the manifest triumph.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, none can remove it except Him; and if He touches you with good, He has power over all things.
He is the Omnipotent, the Wise.
Say: "What is the matter with you?" Say: "I bear witness that Allah is witness of me and you, and I have been revealed to you, and I have been revealed to you, and that I may warn those who have been warned from Allah." Say: "There is no god except Allah," Say: "There is no god except Allah." Say: "There is no god but He." Say: "There is no god but He, and I am of those who associate partners with Him."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their children; those who have lost their souls will not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs? Verily, the wrongdoers will not prosper.
And on the Day when We will gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, "Where are your partners whom you used to claim?"
Then they will have no excuse except that they will say, "By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters."
See how they lie against what they used to fabricate, and what they used to invent.
And among them are those who listen to you, and We have put on their hearts a covering, and deafness in their hearts; but if they see every sign, they will not believe in it until they come to you. When they come to you, those who dispute with you will say: This is nothing but fables of the ancients.
And they prohibit others from it, and they go away from it, but they do not destroy except themselves, and they do not know.
And if you could see when they are exposed to the Fire, they will say, "Oh, would that we could be returned, and not deny the signs of our Lord."
In fact, they had seen what they had concealed before. But if they were returned, they would certainly return to what they were forbidden, and indeed they are liars.
They say, "There is nothing but our life of this world, and we will not be resurrected."
And if you could but see when they are set before their Lord, He will say, "Is this not real?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" Then He will say, "Taste the punishment of what you used to disbelieve."
Those who deny the meeting of Allah are those who deny the meeting with their Lord, when the Hour comes on them suddenly, they will say, "Alas for us! Alas for us that we will bear the burden of what they have earned, and they will bear their burdens on their backs."
And the life of this world is naught but a sport and a diversion; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, so do you not understand?
We know that what they say grieves you with grief, so they do not lie to you, but the wrongdoers deny the signs of Allah.
Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient, and they were patient, and they were patient until Our help came to them. There is none to alter the words of Allah. And there is no mention of the Messengers.
And if their aversion is hard for you, then if you seek a tunnel on the earth, or a ladder in the sky, or a sign to them, so that you may bring them a sign; and if Allah had willed, He would have brought them all together, so do not be of the ignorant.
Those who listen to it will be guided, and the dead will be resurrected, and they will be returned to Him.
And they say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "Indeed, Allah is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
And there is no creature on earth, nor a bird, nor its wings, but they are like communities like you; We have not neglected anything but the Book, then they shall be gathered to their Lord.
And those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb in utter darkness; but Allah guides whom He wills, and guides whom He wills.
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or the Hour, then call upon other than Allah, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but He will call upon you, and He will remove from you a call from that which you call upon Him, and you will forget what you associate with Him.
And certainly We sent messengers before you, so We seized them with distress and affliction that they might humble themselves.
So when Our punishment came to them, why did they not humble themselves, but their hearts were hardened, and Satan made them fair-seeming to what they did.
So when they forgot what they were reminded of, We opened the gates of every one of them, and those who had been given good deeds, We seized them with a sudden punishment, and they were not in despair.
So the people of the evildoers were cut off, and all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed your hearts, who is a god other than Allah, Who could bring you back?"
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you suddenly or openly, will any one be destroyed except the unjust?"
And We have not sent the Messengers except as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, but whoever believes and reforms - there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
And for those who deny Our signs, He will punish them for what they used to do.
Say, "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you: I am an angel, and I follow none but what is revealed to me. Say, "Are the blind and the blind?" Say, "Are the blind like the blind?"
And warn those who fear their Lord with the fear of their Lord, and they will not have any protector or intercessor, that they may fear Allah.
And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His Face, nor do you have any reckoning over them, nor are you answerable for what you are responsible for, so that you may drive them away, and you will be of the unjust.
And thus We have made some of them some of them, that they may say, "Are these the ones whom Allah has favoured among us?" Allah does not know the grateful ones.
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say, "Peace be upon you. Your Lord has mercy upon Himself, so that whoever does evil in ignorance and thereafter repents and reforms, then He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
And thus do We explain the communications (of the Qur'an), so that they may be guided.
Say, "I am forbidden to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah. Say, "I will not follow your religion. I will not follow your religion, and I will not be of the guided."
Say, "I have been clear to you from my Lord, and you deny it; you are not responsible for what you are impatient; it is only the command of Allah. He is the best of the judges."
Say: "If it had been for me that you would have been in the state of your homes, then my would have been settled in the matter between you, and Allah knows best the unjust."
And His is the keys of the unseen, and none knows it except Him, and He knows what is in the land and the sea; and there is no grain but a grain, and there is no grain but a grain of the earth, nor is it in the earth, but it is in a clear Book.
And He it is Who takes your souls by night, and He knows what you do in the day, then He raises you up in it, so that this term may be fulfilled; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you did.
He is the Guardian over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, until when death comes to you, Our messengers will not die, and they will not be able to do anything.
Then they will be returned to Allah with their truth, they will be returned to Him, and He is the swiftest in reckoning.
Say: "Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him humbly and secretly?"
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "It is Allah Who delivers you from it and from every distress, then you associate partners with Him."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "He has power over you from above you or from beneath your feet, or from beneath your feet, or to make you taste one another in sects and to make you taste a taste of mutual violence. See how We explain the communications in detail that they may understand."
And your people deny it, and it is the truth. Say: I am not a guardian over you.
For every time there is a appointed time, and you will know.
And when you see those who dispute about Our signs, turn away from them until they engage in one another; and if Satan touches you, then do not sit in the company of those who do wrong.
And those who guard (against evil) are not accountable for those who guard (against evil), but it is a reminder to them, that they may guard (against evil).
And those who take their religion as a sport and sport, and give them the life of this world, and warn them of the life of this world; but if they do not have any protector, they will not have any protector, nor shall they have any protector, nor shall they have any protector.
Say: "Shall we worship besides Allah that which gives us no profit, nor will He harm us, and then He will have guided us to the right path, even though they turn away from the Shaitan, and that they may turn away from the evil way in the land?" They will call out to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Say: "This is the guidance of Allah, and we have been commanded to obey the Lord of the worlds."
“And keep up prayer, and fear Him, and He will be to you all together.”
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth; and on the day He will say, "Be!" and it will be said to him: "This is the truth," and on the Day when the trumpet will be blown, His will be the kingdom of the unseen; and He is the Wise, the Wise.
When Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols for idols? I will see you and your people in manifest error."
Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who believe.
And when the night saw him, he saw a star, and he said, "This is my Lord." But when it came, he said, "I do not love the truth."
And when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord," but when it set, he said, "Unless my Lord guides me, I will surely be among the people of the people."
And when he saw the sun rising, he said: This is my Lord, this is greater than this; but when it set, he said, "O my people, I am quit of you."
Verily, I have turned my face to Him who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the polytheists, and I am not of the polytheists.
And his people disputed with him, saying, "Do you dispute with me about Allah, when He guided me to the right path? I fear no fear of what you associate with Him. My Lord comprehends all things in knowledge. Will you not remember?"
How should I fear that which you associate with Him, when you fear not that you have associated with Allah what He has sent down to you? But if you know what is better, then the two parties will be better than the two.
Those who believe, and do not believe in their belief, for them are those who are secure and are guided.
And this is Our argument which We gave Abraham to his people. We raise in degrees whomever We please; surely your Lord is Wise, Knowing.
And We gave Abraham Isaac and Jacob, all of them We guided before Noah, and of his progeny, and to David and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses. Thus do We reward the righteous.
And Zakariya (Zachariya), and Yahya (Jesus), and Isa (Jesus), and Elias (Jesus), each one of them was among the righteous.
And Ishmael, Elisha, and Lot, and each one of them We preferred above the nations.
And of their fathers and their offspring, and of their brothers, and We guided them and guided them to a straight path.
That is the guidance of Allah, He guides whom He wills of His servants, and if they associate others with Him, they would have been destroyed.
These are the ones who gave the Book to the Book and the wisdom and the Prophethood; but if they disbelieve in it, We have a people who disbelieve in it.
They are those whom Allah has guided, so follow their guidance; Say: I do not ask any reward for you; this is a reminder for the worlds.
And they did not take the covenant of Allah with him, because they said: "Allah has sent down all that He has sent down to us." Say: "Why did He not send down the Book (of the Qur'an) which He has revealed to you, and the guidance (of the Qur'an)?" And you will not be able to make it clear to the people, and that you may make clear that which you are hiding with. Say: "This is Allah's Book." Say: "It is Allah Who has sent down the Book, and what is in your hearts."
And this is the Book which We have revealed to it, verifying that which is before it, and that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it, and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are their prayers.
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or says, "It has been revealed to me," and he has not been revealed to him, or is not revealed to him; or if you see it, the angels will be placed on their faces, and the angels will be placed on their faces, and the angels will say, "I am the Book of the Book." And if you see it, then the angels will be with you, and you will be the arrogant.
And indeed you have come to Us, as We created you first, and you have left behind your backs, and We have not seen you with your intercessors, and We do not see with your intercessors those whom you asserted that you were partners with those whom you asserted.
It is Allah Who splits the seed and the date-stone, the living, the living, the living from the living. That is Allah, the Creator of the living; so how are you turned away?

His eyes cannot comprehend Him; He comprehends all things; He is the Subtle, the Aware.

And the word of your Lord is true in truth and in justice; none can change His words; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from Allah's way.

And thus We have made the criminals leaders of the criminals, in order that they might plot therein, but they do not plot except except themselves, and they do not know.
And when a sign comes to them, they say, "We will not believe until we have been given the Messengers of Allah." But Allah knows best what is given to His servants, and the punishment of those who have done evil will have a severe punishment from Allah, and a severe punishment will befall them.
And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills to go astray, He makes his breast narrow and constricted as if he were climbing as though he were climbing.
This is the straight path of your Lord. We have explained the signs for a people who remember.

Verily, the promise which you are promised will surely come to you, and you will not escape.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Work according to your deeds, and I am acting on the (right) work; but you will know that the reward of the Hereafter will be the end of the Hereafter; surely the unjust will not prosper."
And they assign to Allah a share of that which He has created for them, and of what He has created, and they say, "This is for Allah," and they say, "This is for Allah." But what they associate with Allah, they will not reach their associates, and what they associate with Allah is what they do.
And indeed, many of the idolaters have made their children fair-seeming to their children, so that they may ruin them and make their religion obscure to them; and if Allah had willed, they would not have done it. So leave them with what they fabricate, and leave them with what they fabricate.
And they say, "We eat the crops and the crops and the crops, except that they may not eat except what they please, and they will say, 'There is forbidden for them the forbidden cattle,' and they do not mention Allah's name, for they are liars.
And they say: "What is in the bellies of the cattle is that which is in the bellies of our males, and for our women is forbidden; but if they die, they shall be in all that is in it. He will punish them for their sins; surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Knowing."

And He it is Who produces the gardens and the trees, and the crops, and the crops, and the crops, and the olive, and the olive, and the leaf, and the stars, and the fruit thereof, and the fruit of the day, and the harvest of the day; and do not be excessive, for Allah loves not the transgressors.

And of the camels and of the camels. Say: "Is this the two males, or the two females, or the two females, or the wombs of the wombs of the two females?" And when Allah spoke to you, you could be more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah. And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, and who is more unjust than he who does not guide the unjust people?
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not find any forbidden in what has been revealed to me (i.e. the Qur'an) which has been revealed to me except that which is forbidden for death, or the blood of swine, or the blood of swine, or the flesh of swine."

And if they deny you, say: "Your Lord is the Owner of Mercy, and His punishment will not be averted from the guilty people."

And this is a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, so follow it and fear that you may receive mercy.
Lest you should say, "The Book was sent down to two communities before us, and we were unaware of what we were unaware of."
Or lest you should say, "If the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have followed it better than they had been guided. There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance from your Lord. Who is more unjust than he who rejects the signs of Allah and turns away from them? We have prepared for those who turn away from Our signs, for the punishment of Our signs."

Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and do not follow any other guardians except Him. Little are the little ones.
And how many a town have We destroyed, so Our punishment came to them in the night or in the evening they were sleeping.
When Our punishment came to them, their cry was only to say, "We were unjust."
Then We will question those to whom the Messengers were sent, and We will surely question the Messengers.
Then We will narrate to them with knowledge, and we were not absent.

And We have established you in the earth and made it for you in the earth; little are you grateful.

He said, "Get away from the heaven, outcast, and whoever will follow you, I will fill Hell with you all together."
"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in Paradise, and eat from wherever ye please; but approach not the approach of this, lest ye be of the unjust."
Then Satan whispered to them that He might test them with what was hidden from them of their shame, and he said, "Your Lord only forbade you this tree, lest you should become angels or become immortal."

And when they commit an indecency, they say: "We found our fathers doing it," and Allah commanded us what is commanded to us; Say: "Verily, Allah does not command indecency.
Say, "My Lord has commanded justice, and that you stand on your faces at every place of worship, and call upon Him in sincere devotion, and you will not be able to worship Him as He created you, so you will return."
He has guided the people, and some of them have deserved error. They have taken the devils as protectors instead of Allah, and they think that they are guided.
O children of Adam, eat your prayer at every time of prayer, and eat and drink, but do not be excessive; surely Allah does not love the transgressors.

Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has only forbidden immoralities (indecencies), the apparent of them, and all that is hidden, and sin, and oppression, and wrong-doing, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority, and that you say concerning Allah what you do not know."
And for every nation is a term appointed; so when their term comes, they will not be able to delay a single hour, nor will they advance.
O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from among you, rehearsing My revelations to you, then whoever practices piety and reforms, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.

He will say: "Our Lord, He has led us astray, so the torment of the Fire will come upon us." He will say: "This is the punishment of each other, but you do not know."
And the first of them will say to the last of them: "You are not arrogant over us, so taste the punishment for what you used to earn."
As for those who reject Our signs and do not turn away from them, the gates of heaven will not be opened, nor will they enter the Garden until the camel comes through the eye of the needle, and thus do We recompense the guilty.
They will have a bed of fire, and coverings above them. Thus do We recompense the unjust.
And as for those who believe and do good works, We do not burden any soul beyond its scope; these are the dwellers of the Garden; they shall abide therein forever.
And We will remove from them what is in their hearts, and rivers flow beneath them, and they will say, "Praise be to Allah, Who has guided us to us. Had Allah not guided us, we would not have been guided in the way of our Lord." And the Messenger of Our Lord has come to the truth, and they will be called to the right place.
And the dwellers of the Garden will call out to the companions of the Fire (saying): "We have indeed found that which our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true?" They will say: "Yes, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers."
Those who bar from the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked, and they are not in the Hereafter.
And there shall be a barrier between them, and the dwellers of the heights will know that they will recognize their marks by their marks, and they will call out to the dwellers of the Garden: "Peace be with you." They will not enter therein, but they will be in a state of peace.
