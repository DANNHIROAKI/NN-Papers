In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
the Beneficent, the Merciful.
The Day of Judgment,
“You alone worship Him, and we do not help.”
Guide us on the straight path.
the path of those whom You have favoured of His grace, and those who have not incurred the anger of anger, nor are the astray of the Right Way.
<unk>
This is the Book about which there is no doubt; there is no doubt about it.
Those who believe in Allah, and perform the prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, and they believe in the Hereafter and in the Hereafter.
They are on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.
As for those who disbelieve, whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and their hearts, and their eyes are veiled, and there is a great punishment for them.
And among mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do not believe in the Last Day.
They deceive Allah and the believers, but they deceive themselves, but they do not understand.
In their hearts is a disease, but Allah has increased them. They have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Do not cause corruption in the earth,” they say, “We are only peacemakers.”
Nay! they are the mischief, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Believe of those who believe," they say: "Shall we believe as fools?" They say: "Shall we believe?" But they do not know.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe." But when they are alone with their devils, they say, "We are with you. We are only mocking."
Allah mocks them, and letteth them wander blindly in their trespasses.
These are they who have purchased error for guidance, so their commerce will not profit them nor they are guided.
Their parable is like one who kindled a fire, and when he illuminated him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, and they cannot see it.
Deaf, dumb, dumb, and they are blind.
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, and the lightning, and lightning, they thrust their fingers in their ears, and they thrust their fingers in their ears. And Allah surrounds the disbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away their sight. But when they walk over them, they walk therein, and when they walk, they stand on it. And if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah has power over all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may fear.
Who has made the earth a bed for you, and the sky a canopy, and He sends down water from the sky, and He brings down water from the sky; then, then, you do not associate anything with Him.
And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it, and call your call to Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do not, then you will not do it, and you will not have the Fire, the fuel of Hell, and the fuel, and the fuel for the unbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, that they shall enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall be provided its fruit, and they will say: This is that which we had been promised before before, and they shall be given the like of it. They shall be made them purified spouses, and they shall abide therein forever.
And Allah is not ashamed of the similitude of a gnat, or a gnat of a gnat. And those who believe that they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And those who disbelieve say, "This is a god which Allah has sealed." But Allah misleads many of them, and He guides them to the Right Path. He does not guide those who turn astray.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption in the land. These are the losers.
How do you disbelieve in Allah, when He gave you life, then He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then then He will cause you to die, and then to Him you shall return.
He it is Who hath created for you all that is in the earth, then He directed them to the heaven, then He made them seven heavens; and He has knowledge of all things.
And recall what time thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am going to create a viceroy on the earth, they said: Wilt ye place that which ye shall cause corruptly, and shed blood and blood, and we shall celebrate Thy praise and sanctify Thee. He said: I know that which ye know not.
He taught Adam the names of all things. He said, "Bring them the names of the angels." He said, "If you are truthful, you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You! We have no knowledge of what You have taught us. You have no knowledge of this. You are the All-knowing, the All-wise."
He said, "O Adam, tell them the names of their names." And when they gave them their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you disclose and what you disclose?
And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam," they prostrated, but they prostrated, but he refused, and he was arrogant and became one of the unbelievers.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat thereof plenteously of what ye please, and do not approach this tree, but do not approach this tree, lest thou art of the wrong-doers.
Then he made them slip away from them, and made them out of the land. We said, "We shall be told to enter you, and you will be one of the enemies."
Then Adam received from his Lord words of words, and He turned towards him; surely He is the Relenting, the Merciful.
We said, "Get down from it, all of you, and if there comes to you a guidance from Me, those who follow My guidance will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they shall be the fellows of the Fire, wherein they will abide forever.
O Children of Israel, remember My favour which I have bestowed upon you, and fulfil My covenant, and fulfil My covenant, and fear Me, and fear Me.
And believe in what has been revealed to you, and do not be the first of those who believe in it, and do not be the first of those who have not rejected it. Do not sell My signs for a paltry price.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood and do not conceal the truth while you know it.
And perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin righteousness to righteousness and forget yourselves while you are read? Do you not understand?
And seek help in patience and prayer, and Allah is ever pleased with those who believe.
who know that they are going to meet their Lord, and to Him they shall be returned.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I have preferred you, and I have preferred you above the nations.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall compensation be accepted from it, nor shall they be helped.
And (remember) when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who were afflicting you with a terrible torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and was a great trial for your Lord.
And (remember) when We parted the sea for you, and We drowned you with the Pharaoh's people, and you were looking on them.
And (remember) when We made Moses forty nights for forty nights, then you took the calf, and you were wrongdoers.
Then We pardoned you, so that you might give thanks.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.
And (remember) when Moses said to his people: "O my people, you have indeed wronged yourselves in the calf. So turn your repentance to your Creator, and kill your brother. That is what you have done to you. He is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah, while you see the thunderbolt, and you were looking away.
Then We gave you life, so that you may be grateful.
And We shaded you with clouds, and We shaded you manna and quails, "Eat of the good things which We have provided you, and do good good things for you." They wronged Us, but they wronged themselves.
And when We said, “Enter this town and eat plentifully of it wherever you wish, and enter the gate bowing humbly, and say: 'We forgive your sins.” We will forgive your trespasses, and We will increase the gooddoers.
But the wrongdoers changed the word of what they had been forbidden. So We made the wrong-doers for them a plague from the sky, so We used to commit the punishment of the sky.
And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said, "Strike your staff with your staff." And when springs gushed forth, he said, “Strike the rock with your staff; and eat of God’s provision, and do not roam the earth.”
And when you said, "O Moses, we have no power to do good, and we shall not be patient.” And pray to our Lord, and do your family, and your family, and your family, and your family, and your mates, and your eating of the pair of your Lord. That is the same for you who do not believe in God, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and those who have exceeded the limits of God, and do not exchange the limits of the prophets. That is because they exceeded the signs of Allah, and they were transgressors.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews and Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous deeds, their reward is with their Lord, and those who believe and do righteous deeds shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you (saying): "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you may fear Him."
Then you turned away after it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy for you, and that you were among the losers.
And indeed you have already among those who are among the Sabbath among you, so We said to them, "Be apes, despised, despised."
And We made it a deterrent for them, and a guidance for them, and a lesson for those who fear Allah.
When Moses said to his people, "God commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Are you mocking us?" He said, "I seek God to be a fool of the ignorant."
They said, "Pray to your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what she has been given to us." He said, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He is a cow, the cow."
They said, "Pray to your Lord for us that He may bring us what she may be." He said, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "It is a yellow cow."
They said, "Pray to your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what you are alike. Now, we are the cow. If God wills, we will surely be victorious."
He said: "He says, "He says, "It is a cow not trained to plow the fields, nor to irrigate the fields." They said, "Now, when you have brought the truth, they have no power to eat it, and they did not have done it."
And when you killed a man, and disputed in it, and Allah knows what you conceal.
So We said, "Strike him with a part of it." Thus is how Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, so that you may understand.
Then, after your hearts, your hearts hardened, as though they are rocks, and there are rocks in which rivers gush forth, and there are many of them which split them, and there is many of them that split them, and there is many of them that fall forth of the fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you think that they will believe in you, when a group of them are made the word of God, they tampered to the Word of God, and they understood it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe." But when they are alone with one another, they say, "What is what Allah has revealed to you." They say, "It is what Allah has revealed to you. Do you not understand?
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose?
And among them are some who follow the Book, but they follow nothing but they follow nothing. They are only conjecturing.
So woe to those who write their record with the Book, and they say, "This is from Allah," so that they may sell it for a small price. Woe to them, for their deeds, for their earnings.
And they say, “The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days.” Say, “Have you made a covenant with God?” And God will not promise His promise, or do you say about God what you do not know?
Indeed, those who do evil deeds and his own deeds will be inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
And those who believe and do good deeds, they are the fellows of Paradise, wherein they will abide forever.
And when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, saying: Serve none but Allah, and do not be good to parents, and to speak to the orphans and to the needy, and to the needy, and to the needy, and speak kindly to mankind, and establish the prayer, and pay the alms, and you turned away from it, and you turned away.
And when We made a covenant with you, saying, "Do not shed your blood, nor yourselves, except your people from your homes. You have brought your homes from your homes, and you bear witness.
And you (O Muhammad SAW) were people who slew you from a group of people, and he made a group among you, and helped the other among you. And if they had come to you, they would not have taken it to you, unless they had come to you with the land, unless they had no power to carry you out of the land. And if they had been given you, they would not take it to you, but the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
They are the ones who bought the life of the Hereafter, so their punishment shall not be lightened, nor shall they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book, and We sent after him a messenger, and We gave him the son of Mary, and We gave him the son of Mary, and supported him with the Holy Spirit. So when there came to you a messenger from that which your souls did not desire, you grew arrogant, but they were arrogant.
And they say: Our hearts are uncircumcised. Nay! Allah hath cursed them for their unbelief. Little are they believers.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming that which is with them, and they were entreating those who disbelieved in Allah, and when there came to them that which they disbelieved, they disbelieved in it. And Allah is the curse of the disbelievers.
Evil is they that which they have sold their souls, that they may not believe in that which Allah has sent down to them, and that Allah may bestow upon them of His grace whom He pleases of His grace, and those who have incurred wrath from wrath from Allah. For the disbelievers there is a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us." But they do not believe in what is revealed to them, and it is the truth that has been revealed to them. Say, "Why do you kill Allah, if you are believers?
Certainly Moses came to you with clear signs, but you took him as a calf, and you were wrongdoers.
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen: We hear, and we said: We hear and we obey. And the hearts of their hearts were on the calf. Say: 'My faith is that which ye have given you, if ye are believers."
Say: "If the Hereafter is in the Hereafter for you, (O Muhammad), for all other than Allah's life, if you are truthful, then give death to death."
And they will never wish for it, for what their hands have forwarded, and Allah knows the wrongdoers.
You will surely find them to be a greediest of those who love others in the life of the life of the world. However, one of them will be more more than a thousand years. He will replace them from a thousand years, but it will not be averted from the punishment. God sees what they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (Gabriel), whoever is an enemy to him, He has revealed it to you in the Qur'an (the Qur'an), confirming what was before it, and a guidance and glad tidings for those who believe."
Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His angels, His angels, His Messengers, His Messengers, Gabriel, and Michael, indeed Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.
And indeed We have sent down to you clear signs, so that they may deny none of the disbelievers.
Is it that they have made a covenant a party of them, so that they are a party of them? But most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah, confirming that which has been revealed to them, a party of those who have been given the Book threw their backs behind their backs, though they know not.
And they followed him, (O Muhammad), that which was in the sacred manner, and the she's (sheep) belonging to him, they were not the ones who disbelieved, and they were plotting by the religion of the people who were engaged, and they were left by their own journey, and they did not travel in the way of Allah. And they did not see any one of them, but they had no power of it. And they have no knowledge over the people who had no knowledge, but they have no power to be seen.
And if they had believed and had been Godwary, they would have been better from Allah, if they only knew.
O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous words, but say words words words and listen, and listen, and listen to the disbelievers.
Not those of the People of the Book and those who do not believe in the Book, nor do they desire to be good to you from your Lord. But Allah chooses from His mercy whom He wills. And Allah is dispenser of bounty.
If We abrogate a verse, We cause it to be forgotten, or We bring it better than a better or similar it. Do you not know? God has power over all things.
Knowest thou not that unto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and that ye have no protector or helper besides Allah?
(Muhammad), do not ask you to ask the Messenger to be questioned before you. Anyone who exchanges faith from God has certainly strayed from the right path.
Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you away from your faith after having become clear to you, after their hearts has become clear to them. So forgive them and forgive them until Allah has commanded His command. God has power over all things.
And perform your prayers and give the poor-rate, and whatever good good for you, it shall be for you; and Allah sees what you do.
And they say, "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or the Christian." They will say, "It is nothing." Say, "Bring your proof if you are truthful."
Nay, but whosoever submits himself to Allah, and is good, his reward is with his Lord, and there shall be no fear upon them, nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews say, “The Christians are not based on a right religion”; and the Christians say, “The Jews are nothing of the Jews.” And they are readers of the Scripture. They say, "God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning which they differ.”
And who is more unjust than he who prevents the mosques of Allah, while the name of Allah is mentioned to them, and strives to ruin them? It is not for them that they should enter them, unless they enter them. For them there is a great punishment.
To Allah belongs the East and the West. Whichever turn you turn away. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
And they say: Allah hath taken a son to Himself. Glory be to Him. He is the All-sufficient, the All-merciful. He is the All-mighty, the All-laudable.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a thing, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.
And those who do not know that they say, "Why does not Allah speak to us or it is not a sign to us?" Likewise, those who were before them said, "These are the stories of those before them." They are their brothers. We have made the signs clear for the people who believe.
Indeed, We have sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) with the truth, and give good tidings to you and warn you, and you will not be among the inmates of Hell.
Nor will the Jews nor the Christians will be satisfied with you, nor will they follow their creed. Say: 'Allah is the guidance of Guidance." And if you follow their desires, you will have no protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book follow it as those who read the truth. They believe in it, and those who do not believe in it.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favour which I have bestowed upon you, and that I have preferred you, and that I have preferred you over the nations.
And fear the Day whereon no soul shall avail a soul, nor shall compensation be accepted from it, nor shall compensation be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And when his Lord tried with him with certain words, he fulfilled them, and said: I am going to make you a leader of the Children of Israel. And he said: Lo! I have chosen from my offspring. He said: The wrong-doers shall not be of the wrong-doers.
And (remember) when We made the House a place of place for the people, and a place of a place of place, and We made a place of prayer for you, and We said, "Purify My House for those who circumambulate Tawaf, and make the House of those who are around you, and those who bow around it, and those who bow down and prostrate themselves."
And (remember) when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city a place of security, and provide its people with fruits, for them believe in God and the Last Day." He said: "I do not believe in him, but I shall grant you a portion of the Fire, and I will soon drive him to the punishment of the Fire. What an evil destination!"
And (remember) when Abraham and Ishmael (Ishmael) and the foundations (Ishmael), (Abraham) said: "Our Lord! Accept us from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower."
Our Lord, make us submissive to Thee and make us submissive to our descendants, to make us submissive to Thee, and to make us our rites, and forgive us and our trespasses. You are the All-forgiving, the Most Merciful.
Our Lord, raise them a Messenger from among them, who will recite to them Your revelations, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them; You are the All-mighty, the All-wise.”
And who is a believer who follows his religion as a fool of his religion. We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him: Surrender! he said: I am the Lord of the Lord of the Worlds.
And Abraham enjoined his parents and Jacob. He said, “O my sons, indeed Allah has chosen your religion, so do not die except the Muslims.”
Have you seen when the man of Jacob, when he said to his sons, he said, "Will you worship me?" They said, "We will worship your God, and your Lord, and Ishaq, and Isaac, and Isaac, and Isaac, God is all-forgiving, all-merciful."
That is a nation who have passed away. They have done what they earned and what you earn, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
And they say, “Be Jews or Christians, or you will be guided.” Say, “We follow the religion of Abraham, inclining to the religion, and he was not one of the polytheists.”
Say: 'We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and Jesus, and what was given to Jesus from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit."
If they believe in you, they are rightly guided. But if they turn away, they are in schism. But if they turn away, they are in schism. God will suffice you of them. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Allah is the baptism of us, and who is better than one who is better than than Allah? And we worship Him alone.
Say: 'Do you argue with us concerning Allah, and He is our Lord, and your Lord is the Lord of us, and for us are your deeds, and for Him we are sincere."
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians. Say: 'Are you better or God?" And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony from God? And who is more unjust than Allah, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
These were a nation who have passed away, and what they have earned shall be repaid for you, and you will be recompensed for what you have earned, and they will not be questioned about what they used to do.
The foolish people will say, "What has turned them away from the qiblah which has come to them?" Say, "The East and the West belong to God. He guides whomever He wills to a straight path."
Thus We have made you a community like yourselves as a witness to you, and the Messenger is witness to you, and We have not made them a qiblah, so that he may warn you to follow the way of his Lord. And those who follow the way of Allah will turn away to him. And those whom Allah has guided, for him is the way of those who believe.
We see you turning away to the face of your Lord, so that We may turn you to the qiblah. So turn away from your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are secure, you will turn your face towards your Lord. Those who have been given the Book will know that it is the truth from their Lord. God is not unaware of what they do.
And if thou wert to bring them a Book, they will not follow your qiblah; nor thou they follow their qiblah, nor will they follow their qiblah. And if they follow the guidance after you, after them follow their desires, Wert to follow their desires. Lo! thou art the wrong-doers.
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. But some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.
And every one has a direction to which he turns. So race to one another in good works. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together. God has power over all things.
Wherever you turn out, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the truth from your Lord. God is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn forth, then turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you are, turn your faces towards yourselves, so that you may turn your faces towards one of them. So do not fear them, but do not fear them. So fear Me, and do not fear them; and I will guide you with My grace, and that you may be guided.
Thus We have sent to you a Messenger from among you, who recite to you Our verses, and purifying you to be purified, and teaching you the Book and wisdom, and teacheth you the Book, and that you do not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and remember Me, and be ungrateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek help with patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the steadfast.
Do not be like those who are slain in the way of Allah. They are alive, but they are alive.
And We shall test you with something of wealth and hunger, and diminution of wealth and lives and fruits, and give good tidings to the patient.
Who, when a misfortune befalls them, they say: "We are Allah, and to Him we shall return."
They are the ones on whom their Lord is mercy and mercy. They are the rightly guided.
Safa, the Safa and the Marwa are of the symbols of Allah. Whoever performs the House of God, there is no sin for them, and whoever performs the House of God, there is no sin in them. And whoever does good, Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance which We have revealed to them, after We have made a Book clear in the Book, in which We have set the curse of Allah and curse them.
Except those who repent, and make amends, and that they may relent to them; and I am the Relenting, the Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die while they are faithless, the curse of Allah, and the angels, and the angels, and all mankind.
They will abide in it, nor shall their punishment be lightened for them.
Your God is One God; there is no god but He; He is the Compassionate, the Merciful.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the ships, and the ships, that they may sail in the midst of Allah. And He sends down water from the sky, which is in the heavens and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the mountains, and the earth, and the winds are in a clear signs.
And there are some men who take besides Allah as guardians besides Him. They love them as they love Allah. And those who believe are in Allah's love. If they see the punishment, they will see the punishment. God is all-powerful and all-merciful.
And when those who followed them, they shall disown them, and they will be seized the punishment, and they shall be gathered with their homes.
And those who were followed, "If only we would return to us, we would disown them." Thus, they have disowned them. God will inform them of what they have done. They will not be brought out from the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is an enemy to you.
He orders you to commit indecency and indecency, and that you do not know about God that which you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say, "No, but we will follow what we found our fathers following." Even though their fathers had no knowledge, nor are they guided?
The parable of those who disbelieve is like a likeness of a man who shouts to one another, but cries to a single cry, but they are dumb, dumb, dumb. They are dumb.
O you who have believed, eat of the good things We have provided you, and give thanks to God, if you worship Him.
He has forbidden you only carrion, the flesh of swine, the flesh of swine, the flesh of swine, the flesh of swine, the flesh of other than other than that which has been invoked of other than Allah. And if any one is forced, there is no sin for him, and that He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Book, and purchase a small price for a small price, they eat nothing in their bellies. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful punishment.
They are the ones who have bought guidance for guidance and forgiveness for the forgiveness of their Lord.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth, and those who differ in the Book are in a wide schism.
On the first side of the angels, the angels and the angels will not find any good good than Him. To Him belongs the Last Day and the Last Day, and the angels, and the angels, and those who believe in Allah and His Messengers, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the traveller, and the traveller, and the traveller, and the traveller, they are the ones who are godfearing.
O you who have faith! It is no blame for you in the case of which you may be able to settle it. It is a sin that he has entrusted to him. The wife of his wife is a woman who is a wife whose wife is a barren woman. The wife of his wife is an open woman. Let him is a test from this people, and whoever transgresses after him, there is a painful punishment.
There is the life of Equality for you (O Muhammad SAW) for mankind (O Muhammad SAW), in order that you may be cautious.
Prescribed to you, when death approaches you, he should bequeath to his parents, and to leave your parents and relatives. That is an obligation for the pious.
Whoever turns away after it has heard it, it is no sin for him. God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
But if one fears the testator or a testator or a sin, then he has decided between them, there is no sin on them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O ye who believe! Fasting hath been prescribed for you as those was prescribed for you, so that ye may be godfearing.
On the days of days, the day of which you are sick, and some of you are sick, and on the day of one another, he will be a means of atonement for him. And whoever does not give a means of a means of means, it is better for him. And whoever does good spontaneously, it is better for him, if you only knew.
It is a guidance in this Book which has been revealed to the people who have guidance in it, and a guidance, and a clear Book.

And when Jesus came to them, he said, "Who will be my helpers to God?" The disciples said, "We are God's helpers. We have believed in God. Bear witness to us, and we are Muslims."
Our Lord! We believe in what we have sent down and we follow the Messenger, so bear us witness of the witnesses.
And they plotted, and Allah planned, and Allah is the Best of planners.
And when Allah said, “O Jesus, I will take you to Myself, and I will take you to Myself and I will take you to Myself, and I will follow those who follow you with the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning what you differed.”
As for those who disbelieve, I shall punish them with a severe punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they shall have no helpers.
And as for those who believe and do good deeds, He will pay them their hires in full; and Allah does not love the unjust.
These are the verses of which We recite to you (O Muhammad SAW), the Verses and the Wise.
And the likeness of Jesus in Allah's name is like the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, and said, "Be," and he was.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.
Then whoever argue with you concerning that which has come unto thee (Muhammad), say, "Come, let us summon our sons, and your sons, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and pray to us, and pray to us, curse the curse of Allah.
This is the true narrative. There is no god but He. And Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
But if they turn away, then Allah knows best the agents of corruption.
Say: 'People of the Book! Come to us and a common term that we worship none but Allah, and we do not associate anything besides Him, nor any one of us, nor any of any other than us. And if they turn away from Him, say, "Bear witness that we are Muslims."
O People of the Book! Why do you argue about Abraham when the Torah and the Gospel follow the Gospel. Will you not then understand?
Do you argue about that which you have no knowledge? You do not argue about you about any knowledge about you. God knows and you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a believer, and he was not one of the idolaters.
Abraham is a man who are among those who follow him, and those who follow him and those who believe in him, and Allah is the Protector of the believers.
Some of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they only lead themselves astray except themselves, but they are not aware.
O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in Allah's revelations while you are witnesses?
O People of the Book! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood, and conceal what you conceal?
And there was a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in that which hath been revealed to those who believe in the day of the night, and disbelieve in the day that they may turn away.
And do not follow those who follow your religion. Say, "The guidance of God is the guidance of guidance." Say, "Do not follow the like of what has been revealed to you?" Say, "The Hand of God is in the hands of those who have been sent before you." Say, "The Hand of Allah is spacious. He grants it to whom He wills. God is All-Embracing and All-knowing."
He selects to His mercy whom He wills. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
Among the People of the Book is he who, if he entrust you with a quintal, he will bring him back to him. Among them there is some of them. If you entrust him with a dinar, he will not bring him back to you. That is because they say, "We have no power to change it." They say, "We have no power to change it."
Nay, but whoever fulfills his covenant and fears Allah, Allah loves those who do good.
Those who sell Allah's covenant and their oaths for a small price, they have no share in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
And there are a group among them who distort the Book with their tongues, that they may think that it is the Book. And they say, "This is from God." And they say, "This is from God." But they know, and they know about Allah, and they know about Allah.
It is not for any mortal to whom Allah has given the Book and wisdom, and prophethood, and prophethood, and he says to mankind, "Be my servants besides God." And he says to them, “My Lord is the Lord of the Book.”
He will not call you to worship the angels and the angels, but you will submit to Him, if you are obedient.
And remember when Allah took a covenant with the Prophets, and that which was with them, that thou mayest be vouchsafed to the Book, and that which is revealed to you, he said, "Come to you, that which is with you, and he will help him." He said, "It is what you are commanded." He said, "I are witness to you, and I am witness to you."
But those who turn away after that, they are the transgressors.
Do they seek a religion other than Allah, and to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned.
Say: 'We believe in Allah and in what is revealed to us, and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that which was given to Moses and the prophets and the Prophets and the Prophets and the Prophets, and we do not differentiate between any of them, and to Him we submit."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, he will not be accepted of it; and he will be in the Hereafter one of the losers.
How will Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief after they have believed, and that the Messenger are true and the Messenger have come to them, and Allah does not guide the unjust.
They are the ones who will be cursed for the curse of Allah, the angels, the angels, and all mankind.
They will abide therein forever, nor shall they be respited.
Except those who repent and amend and reform that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who disbelieve after their belief, after their disbelief, will be accepted of their disbelief. They are the ones who are astray.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are faithless, there shall not be accepted for them as though he had done the earth. They shall have a painful punishment, and they shall have no helpers.
You will not be able to spend until you spend in the way of God, and whatever you spend in love of Allah. God knows best what you do.
All food was lawful for the Children of Israel, except what Israel made unlawful to the Children of Israel. Say, "Bring the Torah, if you are truthful."
Then whoever fabricates lies after Allah, after it is the wrong-doers.
Say: "Allah has spoken the truth. Follow the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists."
Verily the first House of the first House is for the first men, a blessed place for all mankind.
In it are clear signs in which the Station of Abraham is true, and whoever enters him will be secure. Pilgrimage to the House of God, for the House of the House of the House. It is only for the people who can afford the way of God. And whoever disbelieves, Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say, "People of the Book, why do you reject the signs of Allah, and do you do not believe?
Say, "People of the Book, why do you bar those who believe in the way of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, while you are unaware of it? God is not unaware of what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey a group of those who were given the Book, they will turn you back after your faith, and you will turn away to the unbelievers.
How can you disbelieve, when the revelations of Allah are recited to you, and His Messenger, and His Messenger? Whoever holds him to God, he is indeed a straight path.
O you who believe! Fear Allah, and do not die except Him, and do not die except Muslims.
And hold fast to the command of Allah, and be not divided. And remember Allah's favour upon you, and remember Allah's favour upon you. And remember Allah's blessing upon you, and you were enemies to your hearts, and He has given you His favor, and He has delivered you from His grace, and He saved you from His grace, so that you may be guided.
And there is a group among you who invite good to what is good, enjoining what is right and forbid what is right and forbid what is right. These are the successful.
And do not be like those who differed and differed after themselves after clear proofs came to them, and they have a great punishment.
On the day when some faces will be blackened and some faces will be blackened, and the faces of their faces will be blackened, “Did you believed after your faith? Taste the punishment because of what you used to deny.”
And those whose faces are white, they will be in the mercy of Allah, wherein they will abide forever.
These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you in truth. And Allah does not love the wrong-doers.
And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. And to Allah belongs all affairs, and to Him will be returned.
You are the best among the people who are made the people of the same. He forbid what is right and forbid what is wrong. And if you believe in Allah's guidance, it would have been better for them. Some of them are believers, but most of them are transgressors.
They will not harm you for a harm, but if they fight against you, they will turn their backs, and they will not be helped.
They shall be pitched by the rope of Allah, wherever they are found, they shall be pitched by a rope from Allah. They have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they have incurred a wrath of God. That is because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations, and slew the prophets unjustly. That is because they rebelled, and they were transgressors.
They are not alike. Among the People of the Book are some who recite the revelations of God, who recite the signs of the night, and they are obedient.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is right, and vie in good deeds. These are the righteous.
They shall not be grieved in it, nor will they grieve. God knows the pious.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them against Allah. They are the fellows of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
The likeness of those who spend the life of this world is as a likeness of a freezing wind which smites a like of it. They have wronged themselves, but they have wronged themselves. God wronged them not, but they wrong themselves.
O you who believe! Do not take your confidants other than Him. They do not wish to ruin you. They do not wish to ruin you. Hatred has already appeared to them from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is worse. We have indeed made Our signs clear for you, if you understand.
You are those who love them, and they do not love you. They love you in the Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe," but when they are alone, they bite their fingers in their rage. Say, "Die of your rage. Indeed, Allah knows the innermost of the chests.
If good good happens to you, it grieves them; but if evil befalls you, they rejoice in it. But if you are patient, then their guile will not harm you. God comprehends what they do.
And (remember) when you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) at the house of your Lord, the faithful, the faithful, the faithful. God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
When two parties among you were resolved to deceive courage, and Allah is their Protector. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
And Allah has already helped you in Badr, but you were in the state of Badr. So fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
And (remember) when you said to the believers: "Is it not enough for you that your Lord will reinforce you with three thousand angels?"
Yes, if you are patient and cautious, then the enemy will come upon you, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels.
And Allah did not send it as a message for you, and that your hearts may be satisfied. And Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
So that He may cut off a section of those who disbelieve, or turn them away, so that they may turn away.
It is no concern for you whether He will relent to them or punishes them, or punish them from the punishment.
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! Do not devour usury, doubled, and redoubled, and fear Allah, so that you may prosper.
And fear the Fire which is prepared for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Messenger, so that you may receive mercy.
And vie for forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden which is in the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.
Those who spend the wealth of wealth and spend for the cause of God, and those who restrain their anger, and forgive them; and Allah loves the righteous.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah, and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives Allah and do not persist in what they do.
For them is the reward of their Lord, gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. How excellent is the reward of the righteous.
Many societies have passed away before you. So travel in the land and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a guidance for mankind, and a guidance and a guidance for those who fear Allah.
And do not be sad, nor grieve, and do not grieve, if you are believers.
If a wound has befallen you, a similar wound have touched those who have passed away. We are the haps of every nation, so that Allah may test those who believe and make you martyrs. And Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test those who believe and do not die.
Do you think that you will enter Paradise, and not Allah has not yet tested those who strive with you in the cause of Allah and who are steadfast.
And you were longing for death before death, and you have seen it, and you were looking away.
Muhammad is only a Messenger. Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies, or is slain, will you turn on your heels, or if he is slain, you will turn back on your heels. God will not harm any harm of any harm.
No soul can die except by Allah's command; but whoever does the reward of this world, We shall grant him out of it; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall grant him out of it; and We will reward him to the reward of this world, and We will reward the grateful.
How many a prophet have fought by Allah's cause, and they have fought in Allah's cause with them, and they did not cause themselves in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken themselves, nor did they humble themselves. And Allah loves those who are steadfast.
And they had no knowledge that they said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses in our affairs, and make us firm our feet, and make us victory over the unbelievers."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter; and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will turn back losers.
Nay! Allah is your Patron, and He is the Best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve in their hearts with Allah, for which He has not sent down any authority. Their abode is the Fire; and the evil-doers is their abode.
And Allah has promised the promise of your promise, so that they may make them slip in the midst of the matter, and when ye have made the matter to you, you have disputed in courage and disputed in the matter of Allah. And if you have disbelieved, then He has made you some of the good. And if you have disbelieved, He will test you in the life of the world, and He has pardoned you of you, and He has pardoned you of the believers.
And when ye reached a casting of the side of him, and the Messenger, and the Messenger, he raised you as a messenger, and He made you sorrow, so that you may not grieve for what escaped you, and that you may not grieve for what you have done, and Allah is aware of what you do.
Then, He made you a slumber, so that he might be sent up with a test, and there was among them a warner, and they were not afraid of them, and they said, “This is no more than us.” And they said, “We have no knowledge of what you have been doing.” They said, “We have no knowledge of what you have no knowledge.” They say, "We have no power to change it." Say, "It is what you have no knowledge of what is in the breasts of the earth." And Allah knows what is in your hearts. And He knows what is in your hearts.
Those of you who turned back on the Day of Judgment, when the two armies met them, Satan made them slip of account of what they have earned. But Allah has pardoned them. And Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who believe! Do not be like those who disbelieve, when they go forth to their brethren, when they travel in the land, they say, "If we were with us, they would not have been slain." But Allah will cause it to be in their hearts in their hearts, and He gives life to death and death, and Allah is Seeing of what you do.
And if you are killed in the way of Allah or die, and forgiveness from Allah, and mercy is better than the believers.
And if you die or are slain, then surely Allah will be gathered to all you.
So, the grace of Allah has been gracious to them; and if you were to see courage, they would have dispersed their faces. So pardon them and ask them in their affairs. And when you are resolved, then put your trust in them; and when you are resolved, put your trust in God. Indeed Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, then can you help Him, after Him can help you? And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
It is not for a prophet to defraud dishonestly. Whoever acts dishonestly will receive the Day of Resurrection on which he will come on the Day of Resurrection. Every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like one who is laden from the wrath of Allah, whose refuge is Hell, and whose abode is Hell, and wretched is the destination.
They are in ranks with Allah, and Allah sees what they do.
Allah has favoured the believers when He raised among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses, reciting to them His verses, and purifies them, and teaching them the Book and wisdom, and they were in manifest error.
What, when you were averse to a misfortune, you would have been struck with it as though you were given to say. Say, "What is this?" Say, "It is from your own selves. God has power over all things."
And what befell you on the day of the two armies, the command of Allah, and that He might test the believers.
And that He may know the hypocrites, and it was said to them: "Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves." They said: "If we had been fighting, we would surely have followed you." They were nearer to nearer nearer to disbelief than nearer to their mouths. They say with their mouths with their mouths. And Allah knows what they conceal.
They are the ones who said to their brethren, "Had they obeyed us, they would not have been slain." Say, "If you are truthful, then, you are truthful.
Do not like those who are slain in the way of Allah. They are alive. They are alive from their Lord.
Those who rejoice in that which Allah has given them, and those who are behind with them -- they rejoice in what they have not joined them, and they have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in Allah and His grace, and that Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who answered the call of Allah, and the Messenger, and the Messenger, and those who have done them, will have a great reward.
Those to whom the people said: "Surely, there is no army on you, so fear them against them." But it is increased them, and they said: "Allah is Sufficient for us." And they said: "Allah is Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs."
So they returned with Allah and His grace, and there came to them no evil, but they followed Allah's pleasure; and Allah is mighty in bounty.
It is only Satan who frightens you from his friends. Do not fear them, if you are believers.
And do not grieve for those who disbelieve in the cause of Allah. They will not be able to harm God in the least. God will not cause them in any way in the Hereafter. For them there will be a great punishment.
Those who disbelieve in the way of Allah, they shall not harm Allah, nor will they be a painful punishment.
And not not the disbelievers grieve them, but We shall grant them respite for a good; but We only grant them respite in their sin, and they shall have a humiliating punishment.
It is not for Allah to take the believers, until He may make those who believe in the good. And Allah does not love the evil of the good. And Allah chooses the Unseen, and He chooses His messengers. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and if you believe, there shall have a great reward.
And let not those who do not spend what Allah has given them out of His bounty. It is good for them. It is what they have done for them, but they shall be encircled on the necks of the Day of Resurrection. To God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is aware of what you do.
Allah has heard the saying of those who say: "Allah is poor, and we are rich." We shall write down what they have said, and they said, "Taste the Prophets and their Prophets, and We shall be the torment of the Fire."
That is because of what your hands have forwarded, and Allah is not unjust to His servants.
The Jews say, "We have a promise of God, until we do not bring any Messenger unless he brings us a fire." Say, "My Messengers have come to you with clear proofs." Say, "My Messengers came to you with clear proofs, and what you say, then you are truthful?
But if they reject you, (O Muhammad], those who have denied before you (Muhammad) messengers, who came to them with clear proofs and scriptures, and the enlightening Book.
Every soul shall taste death, and you will be recompensed on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever is removed from the Fire, he will be admitted to the Fire, and he will enter Paradise. The life of this world is nothing but the enjoyment of delusion.
You will surely be tried in your wealth and your lives, and those who have been given the Book before you, and those who have been given the Book before you, and if you are patient, and fear of God. That is the great matter.
And (remember) when Allah made a covenant with the People of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)], the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)]. And they will not conceal it, but they threw their backs behind their backs, and it is a small price for a small price.
Do not suppose that those who rejoice in what they have done, and do not be praised for what they have not done, and do not think that they do not expect them. They will have a painful punishment.
And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah has power over all things.
Surely there is signs in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day, in which there are signs for a people who understand.
Those who remember Allah standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, and say: "Our Lord! You have not created this things. Glory to us from the punishment of the Fire.
Our Lord! You have brought us into the Fire, and Thou hast disgraced in the Fire; and the unjust shall have no helpers.
Our Lord! We have heard a crier calling to him, saying: Believe in your Lord, and believe in us. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and make us die from the righteous.
Our Lord! Grant us the promised of what Thou hast promised us, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Thou breakest not the tryst.
And his Lord says to his Lord, "I am not a child from you, or a female or a female, except one of whom you have been expelled. And if they were expelled from their homes, I shall surely have removed them from their homes, and I shall admit them from the gardens of which rivers flow, and he will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the reward of God.
Do not be impressed in the activities of the unbelievers. Do not be impressed in the unbelievers.
This is a brief enjoyment; then their abode is Hell, and wretched is the destination.
But those who fear their Lord, for them will be gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of Allah, and with Him is the best.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to them, and they humble themselves before Allah, and barter not a small price for a small price; these are their reward with their Lord; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! Be steadfast, and be steadfast, and be steadfast, and fear Allah, that you may prosper.
O mankind! Fear your Lord, Who has created you from a single soul, and He created it from its mate, and He has created them from many men, and from them many men, and women. Fear Allah, and take your duty to Him. Verily Allah is over you a trustee.
And give the orphans their property, and do not exchange the good. And do not consume your property with your property. Indeed, it is a great sin.
And if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly to the orphans, and the orphans, and the women of marriage, or four of them are three or three. If you do not do, you will not be able to treat them, or be nearer to your own hands. That is nearer to you.
And give the women their dowries, handing their dower. If you desire to do good with them, consume it with wholesome appetite, and eat it with wholesome appetite.
And do not give your wealth as your property for you, as He has made for you a means of livelihood for you, and clothe them and clothe them, and speak to them words of words.
And give the orphans the orphans until they reach the age of marriage. If you are able to find them, give them their property, and do not consume their wealth. And do not consume the property of your own soul, and do not spend for it. And if you give them to their own accord, then take it to their own accord. And if you give them to their own accord, you will be witnesses to them. God is Sufficient over all things.
For men is a share for what parents and women, and what is in their parents, a share of their parents, a share for them, or a share, or a share, or a share.
And when one of the orphans and the orphans, and the needy, and the needy, provide them to account of them, and speak kindly to them.
And let them fear of those who fear their parents, if they should leave their children, then fear them, and fear Allah, and speak on them words.
And those who devour the property of the orphans unjustly in their bellies of their bellies, and they shall be in the Fire.
Allah has promised you to marry your parents, and He has given the women daughters of their mothers. If two of you are two women, they have a share of what they have given them. And if you are a child, he will have a share of a man who have given birth to his parents. And if he is a child, he will have a share of a man who have no need of his parents. He is the All-knowing, the All-wise.
And (as for) those who have made your wives for you a certain number of their mothers, there is no more for them if they had found a period of marriage, if they had found a marriage, if they had found it, he would have given him a portion of what they have provided him. And if you have a right child, he would have taken a part of those who have taken on it, and that he may be a child for him. And if you are a child, he will have taken for him a child, and that which is in the wombs of the two-seed. And if any one or a child, he shall have taken it for him, and that he may be a child. And Allah is Knowing, Forbearing.
These are the limits of Allah. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, he will admit him to the Fire, wherein they will abide forever; and a humiliating punishment awaits them.
And if any of your women who commit fornication, then take four witnesses against them, and if they bear witness, confine them their houses until they lay their houses until death takes them, or Allah guides them to a way.
And those among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, then if they repent, then turn them away, then leave them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Only God only accepts repentance for those who do not repent in ignorance, and turns to ignorance in ignorance. God will relent to them. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
There is no blame on those who do not fear their evil deeds. When death approaches them, he says, "I repent, and I repent." And they have prepared a painful punishment.
O you who believe! It is not for you to inherit women for their own oaths, nor do they desire their own souls, lest you may take a part of what they have given you, so that you may take a part of them, unless they are guilty. And if you dislike them, it is not a thing that you dislike, but if you dislike them, you dislike it.
And if you desire to replace a wife with one another, and you have given a part of a dower of gold, then you do not take it, unless you do not take it, unless you do not take it away?
How can you take it to one another, and they have taken a covenant from you, and they have a solemn covenant?
And do not marry women whom your fathers married, except that which is past; this is an evil thing; this is an indecency and an evil way.
You are your enemies in your affairs and your children, and all of them, and in all things, and that you may be your mothers, and your wife, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and the women of your mothers, the marriage of your mothers, and the marriage of your mothers is that they are the marriage of your mothers; and if you are compelled, you shall have no sin. Indeed Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And the women and the women of your women are not lawful. It is not lawful for them that Allah has made lawful to you what is lawful for you, except that you may not take to them, unless you do not take your wealth, unless you should not be able to do a few for them. You have appointed a marriage for you except a few while you should not be blamed. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
And marry not the women and the women who are near to you, and the women of the women of the women of whom the women are not with you. And if Allah has given you the Book, the wealthy of them are not in the right of those who are given you. And when ye come to you, then give them their wives, and give them not of their marriage. And if ye are admonished, then there is no expiation for you. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah wants to explain to you, and those who have been revealed to you (O Muhammad SAW) and those who have been revealed to you (O Muhammad SAW), and to turn to you (mercifully). And Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And Allah will relent to you (O Muhammad SAW) to the Mercy (i.e. to follow the Mercy of Allah). And those who follow their lusts follow their own lusts, they are far away from it.
Allah wishes to lighten your souls, and He is the man of old man.
O you who believe! Do not devour the property of your property except a means of trade, except for the trade of mutual consent, and do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is ever merciful to you.
And whoever does evil deeds, We shall admit him into the Fire, and We shall admit him into the Fire. That is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden, We shall remit your evil deeds and admit you to a noble entrance.
Do not covet what Allah has given some of you to excel others of which He has given some of you. They have a share for what they have earned, and what they have earned for what they have earned. And ask Allah of His bounty. God has knowledge of all things.
We have made heirs for every heirs to what parents and his parents shall be made heirs to you, and those who have made their covenant their share. God is Witness over all things.
Men are the friends of the women of whom Allah has preferred some of them excel others. They spend their wealth for their wealth, and those who fear their wealth. These are the pious ones, and those who fear the duty of God, and beware of them. But if you obey them, they will not be able to change them. God is All-mighty, All-laudable.

If they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spent of God what He has given them out of what they have spent, and Allah knows best what they do.
Allah does not wrong the weight of a atom's weight. If any good deed, He doubles it, and gives him a great reward.

Look, how they invent lies against Allah. This is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who have been given a portion of a Book, saying to the People of the Book, "They are invited to idols, and those who disbelieve, who are better than the believers."
They are the ones whom Allah has cursed. Whomever Allah curses, you will have no helper.
Or do they have a share of a kingdom? Then, they were a people who do not have any power to do even.
Or do they envy that which Allah has bestowed upon them of His grace? We have given the descendants of Abraham, the Book, and the Book, and We gave them a great kingdom.
And among them are those who believe in it, and among them are some who have turned away from it; and We have prepared Hell a Blaze.
As for those who reject Our revelations, We shall scorch them into the Fire. We shall be removed from their skins. We shall replace them to taste the punishment. God is All-mighty, All-wise.

Have you not seen those who believe that they believe in what has been revealed to you, and what has been revealed to you before you, and they have been commanded to be judged to them, though they have not been commanded in them. And Satan desires to lead them far astray.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites turn away from you,
How could it be, when the misfortune befalls them, when their hands have forwarded? Then they will swear to you swearing, swearing, "We have no power to intercede to us, except what they had been doing.

Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Allah. Fight the friends of Satan. Indeed, the stratagems of Satan is weak.
Have you not seen those who were concerned to their parents, and pray to the cause of God, and pay the alms, and the alms, when it was a danger of them, when a time of them were mentioned, they say, “Our Lord, why, when a danger befell them, then a danger of them, then a danger of them?” They say, “Our Lord!” And when you are unjust, they say, “Our life is nothing but the Hereafter.” And they will not be wronged, except the husk of a date-stone.

Whatever good happens to you, from what is from it, and what is from you, it is from your own souls; and We have sent you as a Messenger, and Allah suffices as a witness.
Whoever obeys the Messenger, he has indeed obeyed him. And whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a guardian over them.
They say, "We are Christians." But when they go away from them, they say to them by what they conspire by night. But Allah records what they conspire by night. So turn away from them, and put your trust in Allah. God suffices as a Guardian.
Do they not ponder for the Qur'an? If it had been other than Allah, they would have been found in it.
And when there comes to them a news of safety or security, they know it, and if they have referred it to the Messenger, they would surely believe in it.

They wish that you should disbelieve, as if they are faithless. So do not befriend them. Do not befriend them for them, for they emigrate in the way of Allah. If they turn away, seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not find a guardian or helper of them.
Except those who have been a treaty among you, and those who have gone with you a treaty, or to fight against you in their hearts, unless they fight in their homes, and if Allah had willed, He would have given them power over them, and they have fought over you, then they have fought over you, and they have fought against you, then they have fought against you, and they have not fought with you, and Allah does not guide them.
There is no blame for you that you call out from Paradise, and from their people, and when they are secure, they plunge in it. So if they turn away from you, they plunge in it, nor offer peace with you, and kill them with their hands, and kill them wherever you find them, and kill them wherever you find them.
And the believers shall not find a believer except for the believers, except for the believers, the faithful, the faithful, the faithful, the faithful, the faithful, the one of the faithful. If you are in the way of your Lord, He will have placed for them a single religion. But if you are in your enemies, then the believers will have been appointed for the believers. But if you fear the people of your Lord, then there is a matter between them. And if Allah turns to the people, there is a hard matter for them. And Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his punishment shall be Hell, and he will abide therein forever; and Allah has cursed him and curse him, and has prepared a great punishment for him.
O you who believe! When you are journeying in the way of Allah, investigate, and do not say, "Do not speak to one another." Do not say, "You are not believers." But the life of the life of this world is not possible. But Allah has been gracious to you, but Allah has given you His favor. Indeed, Allah is aware of what you do.
Not equal are those who fight in the believers, except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard in the way of Allah with their possessions and their persons. They are not equal with their wealth with their possessions and their persons. God has preferred all that He has given them. He has preferred the strivers to those who do not believe.
Ranks from Him, and mercy, and mercy. God is Forgiving, Merciful.
And those who have wronged their souls, the angels say to the angels: "Are you the power of you?" They will say: "We are not in the land."

Except those who possess men and women, and children, and children, and they will find no way from it.
That Allah will forgive them. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.
Whoever migrates in the way of Allah, there will find a refuge of the earth, and whoever goes on the earth, and his wealth is vast, and Allah's cause is the believer; and whoever comes to the cause of Allah, it is sufficient for him; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

Those who wait at you, if you are at a victory, they say, “We will not have you with us.” And if the unbelievers are bent to the unbelievers, they say, “Did we not fight with you, we would not have been able to do you not we do not believe?” God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection, and God will not guide the unbelievers.

(Allah) said: "It is said for them for forty years. They will wander in the earth as they wander in the earth. So do not grieve for the transgressing people."
And recite to them the story of two of the two sons of Adam, when they offered the sacrifice of sacrifice, and he had not accepted the one of the other, and he was not accepted of the other. He said: I am going to kill you, and Allah is the Best of those who fear.
"If you stretch your hand to kill me, I will not stretch your hand to kill you. I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds."
Indeed, I desire that you should be tried with my sin and your sin, and you will be among the inmates of hell; and this is the recompense of the wrongdoers.”
So his soul prompted him to kill him, and he killed him, and he became one of the losers.
Then Allah brought a raven scratching to the ground, so that he might show him to the corpse of the naked corpse of his brother. He said, "Woe to me! Am I wish that I could not be able to be able to be a raven raven?"
For the Children of Israel that We have decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul or the corruption of corruption in the earth, it shall be as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as done. Our messengers came to them with clear proofs, but most of them were transgressors.
Those who strive against Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah, they shall be crucified or crucified, or cut off their hands and their feet, or their feet, or their feet. Such is the degradation in this world, and in the Hereafter there is a great punishment.
Except those who repent before you apprehend them. And know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! Fear Allah, and seek a means of means for Him, and strive in His way.
Indeed, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and that it had been offered to them, the ransom of the Day of Resurrection would not be accepted from them, nor will they be a painful punishment.
They will get out from the Fire, and they will not be able to get it. Theirs will be a lasting punishment.
As for the thief, the thief, and the captives, their hands shall be rewarded for them. God is All-mighty, All-wise.
But whoever repents after his own deeds and reforms righteousness, then Allah will relent toward him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Knowest thou not that unto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He forgiveth whom He pleases, and He forgiveth whom He pleases; and Allah has power over all things.
O Prophet, you will not be grieved because of those who are bent to denying their faith because they are averse to their mouths, and they say, "We believe in their hearts." And they are not aware of the hypocrites, but they are in doubt about it. They say, "If you are given the same, you will not be able to do it." But some of those who do not believe in the way of God. They are the ones who have no knowledge of God. They will have a great punishment.
They are avid listeners to falsehood, devourers of the unlawful. If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they will not harm you in the least. But if you judge, judge between them with justice. God loves the equitable.
And what is the matter with you, when they are in doubt about that which is revealed to them, and that which is revealed to them, then turn away after them? And they are not believers.
We have sent down the Book, a guidance, and the light, and the Christians, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the rabbis, and the rabbis (Jews), the rabbis (Jews), the priests of Allah, and the rabbis (Jews), the rabbis (Torah), the Injeel (Jews) of Allah (i.e. the Jews), and the Jews (i.e. the Jews), and the Jews (i.e. the Jews). So do not fear them, but do not make a small price for a small price. And do not make a few for them, except those who disbelieve.
And We have prescribed for them in this life: a life for an eye, an eye for an eye, a nose for an eye, a nose for a nose, a tooth for a tooth, a tooth for a tooth, a tooth for a tooth; and whoever forgoes it, it is a atonement for it. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed to him, they are the wrongdoers.
And We sent to them the son of Mary, son of Mary, confirming what was before him, and We gave him the Gospel, the Gospel, a guidance, and the light, and the confirmation of what was before him, and a guidance, and a guidance for those who fear.
And those who believe in that which Allah hath revealed, and judge in what Allah has revealed. And those who do not judge in what Allah has revealed, they are the transgressors.
He has sent down to you the Book, the Book, the Book, the Book. And We have appointed for them the Book and the truth, so that they may follow their desires. And do not follow their desires, nor follow their desires. And if Allah had willed, He could have made you a community, and they do not follow their desires. And if Allah had willed, He could have made you some nation, and He has given you all of what you differed.
And judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires; and beware of them lest they tempt you out of that which Allah has revealed to you. And if they turn away, then know that Allah will afflict them for some of their sins; and if they turn away, then know that Allah will punish them for their sins; and most of mankind are transgressors.
Do they seek the judgement of the Law of ignorance? And who is more better than God who is better than a certain religion?
O you who believe! Do not befriend the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are allies of one another. And whoever takes you to allies of them, he will be of them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
You will see those in whose hearts is a disease. They say, "We fear lest we may be afraid from us." They say, "We fear lest a misfortune may be struck us, or Allah will bring a victory from Himself and His angels, and they will be regretful in their breasts."
And those who believe will say: "Are these the ones who swore by Allah that they are with you?" They will have their deeds, but they will be lost.
O you who believe! If any of you turn away from his religion, then Allah will guide those who love Him, and He loves those who love Him, and those who believe in the way of Allah, and do not fear in the way of Allah. That is the grace of Allah. He grants His favors to whomever He wills. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
Only those who believe, and Allah and His Messenger, and those who believe, and those who pray regularly, pay the zakat, and bow down.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and His Messenger, then Allah is the party of the victorious.
O you who believe! Do not take yourselves as those who have been given the Book before you, and play, and play, the disbelievers, and the disbelievers. Do not take the unbelievers, if you are believers.
And when you call to prayer, they say, "We are a sport." That is because they are a people who understand not.
Say: 'People of the Book! Do you resent us in any way, except that we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was revealed to us and that which was sent down to us, and most of you are transgressors."
Say, "Shall I inform you about one who is worse than God? They are the ones whom God has cursed, and those whom He has made angry, and those who were disdainful of swine and swine, and swine, and swine. They are the worst ones, and they are further astray from the right path.”
When they come to you, they say, "We believe, and they believe in it, and they are in doubt with it. God knows what they conceal.
You see many of them competing with sin and transgression, and devour illicit things. Evil is what they do.
Why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid them and their consuming them and consuming illicit things? Evil is what they do.
And the Jews say, "Allah is the fourth, and the sick." They said, "We have no power to be lost." No, but Allah is pleased to be united. He is pleased to be like them. And He has revealed to you the Book from your Lord, and He has revealed to you in the Day of Resurrection. He knows the wrong-doers.
And if the People of the Book had believed and guarded (from evil), We would certainly have found them from their sins, and We would have made them enter gardens of bliss.
And if they had followed the Torah and the Gospel, and the Gospel from their Lord, We had certainly made them out from above them, and We have brought out from them from their feet. Some of them are a moderate community; and most of them are evil.
O Prophet, do is what has been revealed to you from your Lord. If you do not, you will not have conveyed His message. God will protect you from you. He will protect you from you. God does not guide you.
Say: 'People of the Book! Do not follow it until you follow the Torah and the Gospel, and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord." And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, some of them added hard and increase their disbelief. So do not grieve for the unbelievers.
Those who believe in Allah and the Jews and the Christians and the Christians and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do righteous deeds, shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
We took a covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent Messengers to them. And whenever a messenger came to them, they would not desire with their own desires, but they were a group of them, and they were a group of them.
And they thought that they have been blind, but they turned blind and blind, and Allah turned them to mercy. Then, He turned away from them, and they were blind. And Allah sees what they do.
Those who disbelieve say: 'Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary." And the Messiah said, "Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord, and your Lord." And whoever ascribes partners to Allah, the Fire, the Fire, and the Fire, and the Fire is the Fire. And the wrong-doers is the unjust.
Those who say, "Allah is the third of the Three." There is no god but He. They say, "There is no god but He. So if they do not desist, the disbelievers will have a painful punishment.
Will they not turn to God and ask forgiveness of His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger; and he passed away before him, and his mother was a saintly woman, and they both ate food. See how We explain Our signs to them, how they see.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which you do not have any power to harm or profit you? And Allah is All-hearing, All-knowing.
Say: 'O People of the Book! Do not follow your religion in falsehood, and do not follow the desires of those who have gone astray, and they have gone astray before many people, and they have strayed from the right path.
Cursed of the Children of Israel (Jesus) who were bent on denying the Children of Israel, Jesus, son of Mary, Jesus, son of Mary, the son of Mary. That was because they rebelled in rebellion and transgression.
They did not forbid one another, but they used to do evil deeds.
Thou seest many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is what their souls have forwarded. Evil is the evil of their souls, and they will abide in the punishment of Allah. They will abide in the torment of God.
And if they believe in Allah and the Messenger and what has been sent down to him, they would not have taken friends for them, but most of them are believers.
You will find the Jews among the Jews and the Jews in the way of those who believe in the way of Allah. They say, "We are Christians and Christians." That is because they say, "We are Christians and monks." That is because of them are priests and monks.
And when they listen to what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears with tears. They say, "Our Lord, we are our Lord, so write us witness to the witnesses.
And why should we not believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, and we hope that our Lord will admit us to the righteous of the righteous.
So Allah rewarded them for gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of the righteous.
And those who disbelieve and belied Our signs, they shall be the inmates of Hell.
O you who believe! Do not prohibit the lawful things which has been lawful for you, and do not exceed the limits; indeed Allah does not love the transgressors.
Eat of what Allah has provided lawful for you and good things, and be wary of God, and fear Him.
And that Allah may not make you a thing for that which ye have no fear, nor that you should not be able to do in the wealth of your wealth, nor that you may not be able to give the property of your wealth, nor do they give you a portion of the needy, or that they may not be able to feed you, or that they may not be able to give you a burthen, or that you may not be able to give the poor, or that you may not be able to give the poor. Thus Allah makes His commandments to you so that you may give thanks.
O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, gambling, and divining arrows are abominations of Satan. Avoid them, so that you may be successful.
Satan only seeketh to create enmity between you and to make enmity between you and to make you forget from the remembrance of Allah and the establishment of prayer, so that you will not desist?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and beware, but if you turn away, know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to preach.
There is no blame for those who believe and do righteous deeds in what they have eaten (in the past], nor fear of what they have done, and do righteous deeds and do righteous deeds, and fear Allah and do righteous deeds. And Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! Allah will surely test you in the game of the game and your spears, so that He may test those who fear Him and fear Him. And whoever transgresses after him, there is a painful punishment for him.
O you who believe! Do not be in the game of a game, when you are in a journey, and when you have brought it, it is for a man who are a means of animals for you, so that it may be a means of a man for you. That is an obligation for a man who have been given a means of a means of a year for it is a means for a man who have been a means of a means of a man who is rich. That is the matter for the people who have done it. God is Majestic and All-powerful.
It is lawful for you the game of the sea and the food for you, and the provision for you and for the travellers. It is forbidden for you to hunt in the land, but to hunt in the land. And fear Allah, to Whom you will be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, and the Sacred Month, and the sacrificial Month, and the sacrificial animals. That is that you know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. God has knowledge of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger is only only to convey the message, and Allah knows what you conceal and what you hide.
Say: "The bad and the good are not equal, though the abundance of the bad attract you. So fear Allah, O men of understanding, if you may prosper."
O you who believe! Do not ask about things about that which Allah has revealed to you, and if you are resolved to make it seem to you, they will be revealed to you. And if you ask the Qur'an, they will be revealed to you. God is Forgiving and Forbearing.
A people before you asked questions, but they disbelieved, and they disbelieved.
Allah has not appointed the rites of Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah, and the Hami, and the Hami, and the Hami. They are the unbelievers, but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger," they say: "Enough for us is that we found our fathers following." Even if their fathers had no knowledge, they have no knowledge of their fathers.
O ye who believe! Guard your own souls. If ye are guided, he will not harm you, nor harm you. To Him is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
O ye who believe! When ye take a place of a place of death, then let a two part of two of them, and two of two of you excel others, but if you are able to go forth, then if you are in the land, then then you will have believed, then if you are about, then they will have been entrusted to you. And Allah will say between them, and we shall be the witness of the truth.
And if it is that the two of them are guilty, then two of them have a share of perjury, and two of them swear by their religion, saying, "Our testimony is truer than our testimony, and we do not transgress, and we do not transgress, and we shall be among the wrongdoers.”
That is nearer that they may be more truthful than that which they have no testimony, or that they may be afraid of their oaths, or fear that they may be afraid of their oaths. And fear Allah, and Allah guideth not the transgressing people.
On the day when He will gather them all together, He will say: "What is what you did?" They say, "We have no knowledge of this. You have no knowledge of the unseen."
And remember when Allah said to the son of Mary: "Suckle Me (Jesus), and remember that I may take Thy favour to Him and His mercy, and when you make a son from the mount of the mountain, I shall have given him a pair of jinns." And when We have given you the Book, the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Torah), the Injeel (Torah), the Injeel (Torah), the Injeel (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Taurat (Torah), and the Taurat (Torah), and the Taurat (Torah), had the right (proofs, evidences, etc, etc, etc, etc.), and the Messengers said: "This is nothing but clear sorcery." And when the truth came to you with clear proofs, the unbelievers said, "This is nothing but plain sorcery."
And when I revealed to the disciples, "Believe in Me and My Messenger," they said, "We believe, and bear witness to us."
And when the disciples said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord able to send down upon us a table from heaven?” He said, “Fear Allah, if you are believers.”
They said: "We wish that we may eat of our hearts and our hearts, and that we may know that we have spoken to us, and that we may be witnesses."
Jesus (Jesus), son of Mary, said: "O Allah, our Lord, send down for us a table (rain), to bring us a feast from the heaven, and to be a festival for us and the last of us, and a sign for us, and give us, and You are the Best of providers."
Allah said, "I will send it down to you. But whoever disbelieves, I shall punish you with the punishment, and I will punish him with a punishment which I will not punish him."
And when Allah said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, is the son of Mary. Do you not think that Allah will make me go to me?" He said, "Do you say to me?" He says, “You have no knowledge of this.” Say, “You have no knowledge of what you have no knowledge.” He knows what you do not know.
I did not say to them except that I commanded them, but Allah is my Lord, and your Lord. And I were a witness over them, and I was a witness over them; and when You had brought me out, You watched them over them, and You are the Observer over all things.”
If You punish them, they are Your servants; and if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say, "This is the day when the truthful will be truthful, for them will be gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. God is pleased with them, and they will be pleased with Him. That is the great attainment.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and He has power over all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the light. Yet those who disbelieve equate their Lord as equals.
It is He who created you from clay, then He appointed a term for you, and a term is fixed for Him; then you are in doubt.
He is Allah in the heavens and the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you disclose, and He knows what you do.
And there comes to them a sign from the signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it.
Indeed, the truth has come to them, but they denied the truth, and they will come to them the news of what they used to ridicule.
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them, whom We had established in the earth as We had not established you, and We sent upon them abundant rains of showers, and We sent upon them gardens beneath the rivers flow, and We destroyed them for their sins. Then We destroyed them for their sins.
And if We had sent down to you a Book in parchment, then they would have touched it with their hands, those who disbelieve say: This is nothing but plain magic.
And they say, “Why has not an angel been sent down to him?” If We sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided, and they would not have been respited.
And had We made him an angel, We would have made him a man, and We would have made him a man in which they are confused.
And indeed the Noble Messengers were sent before you, but those who scoffed at them were encompassed by what they used to deride.
Say: "Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who rejected (the Truth)."
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "It is Allah. He has prescribed for Himself mercy. On the Day of Resurrection, there is no doubt about Him. Those who have lost their souls will not believe.
To Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Say: 'Shall I take a protector other than Allah, the originator of the heavens and the earth, and Who feeds for it and sustenance." Say: "I am commanded to be the first of the first, and I am commanded to be the first of those who submit."
Say: "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous Day."
On that day the punishment shall be averted, for him is the punishment of Allah; and that is the manifest achievement.
If Allah touch you with affliction, there is none who can remove it but He. If He makes you good good, He has power over all things.
He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise, the Wise.
Say to them, "This is the truth." Say, "I am only a witness over Allah." And I have revealed to you that which is revealed to you, and you will have revealed to those who believe with you. Say, "What is with God." Say, "I do not bear witness with Allah. I am not responsible."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. Those who have lost their souls will not believe.
And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah and denies His signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.
On the day when We gather them all together, We shall say to those who ascribed partners to Allah: "Where are those whom you used to be partners?"
Then they would not say, "God is our Lord, the Lord of our Lord, we were not equal to us."
Look, how they lie against the lie, and what they used to invent has vanished from them.
And among them are some who listen to you, and We have put veils over their hearts, and they understand lest they understand their ears, and heaviness in their ears. And if they see them, they will not believe in it. And when they come to thee with thee, they say, “This is nothing but myths of the ancients.”
And they turn away from it, and turn away from them. They ruin none except themselves, but they do not know.
And couldst you see when they are confronted with the Fire, and they will say: "Would that we had been returned to us, and we will not reject the signs of our Lord."
Nay, but they used to hide what they had been concealing, and if they were returned to, they would return to what they had been forbidden. Indeed, they are liars.
And they say, “There is nothing but the life of this world; and we shall not be raised up again.”
If you could see them when they are brought before their Lord, He will say: "Is this not the truth?" They will say: "Yes, by our Lord!" They will say: "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say: "Taste the punishment because of which ye used to disbelieve."
Those who deny the meeting of Allah will be losers. On the Day when when the Hour comes upon them, they say, "Alas for us! Alas, we shall bear our burden." They will bear their burdens on their backs. How evil is what they do.
The life of this world is nothing but a sport and a sport. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for the pious. Will you not then understand?
We know that they say what they say, and they do not answer you, but they deny the revelations of Allah.
And indeed many messengers have been denied before you, and they were patient until they endured steadfastly and they were patient until the help of Allah came to them. There is no altering the words of Allah. And there has come to you the news of the Messengers.
And if their turning away is hard for thee, then if thou wilt see the earth, then thou thou have a ladder to the sky, or bring them a sign to them. And if Allah willed, He could have guided them all. So do not be of the ignorant.
Only those who listen (to the Truth). They are the ones who listen to Him, and the dead will be brought back to the Day of Resurrection.
They say: "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Allah is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
There is no animal on the earth, nor a bird of the earth, nor a bird of its wings. We are nothing but a Book. We have no knowledge in this.
Those who reject Our revelations are deaf and dumb in darkness. God leads astray whomever He wills, and guides whom He wills. He guides whomever He wills.
Say: "Have you considered, if Allah's punishment comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, if you are truthful, will you call to God any other than Him?
In fact, He will call you to Him, and He will remove that which you call upon Him, and He will remove that which you associate with Him.
And indeed We sent messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW) to nations, and We seized them with distress and distress, so that they may humble (their prayers).
Then why did they not submit when Our punishment came to them, but they humble themselves, and their hearts hardened, and Satan made their deeds seem fair to them.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened for them the gates of the doors, and when they rejoiced in what they had been given, We seized them suddenly, while they were despondent.
So the people of Pharaoh were destroyed. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.
Say, "Have you considered, if God has put your hearing and your hearts, and your hearts, and your hearts, and set your hearts in your hearts. He is a god other than Him. So they turn away, so they turn away.”
Say: "Have you considered, if Allah's punishment comes upon you suddenly or openly, will you be destroyed except the wrongdoing people?"
And We send the Messengers as a bearer of good tidings and as givers of good tidings. And whoever believes and reforms, shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And as for those who reject Our signs, they shall be seized by a humiliating punishment.
Say: 'I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen. Nor do I say that I am an angel. I follow what is revealed to me what is revealed to me." Say: "Are the blind and the seeing alike? Will you not then reflect?
And warn those who fear their Lord before them, that they may have no guardian besides Allah, nor any intercessor or intercessor.
And do not turn away from those who call their Lord morning and evening, seeking His countenance. You are not accountable for you, nor is they accountable for them. You do not ask you from what you do not do, and you will turn away from them.
And thus We made some of them a test in order that they may say: "Are these the people whom Allah has favoured among us?" But Allah does not guide those who do not know.
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: Peace be upon you! Thy Lord is gracious to Himself. He has prescribed for you the evil of ignorance, and thereafter repents, and thereafter, then He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Thus do We explain Our revelations, and this is the way of the guilty.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I have been forbidden to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah." Say: "I do not follow your desires, lest I have gone astray, and I have gone astray, and I will not be among the guided."
Say: 'I am only a clear proof from my Lord, and you deny the truth. You do not hasten what you hasten to hasten. The decision is only with Allah. He relates the truth. He is the Best of deciders."
Say: "If you were impatient for what you wish to hasten, it would have been settled between me and me." And Allah knows best the wrong-doers.
He knows the keys of the unseen, the keys of the unseen. He knows what is in the earth and the sea. No leaf is He, and He knows it, but He knows the earth and the earth, but there is nothing but a grain in the earth, but there is nothing smaller in a clear Book.
It is He who recalls you in the night, and He knows what you earn of day, then He raises you to die, so that you may be returned to Him. Then to Him you will return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
He is the Conqueror over His servants, and He sends guardians over you. When death approaches you, Our messengers call him to death, and they are not neglectful.
Then they are returned to Allah, their Lord, the True. His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest of reckoners.
Say, "Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him and call upon Him whatever you call upon Him?"
Say, "It is God who delivers you from every evil and from every distress from you, and you associate others besides Him."
Say: "He is Able to send down upon you a power of your hands or from beneath them from His feet, or to make you taste one another factions and make you taste one another. See how We explain Our signs to you, so that they may understand."
And you disbelieve in the truth, and it is the truth. Say: "I am not a guardian over you."
For every soul is a finality, and you will soon know.
And when you see those who gossip in Our revelations, they turn away from you, but if they turn away to you, they do not dispute with one another. And if you forget you, then do not be of the unjust.
For those who fear the duty of Allah, there is no sin for them, so that they may fear.
And (as for) those who have set their religion as a sport and a sport, and the life of this world beguiled the life of this world, and warn the Qur'an, and warn the Qur'an. And they shall not be able to be a ransom for them, and they shall not be able to protect a ransom from Allah. They are the ones who have no power of a painful punishment.
Say: 'Shall I not bring him any other than Allah, or He will not harm it for us, nor will he harm nor harm you, if you are returned to us?" And they are in the hearts of those whose hearts see them, so that they should say to them, "What is the hearts of the people who have been guided." Say, "We have been commanded to follow the guidance of God, and we have been commanded to submit."
And to establish the prayer and fear Him, and He is the Day of Judgment.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. He will say, "Be," His word is the Truth. His is the sovereignty on the Day when the trumpet will be blown. He is the All-Knower, the All-knowing.
And (remember) when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols as gods? I see you, you, and your people, in manifest error.
And thus We gave him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of the believers.
Then when the night covered him, he saw a star rising. He said, "This is my Lord." And when it set, he said, “I do not love those who do not love.”
Then, when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord.” But when it set, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will surely have followed the people who are astray.”
When he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, “My people, I am quit of what you associate with Him.”
I have turned my face towards Him who has created the heavens and the earth, and I am not one of those who associate others with Allah.
His people argued with him. He said, "Do you argue with me about God? He has guided me to me. I do not fear Him as I associate you with Him. My Lord comprehends all things in knowledge. Will you not take heed?
And how should I fear that which ye associate beside Allah, and that ye have not associated with Him any warrant which He has not sent down to you any warrant? Is it any of the two parties?
Those who believe and do not mix their faith, for them shall be security, and they are rightly guided.
And this is Our argument that We gave to Abraham his brother, so We will raise him degrees in degrees. Lo! thy Lord is Wise, Wise.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and We guided them. And We guided Noah before Noah, and his descendants, and Job, Job and Job, Job and Aaron. Thus do We reward the righteous.
And Zakariya and John and John and Elias, and each of them was righteous.
And Ishmael and Elisha, and Lot, and Lot, and We gave them a great reward.
And of their fathers and their descendants, and their brethren, and We chose them and guided them to the right path.
That is the guidance of Allah, He guides whomever He wills of His servants. If they had associated anything other than Him, they would have been annulled.
They are the ones whom We have given the Book and wisdom, and prophethood, and prophethood. And We have made a sign to a people who do not believe in it.
Those are the ones whom Allah has guided. So follow their guidance. Say, "I do not ask you any wage for this. It is only a reminder for the worlds."
And what Allah has not made those who do not say, "He has not sent down any revelation." They say, "He has sent down a Book." Say, "It has been revealed to you that the Book has been sent down to the people, and He has given it to you as He wills. He knows what you do not know.
And this is the Book which We have sent down, confirming what We have revealed before it, confirming what was before it, and those who believe in it, and those who believe in the Hereafter, and those who believe in the Hereafter, and those who believe.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or says, "It is revealed to me, or to it has been revealed to me." Say, "It is God who has sent down the Book." And if you see them, the angels will say, "This is your hands." And if you see it, the angels will say, "This is your disgrace. This is the punishment for those who disobey Allah."
And indeed you are returned to Us, as We created you the first time, and We have given you what We had been given you. And We do not see you with those whom you claimed in God. Indeed, you claimed with those whom you claimed with God.
It is Allah who splits the grain-stone, the date-stone, the date-stone. He brings forth the living from the dead, and He brings forth the living from the dead. That is Allah, then how are you turned away?
It is He Who breaks the dawn, and He made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for calculation. He is the All-mighty, the All-knowing.
And He it is Who hath set the stars for you, that you may be guided by the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the sea and the sea. We have detailed the revelations for people who understand.
And He it is Who has produced you from a single soul, then He has appointed for you a place of sojourning and a place of storage. Verily We have detailed for a people who understand.
It is He who sends down water from the sky, and We bring it grow with every kind of vegetation, and We bring forth thereby kinds of vegetation grow to grow. And We bring forth gardens of date-palms, with clusters of date trees, and olives, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates. In this are signs for people who believe.
And they ascribe up partners to Allah, and He has created them, and He created them, and they impute to Him sons and daughters. Glory be to Him! High be He above what they associate.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He has no consort? He has created everything and He has knowledge of all things.
He is the Lord of your Lord, there is no god but He. So worship Him, and worship Him. He is the Guardian over all things.
No eyes can grasp Him, but He perceives what He wills. He is the Subtle, the Expert.
Indeed, there has come to you from your Lord. So whoever sees it, it is for his own soul; and whoever is blind, it is only for his own soul; and I am not a guardian over you.
Thus do We explain Our revelations to them, and they say: "We have studied," and that We may make it clear to the people who know.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He; and turn away from those who turn away from Allah.
And if Allah had pleased, they would not have associated Him; and We have not made you a guardian over them, and thou art not over them a manager.
Do not insult those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they insult the hostility of ignorance. Thus We have made attractive to every nation their deeds. We have made their deeds attractive to them. Then their Lord will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swear by Allah with their solemn oaths that if there came to them a sign, they would believe in it. Say: 'Signs are with Allah." And what will make you realize that they have come to believe, then they would not believe?
And their hearts and their eyes will come to them, but they will not believe in it, but We will leave them in their insolence, and We shall wander blindly in their trespasses.
And if We had sent down the angels to them, and the dead are gathered to them, and We have gathered them all together before them, they would have believed in it. Even they would not believe unless Allah had willed, but most of them are ignorant.
Thus is how We have made every prophet a prophet from among mankind, and among the jinn, the devils, inspiring them with inspiring themselves. And if your Lord willed, they would not have done it. So leave them, and follow what they fabricate.
And those who do not believe in the Hereafter, so that the hearts of their hearts may incline to them, and that they may be pleased.
Say, “Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, while it is He Who has revealed to you the Book?” And those who gave the Book know that it has been revealed to you from your Lord. So do not be of the doubters.
And the Word of your Lord is the truth and the Last Day. No one can change His words. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
And if most of the people of the earth, they would lead you astray from Allah. They follow nothing but conjecture, and they are merely conjecturing.
Indeed your Lord knows best those who stray from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
So eat of that which Allah hath mentioned, and that which is in the name of Allah eat.
And what is the matter with you that you do not eat that the name of Allah has been mentioned to you, and that which has been forbidden to you, except that which is forbidden to you? They lead only astray from their own desires. Indeed your Lord knows best the transgressors.
Forsake the sin and the sin. Those who commit sin shall be recompensed for what they used to do.
And do not eat that which is in the name of Allah has not been pronounced. Indeed, it is a sin. And the devils inspire their friends to argue with you. If you obey them, you will surely be idolaters.
Is he who was dead, and We gave him life, and We have made him a light of which he walks to one people? Is he equal to one who can bring out the darkness of darkness? Thus the unbelievers have been made fair fair seeming to them.
And thus We have made every city a town in its city, so that they may plot therein. And they do not plot except themselves except themselves, and they do not know.
When a sign comes to them, they say: "We will not believe in it until we do not believe in the Book." Allah knows best where He has given to His servants. The evil-doers will be seized by severe punishment.
So Allah guides to whomever He wills, He expands his breast to Islam. And He makes whomever He wishes to go astray, as if he were climbing to the sky. So He makes it to go astray in the sky, so that they do not believe.
This is the path of your Lord, a straight path. We have detailed for the people who understand.
Their abode will be the Garden of Paradise, and He will be their Protector. He is the Best of reward.
On the day when He will gather them all together, He will say: "Company, the people of jinn." And the group of them will say: "Our Lord, we have enjoyed us from a single term." They will say, "Our Lord, we have enjoyed us from a single term." He will say, "Your Lord, the Fire, the Fire." He will say: "This is your dwelling, and your Lord is Wise."
And thus do We make the wrong-doers among the wrong-doers, because of what they used to earn.
O ye assembly of jinn and mankind! Did there not come to you apostles from among yourselves, relating to you My verses and warning you to warn My signs? They will say: We bear witness against ourselves and the Day of Resurrection? They shall say, "We bear witness against ourselves." And the life of this world is deluded against them.
That is because your Lord does not destroy the towns unjustly while they are unaware of their ignorance.
And for them is degrees for what they have done, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
And your Lord is the Self-sufficient, the All-merciful. If He wills, He could have put you away, and He will replace you for you as He wills, and He will raise you to another people as a descendants.
Indeed that which you have been promised will come to pass, and you cannot frustrate it.
Say: 'O my people! Work according to your station. I am acting to your station. You will know that you will know in the Hereafter. The wrongdoers will not prosper.
And they assign to Allah a share of the cattle and the cattle which He has created for them, and they say, "This is for God." And they say, "This is for Allah." And when they associate their associates, it is not a thing of Allah, and that which they associate is with Allah.
And thus their associates have made the killing of the polytheists, and their children made their children, and made them their religion and their religion. And if Allah had willed, they would not have done it. So leave them with their fabrications, and follow them.
And they say: "These cattle and crops are forbidden, and such not eat what We have forbidden for him." They are forbidden by cattle, and they are forbidden by cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle. They are not fabricating lies against Allah.
And they say: "What is in the bellies of cattle is reserved for our males, and for our wives, and our wives are forbidden." But if it is stillborn, they shall have shares it. He will punish them for their attribution. He is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Lost are they who have killed their children foolishly, without knowledge, without knowledge, and has forbidden what Allah has provided for them, inventing lies against Allah. They have gone astray, and they are not guided.
It is He who produces gardens, trellised, and untrellised, and palm-trees, and the date-palm-palm-trees, and olives, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and unlike, and unlike, and unlike, but eat of its fruit; and do not exceed the fruit of its fruit. Indeed, He does not love the wasteful.
And of the cattle, there are some of burden, and the flesh of the burden. Eat of what Allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is an open enemy to you.
Eight, and the pair of sheep. Say: 'Is it the two males He has forbidden, or the two females, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me with knowledge, if you are truthful.”
And the pair of camels, and the pair of oxen. Say: 'Is it the two males He has forbidden, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or, when Allah commanded you, you would have been charged to you?" And he who invents a lie against Allah, who lead him astray from knowledge? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
Say: 'I have been forbidden to eat that which has been revealed to me to eat of what is forbidden to eat, except carrion, pork, pork, pork, the flesh of swine, the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of God. And whoever is constrained with necessity, not desiring it, and transgress that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And to those who are Jews, We forbade the animal with claws, and the fat of them, and the fat of them, and the fat of what adheres to their backs, except what adheres to their backs, or what adheres to their backs, and that which was mixed to them, We seized them because of their sins; and We are the truthful.
But if they accuse you, say: "Your Lord is the Lord of Mercy and mercy." And none will not be averted from the sinners.
The idolaters will say, "Had Allah willed, we would not have worshipped anything besides Him, nor we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything.” Likewise, those who lived before them cried lies to Our punishment. Say, "Have you bring any proof to us? You follow only surmise. You follow nothing but conjecture. You merely follow conjecture.
Say: "The Book is only for Allah. If He willed, He could have guided you to the right path."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Bring your witnesses (i.e. the Jews), and those who testify against Allah, that they testify not." And do not bear witness with them, and do not follow those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and do not follow the Hereafter, and do not follow the Hereafter with their Lord.
Say: "Your Lord has made lawful to you what you have made unlawful. Do not associate anything with Him, and do not be your partner to your parents. Do not kill your wealth and your children. Do not kill your wealth. We do not be grieved. Do not kill your wealth, but do not kill your property. This is best for you.
And do not approach the property of the orphan except the property of the orphan until he reaches maturity. And give full measure and weight with justice. We do not burden any soul except a soul. We do not burden any soul except it. Do you speak to yourselves, if you speak.
And that it is My path that is straight, so follow it, and do not follow any paths other than it, lest they may lead you away from His path. That is He that you may fear.
Then We gave Moses the Book as a favour for him, and explaining everything in detail, and guidance, and mercy, and mercy, that they may believe in their Lord.
And this is a blessed Book which We have revealed, so follow it and follow it, so that you may receive mercy.
Lest you will say, "The Book has been sent down to two two parties before us, and we have been heedless of their study."
Or lest you should say, "If the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been guided than them.” Indeed, there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and mercy and mercy. Who is more unjust than he who denies the signs of God and turns away from them. We turn away from those who turn away from Our signs.
Are they waiting for the angels, or the angels come to them, or your Lord’s signs comes to you, or the sign of your Lord comes to you, but that the Day of Resurrection comes to him, except that no one of it comes to faith before his faith? Say, "Wait, we too are waiting."
Those who split their religion into sects and sects, there is no concern of them. Their affair is only with Allah. He will inform them of what they used to do.
Whoever brings a good deed, it shall be tenfold for it; and whoever brings an evil deed, it shall be recompensed for it, and they shall not be wronged.
Say: 'My Lord has guided me to a straight path, the religion of Abraham, the upright, the upright, and he was not one of the polytheists.
Say: "My prayer and my sacrifice, and my living, and my living, and my Lord, the Lord of the Worlds.
He has no partner; and I have been commanded to be the first, and I am the first of those who submit.
Say: 'Shall I seek a god other than Allah, while He is the Lord of all things? No soul earns its soul. No soul earns the burden of another soul, and no bearer of burden shall bear another burden. Then your Lord will inform you about what you used to differ.
And He it is Who hath appointed you on the earth, and hath raised some of you ranks over others, that He may test you in what He has given you. Lo! thy Lord is swift in retribution, and He is Forgiving, Merciful.
<unk>.
(This is) the Book which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad SAW), so that you may warn it from your heart, and that it may be no crookedness for the believers.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and do not follow any other other than Him. Little do you take heed.
And how many a town have We destroyed! Our punishment came upon them by night, while they slept.
Then, when Our punishment came to them, they said, "Indeed, we were wrongdoers."
Then We shall question those who have been sent to Our Messenger, and We shall question the messengers.
Then We shall narrate them with knowledge, and We are not absent.
The weighing on that Day is the Truth; and those whose scales are heavy—they are the successful.
And those whose scales are light, it are they who have lost their souls, because they used to deny Our signs.
And indeed We have established you in the earth and made for you a livelihood for you. Little thanks ye thanks.
We created you, then We shaped you, then We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam." Prostrate, "Prostrate to Adam," they prostrated themselves, but he was not of those who prostrated.
He said, “What prevented you that you did not prostrate to what I commanded you?” He said, “I am better than he. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay.”
(Allah) said: "Get down from it! It is not for you to be arrogant in this. Get forth, for you are too, and you will be among the humiliated."
He said, “Respite me until the Day of Resurrection.”
He said: You are of the respited.
He said, “Because You have led me astray, I will surely guide you to a Straight Path.”
Then I will come to them from front of them and from behind them and from their right, and from their right, and from their left, and Thou wilt find no grace of them."
(Allah) said: "Get out from this (Hell), despised, disgraced, and whosoever follows them, I shall fill Hell with you all together."
And We said, "O Adam, dwell and dwell in the Garden and eat of it wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.”
Then Satan tempted them to reveal to them what he had given them, and he said to them, "Your Lord has not forbidden you this tree, lest you may become angels, or become angels.”
And he swore to them, "Indeed, I am your sincere-wisher."
Then he made them slip. Then when they tasted the tree, their shameful parts became apparent to them, and they began to cover the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called out to them, "Did I not forbid you that tree, and I did not forbid you that tree? Indeed, he is an enemy to you."
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, You will surely have been lost."
He said, "Get down, one of you will be enemies. And you will have a dwelling in the earth and a temporary provision for a while.
He said, "Therein you will live, and therein will be it, and you will be brought forth from it.”
O Descendants of Adam! We have given you to cover your private parts, and the adornment of righteousness, and the raiment of righteousness. That is best for the people who understand.
O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan tempt you, as he expelled your parents from Paradise, stripping them their private parts, stripping them their private parts. And he sees you and his tribe, where you can see them. We have made the devils friends of those who do not believe.
And when they commit an indecency, they say, “We found our fathers doing, and Allah has commanded us.” Say, “God does not command His indecency. Do you attribute to God what you do not know?”
Say, "My Lord has commanded justice. So set your faces in every place of worship, and call your face to Him. Pray to Him, and pray to Him, and you will return to Him.
He has guided a guidance, and there has been a party of them. Indeed, they have taken guardians as patrons instead of God. They are the ones who have taken the right path.
O Children of Adam! Take your adornment every adornment, and eat and drink, and do not be wasteful. Indeed, He likes not the wasters.
Say, "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has provided for His servants and the good things which He has provided for His servants?" Say, "These are the present life in this life and the Day of Resurrection." Thus do We explain Our signs for a people who understand.
Say, "My Lord has forbidden indecencies, indecencies, and what is apparent to you, and sin, and unjustified aggression, and that which you associate with God has not sent down any sanction, and that you do not know anything of God, and that which you do not know.
For every nation there is an appointed term; when the term appointed, they cannot delay it, nor can they hasten it.
O Children of Adam, when there come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses, then those who fear God, and those who fear themselves, no fear shall be upon them, nor shall they grieve.
But those who reject Our revelations and treat them, they are the inmates of the Fire; therein they shall abide forever.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or denies His signs? Or shall they have a portion of the Book, until Our angels come to them, (saying), "Where are those whom you used to invoke besides God?" They will say, "We have forsaken us." They will say, "Yes, and we will bear witness against us."
He will say: "Enter the gates of Hell (Hell), and before those who passed away before you, and there is a group of those who passed away (from the Fire)." And when a group of them, they shall say: "Our Lord! We have led us astray, so that it will be the first of them." They will say: "Our Lord! We have led us astray, but the torment of the Fire will touch them." He will say: "It is a double provision."
And the first among them will say to the last of them: "You are not of us, but taste the punishment because of which you used to earn."
Indeed, those who reject Our revelations and turn away against them, the gates of Heaven shall not be opened for them, nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the needle. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.
For them is the bed of Hell, and We have prepared them over them. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall not burden any soul except according to its capacity. These are the inhabitants of Paradise, where they will abide forever.
We shall strip their hearts into their hearts, and they will be admitted to gardens underneath which rivers flow, and they say: "All praise belongs to Allah." And if Allah had not guided us, We would not have guided it. Our Lord's Messengers will say, "We have no guidance. Our Lord's Messengers has brought the truth. This is the Garden which you used to do."
And the companions of the Garden will call out to the companions of the Garden: "We have found that which our Lord promised us." They will say, "We have found what your Lord promised you." They will say, "Yes, but the curse of your Lord will be the curse of the wrongdoers."
Those who bar the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked, and do not believe in the Hereafter.
And between them is a barrier, and on the day of the heights, every people will recognize them, and they will say, "Peace be to you! Peace be to you!" They will not be entered to them, and they will be asked.
