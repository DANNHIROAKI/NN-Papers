In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgment
You worship your worship, and to Him you do.
Guide us to the straight path.
The guidance of those who have been given mercy, the punishment of their Lord is not upon them, nor will they be lost.
Alif, Lam, Meem.
This is the Book of the Book. There is no doubt for those who fear God,
who believe in the Unseen, and perform the prayer, and spend from what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and those who believe in the Hereafter.
These are those who follow their Lord, and are the successful.
Indeed, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not believe.
God has sealed their hearts and their hearing and their ears, and their ears is a covering.
And among them are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," and they do not believe.
They seek to deceive Allah and the believers, but they deceive them, and they perceive not.
In their hearts is a disease which Allah has set in their hearts, and they have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Do not forbid corruption in the land," they say, "We are only reformers."
Indeed, they are the ones who do evil, and they do not perceive.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what they have believed," they say, "Shall we believe in those who believe?" Nay, it is they who believe and do not believe.
When they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," and when they meet them, they say, "We are with you." They say, "We are only mocking."
God will give them respite, and will wander on their trespasses as a while.
Those are they who have bartered error for guidance, and they have no understanding, nor will they be guided.
Their likeness is like the likeness of a man who kindled a fire, and when it lighted it around it, Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness.
Deaf, dumb, blind.
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, which is darkness, thunder, thunder, thunder, and lightning. They fear their fingers in their ears. God is encompassing of the disbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches their sight, and when it covers them, they walk on it, and when it covers them, they walk on it. But if they see their ears, Allah has not able over them, and He has power over all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord Who created you and those before you, so that you may be godfearing.
It is He Who has made the earth a bed for you and the sky, and the sky, and the sky, and the sky, and thereby We have sent down water from the sky, so that you may be able to set up rivals to Allah, and do not set up rivals to Allah.
And if you are in doubt of what We have sent down to the Prophet, then produce a surah with it, and call upon the witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do not, then you will not be able to fear, and fear the Fire which is prepared for the disbelievers, and prepared prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, for them shall be Gardens of which rivers flow, beneath which rivers flow, and they shall be provided with bracelets of which rivers flow, and they shall say: This is what we have been fed. They shall have spouses of which they have been given, and they shall live therein forever, and they shall abide therein forever.
Allah has not ashamed of them a similitude, except for a gnat, and a gnat, and the sight of those who believe, and those who believe in their Lord. Say, "This is what Allah has given them." Thus does Allah leads astray for them, and guides them astray. God does not guide those who are astray.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the land, and are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah, when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, and He will bring you back to life, and to Him you will be returned.
It is He who has created you in the earth, and made the heaven subservient to it, and He has made the heaven subservient to them, and He has knowledge of everything.
And recall when your Lord said to the angels, “I am placing to you a viceroy in the earth.” They said, ‘You will see that you will be able to spread corruption in the earth.’ Your Lord said, ‘Your Lord is the One Who feeds you, and I do not know the prayer, and I know what you do.”
And He taught Adam the names (of Adam), and He fulfilled them with the angels, and said: "Tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You! You have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, You are the Knower, the Wise."
He said, "O Adam, tell them your names." Then when he said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth?" He said, "I know what I reveal and what you conceal."
And (remember) when We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam," they bowed down, but they refused to prostrate themselves except Iblis, and he was one of the disbelievers.
And We said: O Adam! Dwell both of the Garden and your spouse, and eat therein therein, and do not approach this tree, lest ye shall be of the wrongdoers.
Then Satan caused them to slip into the state of the Shaitan, and We said to them, "Go down from the Fire," they said, "We shall draw down from the earth, and for you is a place of settlement for you."
Then Adam learnt from his Lord, saying, "We have heard the Words of your Lord. Indeed, He is all-forgiving and all-merciful."
We said, "Go down to what you have been given to you. It will be no guidance from Me, and whoever follows My guidance will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
But those who deny the truth and deny Our signs -- they are the inmates of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
O Children of Israel, remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant with Me, and fulfill your covenant with Me, and fear Me.
And believe in what I have sent down to you, and be not with those who believe, and do not be like those who deny the truth, and sell My revelations for a paltry price.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth.
And perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and bow down with those who bow down.
What, do you bid yourselves to piety and do not forget yourselves? Do you not understand?
And pray in patience and prayer, and the prayer of the prayer are ever hard.
Those who do not believe in the meeting of their Lord, and to Him they are returned.
O Children of Israel, remember My blessing wherewith I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you to the worlds.
And fear the Day when no soul will avail another another, nor will any ransom be accepted from him, nor will any ransom be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who were afflicting you with a terrible torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women, and was a trial from your Lord.
And (remember) when We parted the sea for you, and drowned Pharaoh's people, and drowned the people of Pharaoh's people.
And We appointed for Moses forty nights, so he took up the Calf, and ye were wont to wrong corruption.
Then We pardoned you, so that you might be grateful.
And We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.
And (remember) when Moses said to his people, "O my people! You have taken a calf from your own people, and kill you, and kill you from your Creator, and kill your sons, and kill your women." He said, "It will be better for you, and He is All-forgiving, All-compassionate."
And recall when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see the scourge of Allah," and behold the thunderbolt struck you.
Then We brought you back to life, that you may be grateful.
And We shaded you with the clouds, and We sent down to you Manna and quails, and the quails and the quails, and We provided for those who do not wrong themselves, but they wronged themselves.
And (remember) when We said to the people of this town, "Dwell therein in this town, and eat therein therein, and enter the gate bowing humbly, and say, "We will forgive your sins, and forgive your sins." We will increase the reward of the righteous.
But the wrongdoers changed those who were unjust to it, so that they had been unjust to it, so We sent down upon them the punishment of the heaven.
And (remember) when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, "Strike your staff." And twelve them gushed down twelve them twelve springs, and he gushed forth from the ground: "Eat of the sustenance of Allah, and do not act corruptly in the land, and do not act corruptly in the land."
And when it was said to them, "Make your place of the Book, we will not go to your people, and make the one of the people who will be the enemy of the people, and the one who is the enemy of the people, and the one who is the enemy of the people, and the other, and the one who is in the sea, and the one who is the enemy of the fire, and the other, and the one who is with them. So Allah will make them taste the faith of the believers, and do not kill those who believe, and they were guilty of the limits of Allah. Thus did they kill the transgressors.
Those who believe, and those who believe, and the Christians, and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do good deeds will have their reward with their Lord, and they will not be saddened.
And (remember) when We made a covenant above you and made the Mount above you, saying, "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what was in it, so that you may be Godwary."
Then ye turned back after it, and would not be able to turn away from Allah and His grace, and that you were of the losers.
And you know those of you who were guilty of the Sabbath, and We said to them, “Be apes, despised,’
So We made it a deterrent for those who were before them, and a admonition for those who fear it, and a lesson for those who fear it.
And recall when Moses said to his people, "God commands you to sacrifice a cow," they said, "Do you ridicule us?" He said, "I fear that you should be one of the ignorant."
They said, "Pray to your Lord to make it clear to us." He said, "It is that your Lord is the cow, the heifer." She said, "It is not for us to speak her."
They said, "Pray to your Lord to make it clear to us." He said, "He says, "He says, "This is a yellow cow, bright, bright, bright, gladdening the beholders."
They said, "Pray to our Lord to make it clear to us what she may be." He said, "This is what we have been taught to us, so that we may be guided."
He said, "He says, "It is not a cow to plow the ground, nor to irrigate the earth." She said, "This is a cow." She said, "We have made it a cow." They said, "It is a cow".
And when you killed a man, then he became a enemy to you, and Allah disclosed you to what you were hiding.
And We said, "Strike him with a piece of the earth." Thus Allah restores the dead to life, and shows you His signs, so that you may understand.
Then your hearts hardened, it would not have been hardened, and We have made ready for them rocks of which rivers flow, and there are rocks from which rivers gush forth, and some of them are rocks, and it is from Allah, and it is not for those who fear it, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you believe that some of them should believe in it, but the one who has heard the Word of Allah, when they heard the truth after they understood it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe." But when they meet them, they say, "This is what Allah has sent down to you." They say, "Their Lord has knowledge of what you have done. Do you not understand your dispute with their Lord? Do you not understand?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose?
And among them are those who do not know the Book except with knowledge, and they do not know anything but conjecture.
So woe to those who write the Book with their Lord, and say, "This is from God." So woe to them for a little price, and woe to them for what they earn. Woe to them for what they have earned.
And they say, "The Fire will not touch us for a limited number of days." Say, "Have you taken a promise from Allah? Do you not know that Allah has promised His promise? Do you not know that Allah does not speak His promise."
Nay, but whosoever earns evil, his works will be the Fire, and they are the inmates of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
But those who believe and do good works, these are the inhabitants of Paradise, and they will abide therein forever.
And when We made a covenant for the Children of Israel, "Worship none but Allah, and to parents, and to relatives, and to the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the traveller, and you turned away.”
And when We made a covenant from you, saying: 'Do not shed your blood, nor your blood, nor your own people; and you ratified it, and you testify.
It is you who will kill you from your own people, and he has made a party of you another, and the one of them, and they were not among you, and you will not be able to make them another, and you will not be able to do it. This is better for you, so that you may believe in the life of this world; and if you do not believe in the life of this world, the life of this world is more in the life of this world, and the life of this world is the greatest losers.
Those are they who have bought the life of this world for the price of the Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And We gave the Book to Moses, and We gave him the Book, and We gave him the Gospel, and We gave him the Gospel, and We gave him the Gospel, and there came to you a apostle with which ye did not believe. And when ye come to you with your mouths, he took it with the light of Allah, and some of the disbelievers.
And they say, "Our hearts are covered." Nay, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe.
And when the Book from Allah has been sent down, confirming that which was before them, and they would not be able to pray to those who were before them, but when they come to them, they said, "Indeed, the Messengers has come to them." But the curse of Allah is upon the disbelievers.
What is they that they have sold their wealth in the price of Allah, that they may believe in it, and that Allah has sent down His mercy upon His bondmen, and He sendeth down His mercy upon whom He pleases, and for them is a disgraceful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what God has sent down," they say, "We believe in what has been sent down to us." And they say, "We believe in what is revealed to us." Say, "God's command is true, if you are believers."
Moses came to you with clear proofs, but you took a calf after it, and you were wrongdoers.
And when We took a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you, saying: 'Hold fast to what We have given you, and say: 'We hear what We have given you.' They said, 'We hear, and the hearts of those who disbelieve.' Say: 'It is that you are believers.'
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If the abode of the Hereafter is for you in the home of the Hereafter, the Hereafter will be for you, if you are truthful."
And they will never long for it, because of what their hands have forwarded, and Allah knows best those who are unjust.
And you will find them to take the greediest of those who associate others in the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the world. But he will not be able to give him a thousand of life. But Allah sees what they do.
Say, “Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel, he has come to him from the Holy Qur’an, confirming what was before it, confirming what was before it, and a guidance and good news for those who believe.”
Whosoever is the enemy of Allah, His angels and His angels, and the enemy of the devil, and the Michael, and the enemy of Allah; and Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.
And We have sent down to you a clear signs, so that they deny not.
Why did they not make it a covenant, and it is a group of them who made it a covenant? Yet most of them do not believe.
And when a messenger came to them from Allah, confirming that which they have been given to them, a party of those who were given the Book hath been given to the Book of Allah, and they are not aware of it.
And they entered the people with the other, and they were in the company of the people, and they were stiff-necked in the presence of the people, and We gave them the Book, and the one who had followed the other, and the other, and the other, and those who were with them, and they had been wronged. So We have made them a burden for those who do not believe in the life of this world, and they have been wronged, and We have made it as a good deed, and he who is in the Hereafter is the wares of the Hereafter, and they are not in the Hereafter.
And if they had believed and feared the good, they would have been better-doers.
O you who have believed, do not say to the believers, "Do not listen to your words," and say, "It is only a painful punishment."
Those who disbelieve in the Book and the polytheists have not given any good to you, except that the good of your Lord has been sent down to you. God chooses His mercy from whomever He wills, and Allah is dispenser of grace.
Whether We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We shall bring it to a better, or know it. Do you not know that Allah is Able to do all things?
Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah you have no protector or helper?
Or do you question the Messenger to question your Messenger before what was asked before you? Whosoever exchanges the faith of disbelief, he has been guided from the right path.
Many of the People of the Book wish that they may believe in it, and believe in their hearts, that they may believe in their hearts, and believe in the truth after it has come to them. And pardon them until Allah commands His command. God has power over all things.
And establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity, and do not give your charity to Allah; and whatever you do, Allah is not aware of what you do.
And they say, "None will be a Jew or a Christian." They are only their wishful fancies. Say, "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Yes, but whosoever submits his Lord in the way of Allah, his reward is with his Lord, and he shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians are not equal to the Jews and the Christians." They will say, "The Jews, the Christians are the same." They say, "It is with the same." On the Day of Resurrection, they will judge between them. On the Day of Resurrection, God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they used to differ.
And who is more unjust than he who prevents the mosques of Allah, and strives in the mosques of God, and striveth not in the mosques, nor shall they be raised up in their places, and they shall have a disgraceful punishment in the life of this world, for them is a disgraceful punishment.
To Allah belong the east and the west, and to Him you will be returned. God is the Embracer, the Knower.
They say, "God has taken a son." Glory be to Him. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. To Him belongs all things.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees a thing, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.
And those who do not say, "Why does Allah not speak to us, or has a sign come to us?" They say, "We have come to us." Their hearts are like the same ones. We have made the signs clear to those who believe.
Indeed We have sent you as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and there is no doubt for you for the inmates of the Fire.
The Jews and the Christians will not be pleased with you, even if they follow the right path, and they will follow your religion. Say, "This is the guidance of Allah." And if you follow the knowledge of Allah, they will follow your desires, and will not find a protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it ought to read it. Those who believe in it will believe in it. Those are the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you to the worlds.
And fear the Day when no soul will avail another another, nor will any ransom be accepted from it, nor will any ransom be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And when Abraham made the promise of his Lord, and he fulfilled them, and said, “I will make you a leader of you.’ Abraham said, ‘I am a leader of you.” Abraham said, ‘My Lord does not include me.”
And (remember) when We made a place of the sanctuary a place for the people, and We made it a place of worship for the people, and We said: 'Take the prayer for Abraham, and establish the House of Abraham, and those who circle for him, and those who bow down for My House and those who bow down for those who bow down.
And (remember) when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city a peaceful territory, and provide its people from the earth, and do not believe in those who believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said, "I will give him a share of the life of the world, and whoever disbelieves in the life of this world, I shall give him a dreadful punishment."
And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, "Our Lord, accept us from us. Indeed, You are the All-hearing, the All-knowing."
And our Lord, make us submissive to our Lord, and to make us submissive to our descendants, and to make our descendants submissive to Him, and accept our repentance, and forgive us. You are the Forgiver, the Merciful.’
Our Lord, raise them to a people who have come to them, and teach them the Book, and teach them the Book and wisdom; and Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.
And who is more unjust than he who follows his religion, but he was one of him who chose himself, and he We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Surrender," he said, "I am going to submit to the Lord of the Universe."
And Abraham was made to his father, and he said, “O my sons, God has chosen for you a religion, and you have faith in God, and do not believe in the Muslims.’
What, when death approached you, when he was said to his sons, "Do you worship me?" They said, "We will worship God, your father, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the brothers of Abraham, the One, the One, the One, the One, the One, the One."
That is a nation who have passed away, so they will be repaid for what they earned, and you will not be questioned about what they did.
And they say, "Become Jews or Christians, it will be the same." Say, "It is the same one who follow the creed of Abraham, and he was not one of the polytheists."
Say, "We believe in God and in what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to us, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and to what was given to Moses, and to their Lord, and to Him we submit."
And if they believe in those who believe, they will be guided to it. But if they turn away, they are only in schism. And Allah is sufficient for you, and He is the Hearer, the Knower.
"That is Allah, the best, which is better than us, who is better than Allah, and to Him we worship?"
Say, "Shall I tell you concerning God? Our Lord is our Lord, and our Lord, and our deeds, and your deeds, and we are your Guardian, and what you are commanded."
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, "Have you better than Allah?" Who is more unjust than he who conceals the testimony of Allah? God is not unaware of what you do.
That is a nation who have passed away. They will have what they earned, and you will be questioned about what you used to do.
The fools of the people will say, "What has turned them away from their qiblah?" Say, "To Allah belong the east and the west. He guides whomever He wills and guides whomever He wills."
And We have made you a single community, and We have made it a clear community, and a party of the people, and the other, and the witnesses, and the other, and the witnesses. And it was not for those who followed him, so that he may be a enemy from his Lord. And Allah guides him that He may not guide those who believe. Surely Allah is All-compassionate, All-compassionate.
We have seen you find the way of the heaven, so that you may turn your faces towards the direction of the Sacred Mosque, so that you may turn your faces towards the direction of the Sacred Mosque, so that you may turn your faces towards the direction of the Book. This is the truth from your Lord. It is the truth from their Lord. God is not unaware of what they do.
And if thou wert of those who have been given the Book, they will not follow it, nor follow the direction of your qiblah, nor follow the direction of their qiblah. And if they follow the guidance, they will follow the direction of it; and if thou wert of the wrong-doers.
Those to whom We have given the Book recognise it as they recognize their sons, and the party of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.
And every one is one who turns away from it, and vie in good works, and vie in good works; and Allah will bring you all together. God is Able to do all things.
Wherever you turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, the Holy Mosque has come to you from your Lord. Indeed, Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn away from it, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and do not incline to the Sacred Mosque, and do not follow your faces, and do not fear them, lest you fear them; and fear Me, and I fear that you may be grateful.
(Muhammad), We have sent you as a Messenger from among you, to recite Our revelations to you, and to teach you the Book, and to teach you the Book and wisdom, and teaching you what you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and remember Me, and do not be ungrateful.
O you who have believed, pray in patience and prayer, for Allah is with the patient.
And do not say to those who are slain in the way of Allah, "Nay, but they are dead."
And We will certainly test you with the good of what We have given you, and of the good and the good, and the life of good, and the good, and the steadfast and the steadfast.
Those who misfortune befalls them, say, "We are God's servants, and we are returning to Him."
They are the ones who are with their Lord and mercy, and they are the guided.
The Safa and the Marwa are those who are in the sight of Allah. Whoever performs the House of the House, he shall not be able to reach the needy or the Umrah. Whoever is the duty of the poor. God is All-forgiving and All-knowing.
Those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance which We have sent down to them, it is they who have been given the Book, and Allah will curse them with the cursers, and curse them.
except those who repent, and make amends, and make amends. Indeed, I am the Oft-forgiving, the All-merciful.
Those who disbelieve, and die, and die, Allah's curse is the curse of God and the angels.
They will live therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
Your God is God, there is no god but He, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
And the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the day, and the day, and the day, and the moon, and the day of which He has sent forth the winds, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, in the heavens and the earth. Surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.
And among mankind are those who take up rivals to Allah, and they love Allah, and love the love of Allah; and those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and when they see the punishment, they will know that Allah is severe in punishment.
And when those who followed them, they will be seized by the punishment, and they will be seized by their forelocks and their feet.
And those who will say, "If only we had a chance, we would not have followed them." Thus, they will say, "It is for us that we have disowned them." Their deeds will be covered by their deeds, and they will not be able to frustrate the Fire.
O mankind! Eat of what is in the earth and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is a enemy to you.
He commands you to commit indecency and indecency, and what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has sent down," they say, "It is not for us to follow anything." They say, "We found our fathers following the right path."
The example of those who disbelieve is like the likeness of a man who calls not to the call of a man, and the deaf and the deaf hear, but they are deaf.
O you who have believed! Eat of the good things We have provided for you, and give thanks to God, if you worship Him.
He has forbidden you for the flesh of the dead, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine. And whosoever does not impose any sin after it, nor shall he be wronged. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Those who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Book, and purchase a small price, it shall be for them a fire, and their bellies will be upon the Day of Resurrection, nor shall Allah speak them to the Day of Resurrection. For them is a painful punishment.
These are the ones who bought error for guidance, and forgiveness from the price of the price of the people, and they will be made to be a resort for the Fire.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel)], and the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] has been sent down in the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] and the Injeel (Gospel) in the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] are in the Book.
And to the people of the east and the earth, it shall be the same for those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the traveller, and those who are the right, and those who believe, and those who keep their right hand, and those who are the right, and those who pay the right hand, and those who pay the right hand, and those who are the truthful and the wayfarer.
O you who have believed, you will come to you in the life of this world, and there is a matter for you, and he is a man who has a share to his wife, and he is a man who has a share to his parents, and he is a man of his own relatives; and he who is given his duty to his own accord, it is not for him to be a believer; and whoever does not desire to do it, he will have a sign from his Lord. And whoever transgresses after it is a painful punishment.
And there is a lesson for you in the life of this world, for the men of understanding, so that you may fear.
Prescribed to you, when death approaches death, he should bequeath it to parents and relatives, and the needy and the wayfarer. This is a duty for the righteous.
Then whoever alters the bequest after it has come to it, it is the sin of those who change it; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
But if any one fears the sin of the testator, or a sin on the parties, then he shall be a sin between them, and he is no sin on the parties. Surely Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
O you who have believed, it is prescribed for you before the first time which was before you, so that you may be Godwary.

And We gave him the Book, the Book, the Torah, the Gospel.
And We sent the covenant with the Children of Israel, and said: 'I am with you a sign from your Lord, and I have given you a sign from the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and I have brought it forth from the earth, and the earth, and the earth; and it will be said to them: 'Go forth from the land; and Allah will bring it forth, and you will be informed of what you did.'
And I have been given the Taurat of the Torah, which has been revealed to me, confirming what was in the Torah, and to make lawful to your people, and to make a sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me.
Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path."
When Jesus sensed their disbelief, he said, "Who will be my helpers?" The disciples said, "God is the helpers of God. We believe in God and the witnesses."
Our Lord, we believe in what is revealed to us, and the believers, and follow the witnesses."
And they schemed, and they schemed, and Allah is the best of planners.
When Allah said, "O Jesus, I shall raise you to Myself, and purify you with those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve in the Day of Resurrection, and I will raise you to the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me will be the return of those who deny the Day of Resurrection, and to Him you will be returned.
As for those who disbelieved, I shall punish them with a terrible punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.
And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages in full, and Allah does not like the wrongdoers.
These are the revelations of the Book which We recite to you, the verses of the Wise, the Wise.
The example of Jesus with Jesus is like the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, and then said, "Exist."
This is the truth from your Lord, therefore be not of the doubters.
And if any of you come to you concerning the knowledge of knowledge, say: 'We will summon our sons and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your women, and your women, and ourselves, and ourselves, and let us call to Allah, the curse of the liars.'
This is the true story. There is no god but He, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
But if they turn away, then surely Allah knows the agents of corruption.
Say, "O People of the Book, we have come to you in the Book, and to be a common one of us, and we do not associate any other than Allah, nor will we associate any other than Him." And if they turn away, they say, "Bear witness to Allah, if we are believers."
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham, and the Gospel after the Torah and Gospel? Why do you not understand?
You have disputed in what you have disputed. Do you dispute about that which you have no knowledge? God knows what you do.
Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian; he was a upright man, and he was not of the polytheists.
The people of Abraham who followed him is a man who follow the truth, and the upright ones, and the believers; and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
A party of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they lead themselves astray, but they do not perceive.
O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah, while you are truthful?
O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and conceal what you conceal?
And a party of the People of the Book said: "Believe in the Book of that which has been sent down to the believers, and that they may believe in it, and that they may turn back to it."
And do not follow those who follow the religion of your Lord, lest you say, "This is the guidance of Allah." Say, "Have you not been for those who have been given the Book, so that you should not have been given to your Lord." Say, "God gives to whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills. God is All-forgiving and All-knowing."
He singles to His mercy whomever He wills; and Allah is dispenser of grace.
And among the People of the Book is he who will take it back to you, and if thou trustest them with a dinar, he will not be able to release them with a dinar; and if thou trustest him with a dinar, he will not say to him: 'This is the matter of Allah.' They say, 'It is not for us.' Allah is not aware of what they do.
Yes, but he who fears his covenant, and fears Allah, He loves the pious.
As for those who sell their oaths with a small price, and a small price, they shall have no share in the life of this world, nor shall Allah speak them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. They will have a painful punishment.
And among them there is a party who distort the Book with their tongues, and it is a heaviness in the Book, and they say, "This is from Allah." They say, "It is from Allah." But it is not from Allah, but they are not aware.
It is not for any human being that Allah has given him the Book and wisdom and prophethood, and he would say to the people, "Be in my Lord." Say, "My Lord is with those who do not believe in this Book and in the Book, so that you may be studying."
And he would not say to the angels, "Why did you command your Lord," so that you should have faith in His command?
And recall what time We sent the covenant with Allah, confirming the Book, confirming that which is before you, confirming that which is before you, confirming that which is before you, and he will say: Believe in it. And if you obey him, he will be said to him, 'Be,' and it is. And they said: 'We affirm what you say.' They said, 'Be' and I am witness to you.'
But those who turn away from it, it is they who are the transgressors.
Do they desire to worship God's religion, to Allah belongs the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned.
Say, "We believe in God and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to us, Ishmael and Isaac, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Prophets, and we have not believed in their Lord. We have believed in that which we have been commanded."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted for him, and he will be among the losers.
How can Allah guide those who believe after their belief after they have believed, and that they should believe in the truth after it has come to them? And Allah does not guide the unjust.
Those are they who have bartered their duty to Allah, and the angels, and the angels.
They will live therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
Except those who repent afterwards and reform. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
Those who believe after their belief, then die, then repent, their repentance will be accepted, and they are the losers.
As for those who disbelieve, and die, and die, they will not be able to offer a ransom to the earth, nor will he be accepted from it. For them is a painful punishment.
It is not for you to do good than the good, and do not spend you for what you spend. God knows whatever you do.
And the Children of Israel was not lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel was given to the Torah, and the Taurat was revealed to it. Say: 'Bring down the Torah, and be of the witnesses.'
But whoever fabricates a lie against Allah, then indeed they are the wrongdoers.
Say, "God has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not one of the polytheists."
The first House of the first House was the first one of Bakkah, a guidance and a guidance for the nations.
There are clear signs in the Book, a man who enters the station of Abraham. Whoever enters the House of the House, he will be safe in the House of the House, and he who is a pilgrimage to the House to come to him, it is not for those who believe, and Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say: 'People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, and know that Allah is with what you do'
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you hinder those who believe in the way of Allah, seeking to make it crooked? God knows what you do."
O you who have believed! If you obey a party of the People of the Book, they will turn to you, so that you may believe.
And how can you disbelieve, when you are recited to you, and the Messenger of Allah? And Allah chooses, and guides him to the right path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah, and fear Him, and do not believe in the believers.
And hold fast to the way of Allah, and hold fast to the remembrance of Allah, and do not make it to be united by your hearts, and He has made you taste the hearts of your hearts, and He has made you taste your hearts, and He has made you taste the Fire, that you may enter the Fire. And Allah has made clear to you His signs, so that you may be guided.
And there will be a group among you who will follow it, and enjoin the right and forbid the good, and those who do evil, these are the successful.
Do not be like those who divided their religion and differed after it has come to them. For them is a great punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be bright and some faces will be blackened, and they will be told, "Did you believe in that which you used to disbelieve? Then taste the punishment for your disbelief."
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the revelations of Allah which We recite to you in truth; and Allah does not guide the unjust.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Allah all matters are returned.
This is a group of the people of the Book, which is good and good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, so that you may believe in Allah and the Last Day, and if they believe in it, it is better for them. Some of them are ungodly.
They will not be able to harm you, but if they fight against you, they will be enemies to you, and they will not be helped.
They will be pitched upon one another, and they will be pitched with a guardian from Allah, and they will be made to be blamed from the wrath of Allah, and they have made the wrath of Allah, and they have made the way of the Prophets. That is because they disbelieved in the signs of Allah, and because they were ungodly.
They are not equal to the People of the Book, but those who recite the Book of Allah, and prostrate themselves in the night.
They believe in God and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is right and forbid the good. These are the righteous.
And those who do not have any reward, it will be their reward; and Allah is well aware of those who do good.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them aught against Allah. They are the inmates of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
The likeness of those who spend the life of this world is like the freezing of a freezing wind, a wind, and a heavy wind strikes it. And Allah wronged them, but they wronged themselves.
O you who have believed, do not take other witnesses with one another, even though they are your friends, they will not harm you. Hatred is more worse than their mouths. They are more worse than their mouths. We have made clear to you a sign, so that they may understand.
Those are you who love you in love, and you love them in the Book, and they say, "We believe in it." And when they meet you, they say, "We believe." But when they meet you, they bite their fingers in their rage. Say, "God knows what is within the breasts."
And if good befalls you, it grieves them, but if misfortune befalls you, they rejoice in it; and if you are patient, they rejoice in it, and Allah knows what they do.
And recall what time when you entered the house of the house of the house of the house of the believers, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.
When two parties among you were among you, but Allah has made them a party of them, and Allah loves the believers.
And Allah has helped you with a great victory, so that you might be victorious, and fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?"
Yes, if you are patient and cautious, and the enemy of your Lord come to you, then your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels.
And Allah has not sent down for you a good news, so that He might give you a good news for your hearts. And Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
And that He may cut off the unbelievers, or that they may cut off their hands, or that they may be disappointed.
It is not for you to ask any of them, or can He punish them or punish them.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whomever He wills. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled, doubled, and fear God, so that you may prosper.
And fear the Fire prepared for the unbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, that you may be shown mercy.
And vie with forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden which is in the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.
Those who spend the wealth of prosperity and adversity, and those who curb their anger, and spend in the way of Allah, and Allah loveth those who do good.
And those who, when they commit a indecency, do not make their own souls, and remember Allah, and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives Allah and His forgiveness, and who does not persist in the least-doing, and they persist not.
Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. Such is the reward of the workers.
Before you, have gone away before you, and travel in the land, and see what was the end of those who denied the truth.
This is a reminder for mankind, and a guidance and a admonition for those who guard (against evil).
And do not grieve, nor grieve, and you are believers.
If a wound has touched you, a similar wound has touched them, so that they may be like those who have been able to believe, and that Allah may make those who believe in the way of Allah; and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may purge those who believe and do the believers.
What, do you think that you will enter Paradise as God has made known to you those who were steadfast in His cause, and who are steadfast?
You were longing for death before you met the death of death, and you did not see it.
Muhammad is not the Messenger of the Prophet, but many of the Noble Messengers before him. If you turn back, he will not be able to kill him, nor will he turn on his heels, and then will he turn back on his heels, and will not harm him. God will reward the grateful.
It is not for any soul to die except by the permission of Allah, except by the first time; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him the reward of this world; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him the reward of the Hereafter.
How many a prophet fought in the way of those who were fought in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken. And Allah loves those who are steadfast.
They only say, "Our Lord, our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses, and forgive us our sins, and help us against the unbelievers."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world, and the reward of the Hereafter; and Allah loveth those who do good.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will become losers.
Nay, Allah is your Guardian, and He is the best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because of what they associate with Him, having no authority over Allah. Their abode is the Fire, and the evil abode is the evil.
And Allah has promised you the truth, that you may be among those who have passed away in the matter of Allah, so that you may judge in the state of the desert, and kill you much of what you have done, and do not obey the matter of the matter; and if you are to kill you, you would have been better in the life of this world. But if you have been given to you, He has made it a great reward for you. And Allah has forgiven the believers.
And when you were fleeing, there was no blame on you, and when you were calling to the enemy, and the Messenger was calling to you, so that you might not grieve for it, and you will not grieve in what befell you. God is Aware of what you do.
Then He made them a group of you, and made them a party of the people, and He made them a party of the people, and they said, "This is what we have been doing." Say, "You will not be able to be pleased with us." But they will be pleased in the heat, and they will not be able to see it. Their hearts are greater than God, so that they may be pleased with it. The hearts of them is greater than what you have been given. God knows what you do not know. God knows what is in the hearts of the hearts.
Those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met, they will have made their own hands to slip on the way of Satan. But Allah has pardoned them. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
O you who have believed! Do not be like those who disbelieve in the way of their brothers, who would have followed the people in the land, until they had been left in the land. They will say, "Had they been slain, we would not have been killed." Their hearts will have been sealed in the hearts of God. God gives life and causes death to life. God is Seeing of what you do.
And if you are slain in the way of Allah, or die, and forgiveness of Allah, forgiveness of forgiveness, forgiveness.
And if you die or die, you will be gathered to God.
It is because of the mercy of Allah, that you may be gentle to them; and if you were gentle to them, they would have dispersed you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them with forgiveness. But when they turn away, then put your trust in Allah. God loves those who trust.
If Allah supports you, none can overcome you, but if He forsakes you, who can help you, and who is more worthy than he who believed?
It is not for any Prophet to be treacherous, and whoever defrauds has decreed, he will be on his own soul, and he will be paid back on the Day of Resurrection, every soul will be paid back for what he has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah, he is he who is laden with the wrath of Allah, and his refuge is Hell, and he is the homecoming?
They are in ranks in Allah, and Allah is Seeing of what they do.
Indeed, Allah has conferred the believers to the believers when they recite to them the revelations of Allah, to recite His revelations to them, and to teach them the Book and wisdom, and in the Book they had been given manifest error.
Why, when you have befallen you, you would have befallen you twice, and you said, "What is the matter?" Say, "It is from your own selves. God has power over all things.
On the day when the two armies clashed, the two armies met by the permission of God, and that He might test the believers.
And that He might know the hypocrites, and say, "Come to those who fight in the way of Allah," they say, "Had we been given us, we would have been left in the way of God." They will have been nearer to disbelief, and they would say, "We have been given to the believers." Their hearts have been sealed with their hearts. God knows what they conceal.
Those who were left weak will say to those who stayed behind, "Had they listened to us, they would not have been killed." Say, "Then bring death, if you are truthful."
Think not those who are slain in the way of Allah, but they are dead, and they are in their Lord a generous provision.
They rejoice in what God has given them of His grace, and they rejoice in what they have been given. They shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the bounty of Allah and His bounty, and Allah does not reward the wages of the believers.
Those who responded to the Prophet of the Prophet and the believers, so that the Messenger has come to them from Allah, it is they who shall have a great reward and a great reward.
Those who were arrogant will say to those who were arrogant, "This is a army which you fear, so fear them, and fear them." They said, "God is sufficient for us."
So they returned upon Allah’s grace and His grace, and they had not touched them, but they followed the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is dispenser of mighty grace.
It is only Satan who frightens you to his friends, so do not fear them, lest you fear Me, so fear Me.
And let not those grieve those who die, that they will not be able to harm them. Allah will not give them any share in the life of this world, but they will have a great punishment.
As for those who buy disbelief in the price of the believers, they will not harm them in the least, and for them is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that We shall give them respite for their own souls, but We shall give them respite for their sins, and theirs is a disgraceful punishment.
Allah will not leave the believers in the state of the believers, and He has made the hearts of those who believe in their hearts, and they will not believe in the Unseen. And Allah chooses His messengers with His servants whom He chooses. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and believe in Allah and His Messengers, and fear Allah, and a great reward.
And let not those who covetously withhold of Allah's bounty, that He has given them of His grace, it is not for them to be seen of them, and they shall be encircled on the necks on the Day of Resurrection, and their necks will be tied to their necks. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Indeed Allah has heard the statement of those who say, ‘God is poor.” And they say, ‘We are rich,’ and they are rich, and We will say to them, “Taste the punishment of the Fire.”
This is because of what your hands have sent before, and Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say, "We have believed in God, that we should not believe in it until we have come to you." Say, "I have come to you with clear signs before me." Say, "Have you come to me with what you were promised?" Then you will come to them with knowledge, and say, "You were not truthful."
But if they belie you, the apostles were sent before you, clear proofs, evidences, evidences, the Book of Enlightenment.
Every soul will taste death, and you will be paid back to your soul. On the Day of Resurrection, he will be paid back to his Lord, and he will be admitted into the Fire, and the life of this world is nothing but the wares of delusion.
You will surely be tested with your possessions and your lives, and the People of the Book, and those who were before you, and those who were given the Scripture before you, and those who do not believe in the way of Allah, and be patient.
And when Allah made a covenant from those who were given the Book, that they may make it clear to you, and it is not for them to hide it, and it is they who cast it back, and it is a bargain that they bought it. Vile is the bargain for what they were doing.
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and do not believe in what they have done, they will not be able to frustrate them. A painful punishment awaits them.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over all things.
Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, there are signs for the people of understanding.
Those who remember Allah standing, sitting and standing, and in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and they say, "Our Lord! You have not created this, so that they may understand us. Glory be to You, for the punishment of the Fire."
"Our Lord! Whomever You have made the Fire enter the Fire, there is no helpers in the Fire, and there is no helpers for them."
Our Lord, we have heard the crier calling to faith, so believe in your Lord." They said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and forgive us our misdeeds, and make us die in the righteous."
Our Lord! Grant us what Thou hast promised us with Thy apostles, and humiliate us not on the Day of Resurrection, surely Thou breakest not the tryst.
Then, when they will be returned to their Lord, "My Lord has made no good to you." But he will be one of them, and you will find the love of their wealth, and those who are arrogant and the children of the Sacred Mosque will be made to them, and those who are arrogant will be admitted to Paradise, and they will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow. God is pleased with them.
Do not be deceived by the unbelievers, the unbelievers,
This is a brief enjoyment; then their abode is hell, and it is an evil destination.
But as for those who fear their Lord, they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. This is the gift of Allah which is with them. And Allah is with the righteous.
And those who have been given the Book before the People of the Book, and in what was revealed to you, and what has been sent down to them, those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, that they may have a small price, for their Lord is their reward, and Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who have believed, be steadfast and steadfast, and be steadfast in the way of Allah, and fear Allah, so that you may succeed.
O mankind! Fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul, who created you from a single soul, and created from the ship, and created the men, and the men, and the blood, and those who are with you. And fear Allah, and fear that Allah is over all things.
And give to the orphans their property, and do not exchange the good of what they have done, and do not consume it with their property. Indeed, it is a great sin.
And if you fear that you do not fear the orphan and the orphan, then marry one another in the two manner, and if you do not marry any one of them, then do not be able to marry them, nor do you fear one another, and do not be one of those who do right. This is a promise binding upon you.
And give the women to their wives, and give them their bridal good, and if you do not give it to a good thing, it will be a gift of it, and you shall be content.
And do not spend the property of those who have been given the wealth of Allah, for which He has provided you for you, and clothe them, and clothe them, and speak to those who speak.
And let the near age of the age of the near age, until they are mature, until they have reached their age, and give them their share, and do not give them back to them, and give them their share, and give not to the poor. And if he is to give him a good thing, he shall not be able to speak it. And give him your share, and bear your duty to Allah; Allah is All-Reckoner.
There is a share in the parents and the near men, and the relatives, and the relatives, and the needy, and the traveller, and those who are near, whether it be written, or a small share.
And when the division of the division and the near, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and speak to them honourable words.
And let those who are concerned for their wives, who will not be able to be afraid of their wives, and they fear that they should fear Allah, and speak the right course.
Indeed, those who devour the wealth of orphans, and devour their bellies, fill it into fire, and they shall roast in it.
It is not for you to take a share of your wives, but the king has come to you, and the one who has made a share of his own relatives. And it is not for the poor to the needy, and the needy, and the orphans, and the needy, and the orphans, and the needy, and the traveller; and if it is a good thing, he will not be able to give them a way; and if it is to be given to the poor, he will not be able to give you a thing. This is the matter of your Lord, so that you may give them a sign, and if you are a transgressing thing, it will be a great sin.
It is not for you to take your wives to your wives, except that you have no right to whom you have no right, unless they have no right, unless they have not touched them, unless they have not yet touched them, and then have not touched them, he shall have no right to them, nor shall he be able to speak to him, unless they are a man of marriage, and if they are a marriage of marriage, he shall have a share of what he has made to them. And if they are the marriage of the marriage, he shall have a share of what he has given them, and if it is a good thing, he shall be in the right hand. And Allah is All-forgiving and All-knowing.
These are the limits of Allah, and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the supreme triumph.
And whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, and transgresses, and transgresses against him, he shall be admitted into the Fire, wherein he will abide eternally.
As for those who commit illegal sexual intercourse, their wives are a witness to you, if they testify to one another, then if they witness the witnesses, confine them to their houses until death takes them to death.
And those among you who are guilty of adultery, then punish them, then if they repent, then repent, and reform; surely Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
The repentance of those who repent and do evil deeds, it will be for those who repent, and then repent to Him, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.
It is not for those who do evil, and when death comes to them, he says, "I repent," and when they die, he will have a painful punishment.
O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to take your wives to your own women, and do not give them a part of what they have given them, and do not kill them, lest they have reached them, and do not take a part of what they have given them. And if you dislike them, it is better for you.
And if you desire to take a wife from the wife of the woman, then do not make it back to you, and do not take it back to you. Would you take it back, and it is a manifest sin?
How can you take it back, when you have taken a covenant with your own people, and you have taken a solemn pledge with you?
And do not marry your wives with your wives, except the marriage of marriage. Indeed, it is an evil thing, and an evil sin.
(Muhammad), you will find your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your mother, and your wives, and the orphans, and the women, and the women, and the women, and the women, and the women, and the women, and the women, and the other, and the other, and the captive, and the women, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the hair to come to you, that you may not be able to be able to mention it. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And those of you who have made a share of what they have made to you, and do not have any means of what you have forbidden them, except what you have forbidden, except what you have forbidden, except what you have been forbidden. And do not kill them until they have made a share of the marriage. And when they give a share of what they have earned, they will not be blamed. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
And those who do not believe in the way of the believing men and the believing women, and the believing women, and the believing women, and the women, and the women, and the women, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right (of marriage). This is for those who do good, and it is not for them to give it to the sin of the marriage, and if you fear it, he shall be better for them. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allah has made plain to you what you have been mentioned, and to guide you in the ways of those before you. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.
And Allah will forgive you of His mercy, and follow those who follow their lusts, lest you are averse.
Allah wants to lighten for you, and the human being created.
Believers, do not consume the property of your property, except the trade of mutual consent, and do not kill your people, lest it is a trade of mutual consent. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And whoever does evil, We shall make him taste a evil deed, and he shall be admitted into the Fire; and Allah is easy with what they do.
If you avoid the major sins, We will surely expiate your sins, and admit you to a great entrance.
Do not be like those who have preferred others in preference to God. They will have a share of what they have earned, and they have earned for what they have earned, and have no share of what they have earned, and ask forgiveness from God. God is All-aware of everything.
And We have made heirs for what is in the parents and the near, and to what is before him, and to those whom you have made a covenant, and to whom you have no right, and Allah is witness over everything.
Those are they who are among the believing women who are in the same of their own hands, and Allah has preferred them to excel them, and they are not in the sight of Allah, and the seal of their hearts, and those who fear their hearts, and those who guard their duty to Allah, so that they may fear them; and if you fear them, they are in their own hands; and if you obey them, they are the enemy of them; and Allah is All-mighty, All-mighty.
And if you fear a breach between them and his wife, then let her arbiter between the two, and let her arbiter between her. And if they reconcile reconciliation, Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Worship Allah, and ascribe no partner to Him, and to parents, and to the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the neighbor, and the near neighbor, and the neighbor of kin, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer.
Those who are niggardly, and bid the people to be stingy, and spend from what God has given them of His bounty; and for those who are faithless, We have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful punishment.
And those who spend their wealth in the way of God, and do not believe in the Day of Judgment, nor be the ones who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and he who is a companion, he is a companion.
And what is it that they had been for them, and that they believe in Allah and the Last Day, He will give them out of what they have earned, and Allah is well-knowing.
Allah does not commit a atom's weight of injustice, and if it is a good deed, He doubleth it and has a great reward.
How will it be, when We bring a witness from each of them, and We bring you a witness against those who testify.
On that Day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth will be leveled with them, and they will not be able to hide anything.
O you who have believed, do not pray to prayer when you are drunk, nor do you speak to the day when you are travelling in the way of Allah. Whether you are travelling, you will not be able to spend you until you have bathed, or you are travelling in the way of the needy, and if you are travelling in the sky, or a traveler, and then you will be travelling in the way of the fire, and be wary of your own hands, and be wary of your own hands, and Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Hast thou not regarded those who were given the Book purchasing a portion of the Book purchasing error?
And Allah knows best what you are in variance, and Allah is sufficient as a guardian.
Those of the people who were given the Book, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and those who followed them, and they say, ‘This is with us”; and when they come to them, they say, ‘This is a matter.’ Their punishment is greater than the fire, and the punishment of God is greater than them, and they will not believe.
O People of the Book! Believe in what We have sent down to you, confirming what is before you, and do not confound them with their faces, until they were seized by the curse of the Sabbath; and the command of Allah is true.
Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives whomever He wills, and forgives whomever He wills, and he has fabricated a great sin.
Have you not regarded those who claim themselves to be purified? God purifies whomever He wills, and they will not be wronged.
What, do they invent a lie against Allah? This is a manifest sin.
Hast thou not regarded those who have been given the Book who have been given to the People of the Book and those who disbelieve, those who disbelieve, those who disbelieve, they are the believers.
They are the ones whom God has cursed, and whomever Allah curses, there will be no helper.
Or have they a share in the kingdom?
Or do they envy the people who have been given the favor of Allah, that He has bestowed upon them His grace? And We gave them the Book and wisdom, and a mighty kingdom.
Some of them believed in the Book, and some of them believed, and some of them are the fire.
Those who disbelieve in Our signs, We shall scorch them into a Fire, as often as their skins are cooked, and We shall replace them with their skins. Surely God is All-mighty, All-wise.
As for those who believe and do good works, We shall admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, and for them there will be purified spouses.
Surely Allah commands you to maintain the owners of your religion, and when you judge between them, judge between them equitably, and judge with justice. God is All-hearing and All-seeing.
O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not dispute with those who dispute with you, but if you dispute in the matter of Allah, then believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is better for you and the best outcome.
Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what was sent down before you, and what was sent down before you, and they have been commanded to judge with one another, and they are commanded to fall away over them?
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down, and the Messenger," they say, "Do not obey the hypocrites," they are hypocrites.
How how will it be, when their misfortune befalls them, and what smote them, because of what their hands have sent before, and they say, "We have no power to do good than Allah."
Those are their hearts in whose hearts Allah knows what is in their hearts, so let them admonish them, and speak them to their words, and speak to them words.
We did not send any messenger to any Prophet, but they were obeyed by the command of Allah. If they had been wronged, they would have been wronged, and when they had been given to the Messenger, they would have taken forgiveness from God, and forgiveness for forgiveness.
But those who do not believe in your Lord will judge between you concerning the disputes of your Lord, so that you may judge between them, and let them be pleased in their disputes.
And if We had sent down to them (O Muhammad SAW), "Kill your wives or your women," they would not have done it, but they would not have done it, but it would have been better for them, but they would have been better than it.
And We shall have given them a great reward from Us.
And guided them to a straight path.
And those who obeys Allah and His Messenger, those who are with those who are with them, the martyrs, the martyrs, the martyrs, the righteous, the martyrs, the righteous, and the righteous.
This is the bounty of Allah, and Allah is ever aware of all things.
O you who believe! Take your precautions, and go forth in detachments, or go forth in detachments.
There is some among you who lag behind, and if a misfortune befalls you, he says, "I have been given to God that I was not present with them."
And if a favor from Allah from you comes to you, he would have been able to help you, and if it was said to them, "Oh, I am with you."
So let those who sell the life of the life of this world for those who fight in the life of this world, and whoever fights in the way of Allah, We shall give him a great reward in the Hereafter, nor shall We reward him.
And what is the matter with you that you fight in the way of Allah, and the weak, and women, and the men, and the women, "Our Lord! Liberate us from this town, a group of us who are a enemy from our Lord, and appoint for us a helper from Yourself, and appoint for us a helper from Yourself."
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and the unbelievers fight in the way of Allah. So fight in the way of Satan. Indeed, the guile of Satan is ever feeble.
Hast thou not regarded those who went away from the way of their Lord, and when they were to establish the prayer, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the poor, and the poor, who would say, "Our Lord! If You give us a respite, they would not have taken a life of this life." But they will say, "This is the reward of Allah." This is the reward of those who do good, and the Hereafter will be given to those who do not believe.
Wherever you die, you will find it to die, and if you are pleased with you, they will say, "This is from Allah." But if a misfortune befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah." Say, "It is with Allah." But what is with them is a matter from those who understand it?
Whatever good befalls you is from Allah, and whatever befalls you, it is evil for you, and We have sent down to you a messenger, and Allah suffices as a witness.
Those who obey the Messenger, and whoever obeys him, then surely he has been sent down to thee, We have not sent over you a watcher.
They say, "We have listened to their presence," but when they turn away, they say, "Indeed, each of them is planning." But those who conspire the secret of their nocturnal plots, their plots is determined, so that they may keep their trust in Allah, and put your trust in Allah. God is sufficient as a guardian.
Do they not ponder the Qur'an? Had it not been for any other than Allah, they would surely have been able to differ in it.
And when it comes to them, they will not reach it, but it is they who have come to them, and they had believed in the Book, and when they had come to them, they would have been better than them. But when they had been given the knowledge of Allah, it would have been better for them, but they would have followed a few of the believers.
So fight in the way of Allah, for those who believe in the way of Allah, and do not follow the believers, for the believers may be the believers, and Allah is Stronger in Might, the Owner.
Whoever intercedes with a good deed shall have a share of his own soul, and whoever intercedes with a good deed, he shall be a share of his own seed, and Allah has power over all things.
And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet with a greeting better than it, or be patient. God is with all things.
Allah, there is no god but He. He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection, there is no doubt on Him, and He is the truthful of the truthful.
What is the matter with you in the two parties, when you are in the two parties, and Allah has made ready for them what they have earned, so that Allah might show you those whom you have earned? Whomever Allah leads astray, you will not find for him any way.
They wish that you should disbelieve in those who disbelieve, so that they may be one of them. So do not follow them until they emigrate in the way of Allah; and if they turn away, then let them kill them, and kill them wherever they find the way of Allah, and do not make them a friend.
Except those who have taken a covenant between the people of the Book, or their hearts, or their brothers, or their brothers, or their brothers, or their hearts, or their own brothers. Had they not been pleased, they would have been pleased in the way of Allah. Had Allah willed, He would have given you power. So fight against them, and do not obey them.
You will find for you some of that which they have been secure, and they will not be able to be safe from the way of their Lord, and they will not be able to go away from them, but they will not be able to do them. And if they turn away, they shall be in the sight of the people. And when they turn away, kill them, and kill them wherever you kill them, and kill them with a clear warrant.
The believers will not be followed except the one who follows the truth, and the one who follows his faith. The one who believes in his Lord is the same one who believes in his Lord. The one who believes in his Lord is the same one who believes in his Lord, and he who follows the commands of his Lord, it is he who turns to his own accord, and whoever is forced by his own accord, he shall be forced by his own accord, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.
As for those who do good, he will be admitted into the Fire of Hell, and he will abide therein forever, and Allah has cursed him and has prepared for him a terrible punishment.
O you who have believed, when you find the way of Allah in the way of Allah, you will not be able to say to those who are near in the life of the life of this world, and say, "You will not be able to give you a good life." God has given you abundant spoils, so that you may be pleased in the life of this world. But Allah has conferred His favour for you, so that you may understand.
The believers are not equal to those who are steadfast in the way of Allah, and those who strive with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah, and those who strive with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah; and those who strive with the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Such is the reward of those who strive with Allah, and the reward of Allah is better.
Ranks from Him and forgiveness, and Allah is forgiving and merciful.
Indeed, those who were unjust to the wrongdoers say to the angels, "What is the matter of you?" They will say, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say, "Was it not for God's earth to cause you to emigrate in the earth?" Their abode is Hell, and an evil destination!
Except for those who are weak and men and children, and they are not able to find a way to them.
They will have forgiveness for God. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
Whoever emigrates in the way of Allah will be in the land, and the earth, and the earth, and the wayfarer, and those who go back in the way of Allah, and he who goes back to his home, his wage will come to him. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
And when you are journeying in the land, there will be no blame on you if you shorten the day of the earth, and fear that you may be a sin for those who fear the truth. Indeed, Allah is the enemy of the disbelievers.
And when you turn away, they will find your prayer, and when you stand at the prayer, they stand to your prayer, and do not approach your prayer; but if you fear them, they will not be able to harm you. But if you do not fear that you have been able to do the means of the Holy Mosque, it is only for you to prevent you from the way of your Lord. But God has prepared a great punishment for you. He has prepared for the unbelievers a painful punishment.
And when you have finished the prayer, remember Allah, standing, sitting, and reclining on your sides. And when you are secure, perform the prayer, and pay the obligatory obligatory obligatory times.
And do not slacken in the pursuit of the enemy. If you are suffering, you are aching of suffering, but you will not be able to harm them. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book with what is revealed to you, so that you judge between them, and do not judge by the command of Allah.
And ask forgiveness of God; surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And do not plead with behalf of those who do not betray them. Indeed Allah does not love the sinful.
They do not hide from Allah, and when they hide their souls, they cannot hide themselves by God. He knows whatever they do, and He knows whatever they do.
This is because you have argued in the life of this world in this world, but who will argue in their behalf in the life of the world, and who will have their defender from Allah?
And whoever does evil or wrongs, and does evil, then Allah will forgive him, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whosoever earns sin, he earnoth himself, and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And he who commits a mistake or a sin, and then blames it with a innocent person, he is a sin and a manifest sin.
Were it not for the grace of Allah upon you, He would have given you a party of His mercy, but they would not mislead you, but they would not harm them, but they have been given to you, and the Book has been revealed to you. And Allah has given you the Book and wisdom, and He is the best of grace.
There is no blame in what is in their breasts, or he who is better, or he who is niggardly, and who is better in charity, and he who does good, seeking the pleasure of Allah, We shall give him a great reward.
And whoever opposes the Messenger after he has come to him, and follows the way of his Lord, he shall be made to enter the way of his deeds, and We shall roast him for a evil destination.
Allah does not forgive the sins of considering partners to Him, and He forgives whomever He wills, and forgives whomever He wills, and he is far astray.
Those whom they invoke besides Him, they call to the idols, and they are the companion of Satan.
God has cursed them, and they said: "I shall take a portion of the children of the Most Gracious."
And I will lead them astray, and I will arouse them to slit the ears of cattle, and I will tell them the ears of cattle, and I will tell them that they may alter the creation of God. Whosoever takes Satan as a patron, he is a loser.
Satan promises them and arouses of them; and Satan promises them not, but he promises them.
These will be the Fire, and they will find no escape from it.
But those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. The promise of Allah is true.
It is not your fancies nor the fancies of the People of the Book. Whosoever does evil will be recompensed for his own soul, and none will find no protector besides Allah.
And whoever does good deeds, whether male or female, and he who is a believer, shall enter Paradise, and will not be wronged in the least.
And who is more better than he who submits his face to Allah, and is a doer of good, and a man who follows the right religion, and follows the creed of Abraham? And he was a friend.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and Allah is Able to do all things.
They ask you concerning the spoils of their daughters. Say, "The spoils of God is with you. Those who have been given the Book will be given to you. Do not kill them, and do not be responsible for them. Those who have been given the Book will be given to you, and the relatives, and the wayfarer, and what you do.
And if any woman fears a woman, he shall not be blamed, or let peace between her, and he is a sin between them; and if they are angry, it is better for them; and if you are godfearing, it is better for them; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
You will not be able to be equitable between your wives, and you will not be able to be able to be able to do so. If you do not do so, it is suspended between them. But if you are righteous, then fear that Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
But if they separate, Allah will enrich them of His grace. God is All-Embracing, All-Wise.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to those who have been given the Book before you. So fear Allah, and do not fear Him. And if you disbelieve, then know that God is the All-sufficient, the All-laudable.
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah is sufficient as a guardian.
If He wills, He can take you away, O men, and bring others a single creation. God is powerful over all things.
Whoever desires the reward of this world, he is the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
O you who believe! Be maintainers of justice and witnesses, or be your parents, or your parents, or your parents, or your parents, or your relatives. Whether any one is rich than him, do not follow one another, or do not follow the testimony. God knows what you do.
O you who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book which has been sent down to him, and what has been sent down to him, and the Gospel, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Last Day, and the Last Day.
Those who believe, then believe, then believe, then believe, and then disbelieved, then again, then again, and then again, Allah will not forgive them.
Give news to the hypocrites that they may be a painful punishment.
Those who take the unbelievers for friends instead of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism). Do they seek them to hasten in the way of Allah? How honour is the power of honour.
And Allah has sent down the Book for those who disbelieve, so that you may see the signs of those who disbelieve, until they engage not until they engage until they engage in their midst. And Allah knoweth the hypocrites. And Allah is the Fire of the Fire.
Those who wait upon you, [O Muhammad], if Allah grants victory to you, [O Muhammad], "Were we not with you?" But if the disbelievers had come to you, they say, "Did we not say to you," and do not believe in the believers?" But God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will judge between the believers.
The hypocrites are not ashamed of God, but Allah is deceiving them. And when they pray to prayer, they stand in prayer, and when the prayer are mentioned, they are not aware.
They are the ones who are in the right side of the right side, and they will not go astray. Whomever Allah leads astray, he will not find for him any way.
O you who have believed! Do not befriend those who have believed and do not believe in God. Would you judge?
The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire, and you will find no helper.
Except those who repent, and hold fast to the right path, and hold fast to Allah, and hold fast to Allah. These are the believers, and Allah will give the believers a great reward.
What is the matter with you, if you believe in Allah and His mercy? And Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Allah does not like any soul who earns a evil deed, and he is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.

Those who believe in Allah and His messengers, and say, "We believe in God and His messengers," they say, "We believe in some another," and say, "We believe in some another," and in the way of some other believers.
They are the ones who deny the truth, and have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful punishment.
And those who believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not differentiate between them, they shall have their reward, and Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
The People of the Book ask you to bring down to them a Book from heaven. They said, "We have not been able to have been able." They said, "Show us," and they said, "We have been worshipping." Their thunderbolt came to them with clear proofs, but they took the calf clear to them, and gave them clear authority.
And We made the Mount above them above them, and We sent down upon them the mount of the Mount, and We said to them, "Enter the gate bowing to the gate," and they said, "We took the Sabbath on the Sabbath, and it was not for the wrongdoers."
So their breaking their covenant, and their covenant, and their killing of the prophets, and their killing of their own souls, and their saying, "Our hearts are sealed by God." So Allah has sealed their hearts, so they will not believe.
And their disbelief came to them from the truth, and a monstrous calumny.
And they said, “The Messiah, the son of Mary, the son of Mary, the son of Mary.” They did not kill him, but they did not kill him, but they have disputed in the matter of their Lord, and they differ in it, but they have no knowledge.
But Allah raised him up to Himself, and Allah is All-mighty, All-wise.
And there is not a party of the People of the Book save him to believe in his death, and on the Day of Resurrection, he will be among those who bear witness on Us.
As for those who were Jews, they prohibited their homes, and made unlawful for the good things which We had prohibited for them, and from the way of Allah, they would surely have been rebellious.
And for their taking usury, that they had been forbidden, and because they were prohibited, their consuming men, and their devouring of their own people. For them We have prepared a painful punishment.
But those of them who believe in the Book, and believe in what has been sent down to you, and what was sent down before you, and the establishers of prayer and the givers of the believers, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, We shall give them a great reward.
We have revealed to you what was revealed to Noah, and We revealed to Noah, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Isaac, Jacob, Isaac, Jacob, the Tribes, Job, Jonah, Job, Jonah, and Aaron, and We gave the Psalms to the Psalms.
And indeed, We have mentioned to you some of what We have related to you, and We have not related to you of the matter, and Allah spoke to him a messenger.
We sent glad tidings to the Prophet and the glad tidings, so that there may be no one to bring them any other than God. God is Majestic and All-wise.
So Allah bears witness to what He has sent down to you, and He has sent down to you what is sent down to you, and the angels is witness, and Allah suffices as a witness.
Indeed, those who disbelieve, and hinder others from the way of Allah, are indeed far astray.
Those who disbelieve, and do wrong, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to any way.
Except the path of Hell, wherein they will abide forever. This is easy for Allah.
O mankind! The Messenger has come to you from your Lord, so believe in it. And if you disbelieve, it is better for you. And if you disbelieve, God is All-knowing and All-wise.
O People of the Book, do not make the covenant of your Lord, the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, ‘Do not worship Allah.’ And it is not for your mother, but Allah has taken down the Messiah. There is no god but He. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.
The Messiah will not be able to serve God, nor the angels, nor the angels, and the angels, and the angels, who are arrogant.
But as for those who believe and do good works, He will give them their wages in full, and will increase them with His grace. They will have a painful punishment.
O mankind! Indeed there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and We sent down to you a clear light.
So those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them to His mercy, and He will admit them to His mercy, and will guide them to a straight path.
They ask you about the Prophet. Say: 'The spoils of Allah will be for you, and you will not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do." And if they go back, he will be two than his parents, and if they are two-kin, he will be two-doers, and if one of them is two than his own accord, he will not be able to go back to one another, and if one of them is two than his own accord, he will be made to go on his own accord. God knows everything.
O you who have believed, fulfil your obligations and the flesh of the lawful and the animals. This is not lawful for you to hunt to the game of the game of the game of the pilgrimage. Thus does you give the pilgrimage to the pilgrimage. God does not appoint the law of the treacherous.
O you who have believed, do not be in the way of Allah, and the needy and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the traveller, and the needy, and the traveller, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the one who is the needy, and the wayfarer, and the one who does not fear the sin of one another, and the sin of one another, and the sin of one another, so that he may be one of those who fear the truth, and fear Allah and His Noble Messenger.
It is He who has made you the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, the flesh of the animals, and the flesh of the flesh of the animals, and the flesh of the flesh of the animals, and the flesh of the flesh of the animals, and the flesh of the animals, and the flesh of Jacob, and that you may not be able to change the way of those who have been given to the command of Allah. That is the command of those who do good, so that they may be guided.
They ask you concerning what is lawful, and say, "This is lawful and lawful, and what is lawful, and what is lawful, and what has been given to you. Eat of what God has given you, and do not eat what you have been commanded, and fear God, and fear God. Indeed Allah is swift in retribution.’
This is lawful for you in the Torah, and the Gospel, and for the people of the Book, and for the people of the Book, and for those who were given the Book, and those who were given the Book before you, and those who were given the Book before it, nor do they fear that it is not for those who have been given the Book. But the wrong-doers are in the sight of Allah, and the Hereafter.
O you who have believed! When you pray to the prayer of prayer, then be your prayer, and when you are near to your own selves, you will not be able to be able to take your hands from your side, and you will not be able to remove the impurity of your Lord, and you will not be able to remove the impurity of your Lord. And if you are secure, you will be in your hands, and have made the impurity of the poor, so that you may be mindful of it. And remember Allah, and give you good advice. He has made lawful to you that you may be grateful.
And remember the favor of Allah with His favor which He has sent upon you, and said, "We hear and we obey." And fear Allah. Indeed Allah is Knowing of what is in the breasts.
O you who believe! Be upright and witnesses with Allah, and let not the hatred of your witnesses be to you, lest you speak to one another, and do not follow the testimony. Indeed Allah is well aware of what you do.

And those who deny the truth and deny Our signs, these are the inmates of the Fire.
O you who have believed! Remember the favor of Allah upon you, when your people were upon you, but He withheld their hands over you, and restrained their hands from your own hands, and fear Allah, and rely in the believers.
And Allah made a covenant for the Children of Israel, and We said: 'I am with you, and I am with you.' And when they expend the prayer, they pay alms, and the poor-rate, and those who believe in the prayer and pay the poor-rate, and believe in Allah and the Last Day; and if ye repent, He will admit you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, and will not guide him who hath strayed from the way of the Beneficent.
So for their breaking their covenant, We cursed them, and their hearts, and We made their hearts a part of their hearts, and they have forgotten the good, so that they should not be able to change the way of a part of what they have done, and they would not cease to be a part of what they have done. And pardon them, and forgive them; surely Allah loves the righteous.
And as for those who say, "We are Christians," so they forgot them, but they forgot a part of what We have given them, and among them is some who have been given enmity, and the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will inform them of what they used to do.
O People of the Book! We have sent down to you a Messenger from among the people of the Book, and overlooking much of what you have been concealing, and overlooking in what has been revealed to you, and a clear Book.
That Allah may guide those who have believed in the way of Allah, and brings them out of darkness from His light, and He guides them from the darkness of the light, and guided them to the straight path.
Indeed, those who disbelieve say, "God has taken a son." Say, "The Messiah is the Messiah, the son of Mary." Say, "The Messiah, the son of Mary, the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is in the heavens and the earth? To Allah belongs all sovereignty, and He is Able to do all things."
The Jews and Christians say, "We are the beloved of God and His beloved." Say, "Why does you not ask your sins for your sins?" He forgives whomever He will, and He punishes whomever He wills, and punishes whomever He wills. To the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, and to Him is the homecoming.
O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, and the Noble Messenger has come to you, so that you may say to them, "Do not give a good news to us, and give glad tidings to the Messenger." But there has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. And Allah has power over all things.
And recall when Moses said to his people, ‘O my people, remember God’s favour upon you when He has made you kings, and made you kings, and made you kings, and did not have any power to be given to Him.”
O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah has assigned for you, and do not turn back to your backs, lest you will be losers."
They said, "O Moses, we shall never enter the first land, and we will never enter it until they go forth."
So those who feared the fear of Allah said, "Enter the gate of Paradise." But when they enter the gate, they will enter it, and said: "O my Lord! Put your trust in Him, if you are believers."
They said: "O Moses, we shall never enter it, but we will be in it. Go your Lord to your Lord, and fight here."
He said, "My Lord, I have no control over myself and my brother, so bear us astray from among the people of the wicked."
He said, “It is the same for them for forty years, so that they may wander in the land, and do not grieve for the people.”
And recite thou to them the story of the two sons of Adam, and when one of them were one of them, and he became one of them. And when he became of them, he said: 'Indeed, the one of them is the enemy of Allah; and Allah does not fear the righteous.”
If you do not kill me, I will take your hand to kill me from your hand, lest I fear that you should be of Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
I will tell you that I should be of your sin, and the sin of your sin, and the inmates of the Fire; this is the recompense of the evildoers.
Then his soul prompted him to kill his brother, and he killed him.
Then Allah sent a crow scratching the corpse of the earth to show him how he was able to hide the corpse of his brother. He said, "Woe to me! Am I not able to see the like of this crow, and I have made my brother as a liar."
That was how We gave the Children of Israel to be a Book for the Children of Israel that he should be slain in the life of the land, nor would he be saved by the murder of a man. We have sent down to mankind a terrible person, and he will be as a man who would be saved by the life of the world. But the apostles came to them with clear proofs, but many of them commit excesses.
The recompense of those who fight God and His Messenger and the earth, and the people of the land, whether the people of the land, or their hands, or their hands, or their hands, or their hands, or their feet, or be banished in their land. For them is a disgraceful punishment.
Except those who repent before you, and know that Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
O you who have believed, fear God, and seek your duty to Him, and seek His mercy, and spend in what you used to do.
Indeed, those who disbelieve, if they are in the earth, and in the earth, it will be done for them, and they will not be accepted by a ransom from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection. For them is a painful punishment.
They will not wish to get out of the Fire, and they will not be able to avert it from the way of Hell.
As for the thief, the thief, and the female, and the carrier of her, they shall be punished by their punishment. God is All-mighty, All-wise.
But whoever repents after he who repents and does righteous deeds, then surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wishes, and punishes whomever He wishes, and Allah has power over all things.
O Prophet, when the hypocrites are grieved, they will not believe in their hearts, and they say, ‘We believe in it,’ and they do not believe in it, and they have believed in the way of God, and it is not for those who believe, and they will say, ‘This is for you.’ And those who do not believe in the way of Allah, it is they who have been given to themselves. And Allah does not love those who do not believe in the life of this world, and they will have a great punishment.
(Muhammad), listen to the people who have been forbidden. If they come to you, they will not be able to harm them. If you turn away from them, they will not harm you, and if you judge between them, judge between them between them. Indeed Allah loves those who judge.
And how can they be to you, when they were given the Book before you, and the Taurat of those who have been given the Book before them? Yet they turn away.
Indeed, We have sent down the Book to the Torah, and the guidance, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Gospel, and it was not for them to fear it. Do not fear My revelations for a paltry price, and do not fear those who disobey God’s revelations. Indeed, Allah does not like the unbelievers.
And We wrote for them, [O Muhammad], the life of the Book, a eye for a eye, a nose for a nose, a nose for a nose, and a nose for a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and whoever forgoes it, then it is for his own soul, and Allah does not like the wrongdoers.
And We gave him the son of Mary, the son of Mary, confirming what was before him, confirming what was before him, confirming what was before him, and the Injeel, and the Injeel, and the Gospel, confirming that which was before him, and a guidance and a admonition for those who guard (against evil).
And let not the People of the Gospel judge according to what Allah has sent down, and that they may judge according to what Allah has sent down, and they are not unjust.
And We have sent down the Book before the People of the Book, so that you may judge between them, and to follow the people of the Book, and follow not the desires of those who have followed them. Had it not been for those who have been given the Book, it would have been made for them. And Allah has given you the gift of what He has given you. Then, if ye return to Allah, He will have given you the good things. Then to Allah is your return, and He will tell you what you used to differ.
And judge between them with what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their vain desires, lest they turn away from them, lest they turn away from them, lest they turn away from the command of Allah. But if they turn away, then know that Allah has made them some of their sins. But many of them are rebellious.
Is it the matter of those who passed away before them? What is the judgement of those who believe in the way of Allah?
O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are allies of one another, and among them is one another. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease, and they say, "We fear lest misfortune may befall us." God will say, "Perhaps a misfortune reaches Allah, He will bring it to a victory, and they will be regretting in their hearts.
And those who believe will say, "Are these the ones who swore their strongest oaths by Allah?" They will say, "We have wasted their deeds, and they will be lost."
O you who have believed, whoever turns away from your Lord, there will be a group of him who believes in Allah and the Last Day, and who strive hard in the way of Allah, and who strive hard for the cause of Allah, and who strive hard, they will have no fear, and fear the way of Allah; He is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
Surely those who believe and obey Allah and His Messenger, and those who establish the prayer, and pay the alms, and pay the obligatory charity.
And whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, and the party of Allah -- surely the party of the mighty.
O you who have believed! Do not befriend those who have been given the Book before you and those who have been given the Book who have been given to those who have been given the Book and those who disbelieve. Fear Allah, if you are believers.
And when they call to prayer, they call to you as a sport and a sport.
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you resent us except that God has sent down to us the Book, and what has been revealed to us, and that we may believe in God and in what we have been doing?"
Say, "Shall I tell you of what is worse than what is worse than Allah? Those who have incurred the curse of God and those whom He has given apes and swine, those who have incurred apes and swine, and those who associate others with Satan, they are the worst of helpers.
And when the angels come to you, they say, "We believe," but when they come to you, they say, "We believe," and Allah knows what they conceal.
You see many of them competing in sin and transgression, and consuming the evil-doers, and what they have been doing.
Why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid them, except what their own hands have been forbidden? Evil is what they have been doing.
And the hypocrites said, "It is from your Lord. It is He who has sent down their hands, so that they will stand on the Day of Resurrection. On the Day of Resurrection, those who have been wronged will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection. On the Day of Resurrection, those who have believed in the Day of Resurrection will be resurrected from the necks of the disbelievers and the Day of Resurrection. God does not love the people who are the enemy of the Fire, and He does not love the arrogant.
And if the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We would have remitted their sins, and admitted them to the Gardens of Delight.
And if they had followed the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have consumed from their feet, and from beneath them, and from beneath them; and many of them are evil.
O Prophet! Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not do it, then do not follow them. Indeed, I have conveyed the message from your Lord, and Allah guides not the people who deny the truth.
Say, "O People of the Book, you are not in the religion of the Book, and the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you, and what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord. So do not believe in the disbelief of those who believe, and do not believe.
Those who believe, and the Jews and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, will have no fear, nor will they grieve.
We sent a covenant with the Children of Israel with the Children of Israel, and We sent to them a messenger from which they did not believe, and some of their mouths came to them, and some of them were killed.
They will never see that they were blind and deaf, and deaf and deaf. But God turned astray from them, and turned astray. God is not aware of what they do.
Indeed, those who disbelieve said, "God is the Messiah, the son of Mary." The Messiah said, "O Jesus, worship God, your Lord, your Lord, your Lord, your Lord, and the polytheists, and the one who associate others with Allah, and the abode of Allah, and the abode of Hell, and the abode of the Fire is the Fire.
Those who say, "God has taken a son." There is no god but He. There is no god but He. But those who do not believe, a painful punishment awaits them.
Will they not then repent, and seek forgiveness from God? For God is Oft-forgiving, All-compassionate.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was not a Messenger, nor was a messenger before him, and the mother of the people of Moses, and the other, and the other, and the other. See how We make them clear signs, so that they may see.
Say, "Will you worship God, if you worship Him, and do not have any power to harm you? God is All-hearing and All-knowing."
Say, "O People of the Book, do not follow the religion of the Book, and do not follow the caprices of those who went astray before it." But they went astray from the right path.
Those who disbelieved the people of the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David, and Jesus, son of Mary. They were the people of the truth, and because they were defiantly disobedient.
They did not forbid one another from another, but they were evil.
You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which they have been sent with. Their plots is covered from Allah, and they will be abiders in it.
And if they had believed in Allah and His Messenger, and that which was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends, but most of them are ungodly.
You will find the Jews and the Jews to you in the way of those who believe in the way of the Jews and the Christians, and they say, "We are Christians." That is because they are the ones who say, "We are Christians."
And when they hear what has been sent down to the Prophet, they see the truth overflowing with tears. They say, "Our Lord, we believe in what they have done." They say, "We believe in what we have done."
And what is it that we should not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us, so that we may believe in our Lord?
So Allah rewarded them with Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of the righteous.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, these are the inmates of the Fire.
O you who believe! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like the transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has provided for you, lawful and good, and fear God, for that you may be grateful.
It is not for you to take your oaths with your oaths, nor Allah has made your oaths, lest you have made a share of your parents. This is a matter that you may be able to be able to reach the burden of your Lord. This is a matter that you may be able to reach the burden of your Lord. This is what you have been enjoined by your own oaths, so that you may be a expiation in the wombs of Allah, so that you may be mindful of your oaths, so that you may remember Allah, so that you may remember Allah.
O you who have believed, intoxicants and gambling, and the divining-arrows, and the divining, and the divining arrows, so that you may be godfearing.
Satan wants to make you enmity and gambling, and to hinder you from the way of God and the men and the people who are the prayer. Will you not then believe?
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then know that Our Messenger is only to communicate the message.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, they will not be wronged for the believers, nor will they believe, and do good deeds, and believe, and do good deeds, and believe, and do good deeds, and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who have believed, Allah will test you with a game that is within your hands, so that you may know what Allah has given you, so that Allah may know those who fear Him, so that he may be a painful punishment.
O you who have believed, you will not be able to approach the day when you are in the journey, and you will not be able to be able to make the poor to the needy, unless you are one of the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the traveller, and the needy, and the traveller. Whoever commits his duty to his own soul, he will be in his sin. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
Lawful to you is the game of the sea and the sea, and the provision of the land, and for the travellers, and for the travellers, and for the travellers, and for the travellers. And fear Allah, and fear that you shall be gathered to Him.
Allah has made the Ka'bah (the Ka'bah), the Sacred House (the Ka'bah (Makkah), the Ka'bah, the Ka'bah (Makkah), the Ka'bah (the Ka'bah (Makkah)], and the sacred month (the Ka'bah (Makkah)], it is that which is in the land, and that it may be that you may know that Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and the earth, and Allah knoweth all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
There is no duty to the Prophet, but Allah knows what you conceal and what you conceal.
Say, "The good and the good are not equal to those who do good, so that you may be pleased in the way of God, and fear God, so that you may succeed."
O you who have believed, do not ask questions of what you have sent down to you, but if they were sent down to you, they will not be able to ask you. But if you ask the Qur'an, they will be responsible with what is revealed to you. God is forgiving and forbearing.
The people of your people had come to you, but they disbelieved.
Allah has not made a example for those who do not have any sanctity of the Sacred Mosque, except as a camel, or a camel of false sanctity, but the unbelievers fabricate lies against Allah, and most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down," they say, "We will follow what our fathers have made before." They will say, "It is our fathers." Even though their fathers had no knowledge, nor did they understand.
O you who have believed, do not go astray on the way of your own souls, but you will not be able to harm you. To Allah you will be returned. To Him you will be returned.
O you who have believed, when you are driven back to the journey, you will not be able to go forth in the company of those who are left in the land, and you will not be able to go back to you in the land, unless you are truthful in the land. And if they are to go back, he will say to those who say, "This is a obligation for us," and say, "This is a obligation for us." And whoever fulfills the testimony of Allah, they will surely say, "We shall surely be among the wrongdoers."
But if it is discovered that they are guilty of the sin of the two-doers, the two among them will be two than them, and the nearest among them will be two than them, and they say, "Our testimony is truer than Allah, and we have not transgressed."
This is because they should not bear testimony with a witness, or that they may bear testimony with their oaths, and fear not that which is right, and fear Allah, and be careful of the limits.
On the Day when He will raise them with His Messengers, saying, "We have heard what is in the unseen."
And when Jesus son of Mary said to the son of Mary, 'Give him the son of your son, and your mother, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and I shall make it the first time, and I shall not make the first one of the people of the Book, and I shall make it a sign for the people of the Book, and I shall make it a sign for the people of the Book.' And when it came to you, he said: 'I have made the Children of Israel to come to you, and I shall bring you a sign, and those who reject the signs of the Prophets, and the apostles.'
And when I inspired the disciples with the disciples, they believe in Me, and said: Believe in Me, and bear witness that we bear witness.
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, will your Lord send down to us a table from heaven?" He said, "Fear God, if you are believers."
They said, "We will bring us out of our hearts, and that our hearts may be reassured in the truth, and that we may be witnesses."
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "O Jesus, our Lord has sent down to us a table from heaven, and a sign for us, and a sign for us, and a sign for us, and a sign for us, and a sign for us, and You are the best of providers."
Allah said, "I am sent down to you, but whoever disbelieves, then I will punish him, and I will punish him in the punishment of the worlds."
And when Allah said to his son, “My son, I have taken a pledge from Allah, so do I not say, ‘‘I am my helpers?’ And it said, ‘I do not know what I do not know that I will be able to be able to be able to do.’ And it is not for the knowledge of the unseen, and I know what you do not know, and I know what you do not know.
I will not associate them with anything except that my Lord has commanded me. Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord, for I have made them a long time, and I have made them a watcher over them, and I have made them a watcher over them, and You are the Witness over all things.
If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say, "This is the Day of which the truthful will be in the sight of God. They will be admitted with gardens wherein streams flow, wherein they will abide forever. God is pleased with them and pleased with them. God is pleased with them.
To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and He has power over everything.
Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness of darkness and light; and those who disbelieve in their Lord are not equal.
It is He Who created you from clay, then brings you a single term, then He has appointed a term before you, and you are truthful.
And He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you reveal and what you disclose.
And there comes not to them a sign from the signs of their Lord, but they turn away therefrom.
And indeed, it has come to them the truth, so they will come to them, so that they may come to them.
Have they not regarded how many generations We have destroyed before them? We destroyed them in the land, which We established them in the sky, and We sent down rain from the sky, and sent down rain from them. Then We destroyed them for their sins, and We destroyed each other.
Had We sent down to you a Book which We have sent down to you, it would have been sent down to them, but they would say, "This is nothing but a obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not a angel been sent down to him?" Had We sent down a angel, the matter would have been decided before them, and they would not have been reprieved.
And had We sent a angel, We would have made him a man, and We have made ready for them that which they have been differing.
And indeed We sent apostles before you, but those who scoffed before them were laughing at them.
Say, "Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who rejected the truth."
Say, "To whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He will gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not believe."
To Him belongs all that is in the night and the day, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Say, "Shall I take a protector other than Allah, Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "To Allah belongs the sustenance of the heavens and the earth, and I am not of those who submit to Him, and I am not of the polytheists."
Say: 'I fear that I should disobey my Lord, the chastisement of a dreadful Day.
On that Day he will redeem him from the Day of Resurrection. That is the manifest triumph.
And if Allah touch you with affliction, none can remove it except Him; and if He touches you, He has power over all things.
And He is the All-mighty, the All-wise, the All-wise.
Say, "I do not claim to associate anything with God, and I do not judge in what I have sent down to me." Say, "I do not know what is revealed to me." Say, "I do not follow any one besides Allah." Say, "I do not worship any other than Allah." Say, "God is a god, and I worship what you worship."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognise it as they recognize their own sons; and those who do not believe in their own souls do not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies His signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not prosper.
On the Day when We shall gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated others with Allah, "Where are your partners whom you used to claim?"
Then they will not be able to say, "Our Lord, we did not have any partners to God, and we were not of those who associate others with Allah."
What, do they invent lies against what they used to invent? They have lost their own souls.
And among them are some who listen to it, but We have placed veils over their hearts, so that they may understand the Qur'an; and if they see the clear signs, they would not believe in it. But if they come to you, they say, "This is nothing but ancient legends." But those who deny the truth say, "This is nothing but ancient legends."
And they turn away from it, and they turn away from it, and they are not aware.
And when you could see them in the Fire, they will say, "Oh, would that we had been sent back to us, and we would not be among the believers."
Nay, but they were brought to their own souls, that they should be brought back to them, and they would be brought back to it, and they were liars.
They say, "There is nothing but our life of this world, and we are not resurrected."
And when you see them, they will have been stationed with their Lord, and they will say: "Is it not that our Lord?" They will say: "Yes, but our Lord!" He will say: "Then taste the truth, for ye will be requited."
Those who deny the meeting of Allah will have failed on the Hour, and when the Hour comes upon them suddenly, they say, "Alas on what we have been doing." They will bear their burdens on their backs, and they will bear their burdens on their backs. Evil is what they bear!
The life of this world is nothing but a sport and a pastime, and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who do not believe.
Indeed, We know what they say, [O Muhammad], if you do not grieve. Indeed, those who deny the signs of Allah are the wrongdoers.
And indeed were messengers before you, but they were patient, and when they were patient, they would have followed them, and there came to them the words of Allah, and there is no difference for you.
And if they turn away from them, they will not have a ladder to the earth until it is a ladder to the sky, or a ladder for a ladder to the sky; and if they come to you, they would have a ladder in the sky; and Allah guides them, and do not be of the ignorant.
Only those who hear, they are the ones who listen to the truth; and Allah will raise them to the Day of Resurrection.
They say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "God has sent down a sign, but most of them do not know.
There is not a animal on the earth but its bird flies with its wings, but it is a heaviness in the Book. We have neglected the Book in the Book. Their Lord will be gathered to their Lord.
Those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb, in the darkness of the darkness of darkness. Whomever Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills.
Say, "Have you considered, if God's punishment comes upon you, or the Hour of Doom will come upon you, if you call upon Allah, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but, if you call upon Him, He will remove it, and He will remove for you His distress, and you will forget what you associate with Him.
And We sent apostles before you, so that they might return to them, and We seized them with tribulation and adversity, so that they might humble themselves.
And why did they not, when Our punishment came upon them, they would humble themselves, and their hearts hardened, and their hearts hardened.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded, We opened upon them the gates of what they had been given, and We opened upon them what they were in, and We seized them suddenly.
So the people of the evil-doers were annihilated, and the last of them. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
Say, ‘Have you considered, if God has sealed your hearing and your sight, and sealed your hearing and your sight, and sealed a god other than God?” Thus do We explain Our signs for a people who reflect.
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah should come upon you suddenly, or the punishment of the unjust?"
And We send not the Messenger as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. And those who believe and do good works shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
But as for those who deny Our signs, they shall have a disgraceful punishment.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I say, "I am only an angel." Say, "I am only an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me." Say, "Have the blind and the seeing?" Will you not then reflect?
And warn those who fear the encounter of their Lord, for those who fear their Lord, there is no protector for them, nor will they grieve.
And do not follow those who pray to their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. They are not accountable for them for their reckoning, nor will they be accountable for them. So follow them, and do not follow them.
And We made some of them some of others to test others, and they said: "This is that which Allah has bestowed upon us?" Does Allah not know best those who are grateful?
And when those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say, "Peace be upon you, your Lord has mercy for Himself." Whoever commits evil, then, he who does evil will be made to suffer a evil deed. And whoever repents and reforms, then Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
Thus do We explain the signs, so that they may be guided.
Say, "I have been forbidden to worship those whom you call besides besides God." Say, "I do not follow your desires, nor will I be of the ignorant."
Say, "I have come to my Lord with clear proofs, and I am not responsible for what you do. I do not judge for what you have been commanded. He is the Best of judges."
Say, "If what you seek to hasten, I would not be able to ask you with me. God knows best those who do wrong."
And in Him are the keys of the unseen. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the earth and the earth. No leaf falls in the darkness of the earth, nor is there any grain in the earth, nor is there a clear Book.
It is He who has made you the night, and He knows what is in the day, and He knows what is in the day, and He raises you to a appointed term, and He will bring you back to the Day of Resurrection, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
He has power over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, and when death comes to you, he says, "Our death has come to you, and they are not aware.
Then they will be returned to their Lord, and they will be returned to Allah, and He is the swiftest of reckoners.
Say, "Who delivers you from the darkness of the darkness of the land and sea, and when you call you to Him, you call to Him?" They said, "We seek refuge from God."
Say, "It is God who delivers you from their hands, and from every distress, and you associate others with Him."
Say, "It is Allah Who has sent down upon you a rain from your feet, or from beneath you, or from your feet, or to make you taste the violence, and make you taste the violence, so that you may see the signs of your Lord." Thus do We explain the signs for various people who understand.
And your people have denied it, but it is the truth. Say: I am not of you any guardian.
Every appointed term is a appointed time.
And when those who are engaged in Our revelations, they will not hear thee until they engage at one another, until they turn away from them, and let you forget one another, and sit not in the company of the evildoers.
And those who fear the good of their deeds are not accountable for them, so that they may be cautious.
And let the example of those who follow their religion is the sport and the sport, and the Hereafter, and the life of the Hereafter; and those whom they have earned will not avail them from Allah, and they will not be able to change it, nor will they be able to see Allah, and they will be seized by the fire, and for them is a disgraceful punishment.
Say, "Should we not go back to us except that we should be guided from God?" And if we turn back from the way of Allah, we will not have removed it from the earth, nor will we make it as a guidance to those who follow the right path, and those who follow the right path will say to those who follow the right path. Say, "The path of Allah is better than those who follow the truth, and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the Universe."
And to establish the prayer, and fear Allah, and to Him you shall be gathered.
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth, and the Day when the Trumpet will be blown, and the Trumpet will be blown, "Be the day of the heavens and the earth, and He is the Knower of the unseen, the Knower."
