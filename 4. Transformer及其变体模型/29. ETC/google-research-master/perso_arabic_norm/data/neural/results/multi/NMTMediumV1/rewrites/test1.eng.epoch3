And they have taken up partners with Allah, above what He has created them, and He has created for them sons, and daughters, and daughters. Glory be to Allah, above what they allege.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and He has created for him a child, and He has no consort, and He has created everything. He is All-Knower, All-aware.
Such is God, your Lord, there is no god but He. He has created all things. And worship Him alone, and He is all-sufficient of all things.
No soul hide what He sees secret, and He is the All-subtle, the All-aware.
Verily, your Lord has come to you from clear proofs, and he will be recompensed to his own soul, and whoever goes astray, it is no sin for them. Say, "I am not responsible to you."
And thus We make them the clear signs that they may say, “We have studied to you," so that We may make the people who know to the people who know.
Follow that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, there is no god but He. And turn away from the idols.
Had Allah had willed, they would not have associated them. And We have not sent them with them, and We have not sent them.
Do not revile those whom they call besides Allah, lest they have been reminded of Allah, and those who have been given them, so that We may have made every community seem decorous to them. Then their Lord will inform them to their deeds.

And if you were in the land, those who disbelieve follow the way of Allah, they would lead you astray from the way of Allah, and they only not follow it.
Surely your Lord knows best those who have gone astray from His path, and He knows the right path.
And what you disbelieve in the revelations of Allah, remember that you are of the believers.
And what is the matter which has been forbidden to you in Allah's name, and what Allah has forbidden to you what you have been forbidden to you? Many of them are compelled from necessity. Surely your Lord knows best what they do.
And the sin of sin and sin and sin, and those who do evil will be requited for what they used to do.

And thus We made the city a city, so that they might understand to them in the land, and those who commit corruption in the land, and they do not know.
Whenever there comes to them a sign, they say: "This is what Allah has sent down His Messenger, and we will not believe in it." And Allah has sent down to those who disbelieve, and their punishment is severe. And Allah is severe of punishment.
Whomsoever Allah desires to guide, He expands the breast of Islam, and He sends astray to whomsoever He pleases, and He leaves astray from his breast, and He lays astray on the sky. And Allah does not love those who believe.
This is the Lord of your Lord. We have explained the signs for people who understand.
Their Lord will be welcomed to them with their Lord, and they will be rewarded to what they used to do.
On the Day when He will gather them all together, and they will say: "O mankind of jinn, many men have led away from the jinn." They will say, "Our Lord, we have given us a share of this days." He will say: "Our Lord is the All-Wise, the All-knowing." He will say: "You will abide in it. Surely, your Lord is All-knowing, All-knowing.
And thus We have made those who used to do wrong deeds of what they used to earn.
O assembly of jinn and jinns, did not come to you from the messengers of your Lord, rehearsing to you My revelations, and you will say to them, "We testify against witness against what you used to do?" They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves."
This is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly, and they were not arrogant.
And all of them will have degrees of what they have done, and their Lord is not unaware of what they do.
And your Lord is Most Lord, Most Merciful. If He wills, He will remove you, and He will remove you, and He will replace you to whom He wishes, and He has made you some of the worlds.
Surely that which you are promised will come, and you cannot not escape.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Work according to your ability, I am acting to you, and I will know to know the Hereafter in this world. Indeed, the reward of the Hereafter will not be successful. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not prosper.
And of the cattle is some that Allah has forbidden for you, and the cattle, and those who say with Allah say, "This is Allah's promise." They will say, "This is God's promise, and they have invented partners with Him." And they will judge to their Lord, and they will judge to their differences.
And thus did We have made those who have made the covenant of Allah, and made their children seem decorous to them, and We made them from their religion. Had Allah willed, He would not have guided them, and they would not have taken them.
And they say: "Eat of cattle and cattle, and eat of what is forbidden to us, and eat of what they have given them, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and that which they fabricate against Allah is the liar.
And they say: "Eat of what is in the bellies of Allah and the cattle." But if they are forbidden, they will say, "These are forbidden of us." But if they are pleased, He will punish them for them; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
Those who do not follow their own foolishly and forbid the knowledge of Allah, and forbid them with what they have given them. They have lost the truth, and they have gone astray.
And it is He who produceth the palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-palm-trees, and olives, and olives, and olives, and olives, and olives, and olives, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and Allah does not love the wasteful.
And of the cattle is the cattle and the cattle. Eat of what Allah has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, you is a clear enemy.
Eight couples of two sheep of sheep, and two of goats. Say, "He is the two males of the two females, or the wombs of the two females? What is the wombs of the two females?"
And of the camels of two camels. Say, "Is of the two males, or the wombs of the two females, or the wombs of the two females, or the wombs of the two females or the wombs of the two females?

Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Verily, your Lord has forbidden to you what you do not have any partner to what you have been commanded to do. Do not kill your parents and your children.

And do not approach the property of the orphan in the property of the orphan, and do not be in the state of his own soul, and do not give the weight of his own soul, and do not give any soul to any soul. And do not speak to any soul, and speak to him, and fulfil the command of Allah, and Allah has made you what you may ponder.
And it is the straight path, so follow the straight path, and follow the path of those who follow you, and do not follow the path of those who turn away from you, so that you may be godfearing.
Then We gave Moses the Book (i.e. the Quran of the Taurat and the Injeel (Torah)] and a Injeel (Torah) and a Injeel (Torah) and a Injeel (Torah) and a Injeel (Torah)] and a Injeel (Torah) and a Injeel (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] and a Injeel (Torah) and a Injeel (Gospel), etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.), and a guidance (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and a Injeel (Gospel)] in their Lord.
This is the Book which We have sent down to you, and follow the right path. So fear God, O O Muhammad], that you may be grateful.
(Muhammad), tell the People of the Book (Jews), "Why is the Taurat (Torah) among the two parties (Jews) which has been sent down to us (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) or the Injeel (Gospel)], and they were unaware to them."
Or should they say, "Had it been been sent down to us the Book from the Book, they would have been guided to them?" But there has come to you from clear evidence from your Lord and His mercy, and a guidance and mercy to you, and he is more unjust than him who turns away from Our signs, and they turned away from them.
Do they not wait that they have come to you from your Lord, or your Lord comes to you from the signs of your Lord? And when there comes to you the sign of the Lord of your Lord, he would not believe in it. Say, "Wait, we are waiting to be waiting." Say, "Wait be to you, we too are waiting.”
Those who have divided their religion in the religion of Allah, and their sects are nothing. God will judge between them what they used to do.
Whoever desires a good deed, it will be a same like it; and whoever does evil, it is no evil deeds, and they will not be wronged.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Verily, my Lord has guided me (i.e. Islam), the Straight Path (i.e. Islam), and he is a religion of Abraham (i.e. the religion of Islam), and he was a religion of Abraham (i.e. Islam), and he was not one of the polytheists.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Verily, my prayer and my prayer and my dying, and my dying is only to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.

And it is He who has made you caliphs in the earth, and made you some above whom which He has revealed to you. And your Lord is swift for you, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
I're the student.
This is the Book which We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) in the Book (i.e. i.e. the Quran of the Quran), so that you may be comforted (i.e. i.e. the Quran of the Quran), so that you may not be able to reach it.
Follow that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow anyone other than Him, and do not be admonished.
And how many a town We have destroyed before them, and they destroyed them at the night, and at the morning they were sleeping.
So when Our punishment came to them, they would not say, "We were only unjust.”
Then We will surely question those who have sent messengers with Our Messengers, and We will say to them.
So We gave them what We had given them, and We were not absent.
And the weighing (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), and the scales (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), and those whose scales will be successful, and they are the successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, they will have lost it, and they used to deny Our revelations.
And We have made you in the earth, and provided for you a sustenance for you. Little little you give thanks.
And We created you, and We shaped you, and We sent down to you the angels, saying, "Prostrate to Adam," they prostrated him, and he was not one of him.
He said, "What prevented you what you saw me?" He said, "I am better than me, I am better than me. You created me from clay and created clay.
He said, "Get down to you in the land. You will not be blamed to be blamed, and you will be pursued."
He said, "Respite me respite till the Day of Resurrection."
He said, "You will be among the respited of the respited.”
He said, "I have led me astray, so I will guide you from the straight path.”
Then I will come to them and behind them from their right side, and from them from their right hands, and you will not find them.
He said, "Get down to you, despised, despised, despised. I will fill you with those who follow you."
And [Adam) said: "O Adam, dwell of your wife, and eat to you in Paradise, and eat to you, and do not be of the unjust."
So Satan whispered to them with what they reveal to them, and said to them, "What is your Lord's good tree, so that you speak to your Lord, or you will not be in the immortals."
And he swore to them: "I am indeed of you."
Then they ate them into deception. Then when they tasted the tree of the tree, they began them with their shame, and they began them with the leaves of the tree. Their Lord said to them, "Did I not forbid you what you did not know?"
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and forgive us not, if You forgive us, and You will surely be among the losers."
He said, "Get down to you, you are one of one another. And you have made the earth for you and a provision for a stated time.
He will say, "You will live therein, and you will be raised forth, and you will be resurrected."
O Children of Adam, We have sent down your vision to you, so that you may eat, and the raiment of your raiment, and the raiment of piety. That is the reminder of God, so that they may reflect.
O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan seduce you to seduce you from your parents, and he made them with the Garden of Paradise, so that they may recognize them from their mouths, and they will not see you with you, and they will not see you. And those who disbelieve do not believe.
And when they commit a indecency, they say: "We found our fathers and found our fathers." Say, "Allah is witness to us." Say, "Allah does not promise the promise of His promise, and you do not know.
Say, "My Lord is the All-merciful, the All-merciful, when you call upon Him, so worship Him alone, so worship Him to Him, and worship Him to the earth."
He has led astray to guidance, and a group of them has gone astray. And those whom they have taken astray from Allah, they are rightly guided.
O Children of Adam! Take the adornment of your adornment, and eat your adornment, and do not drink. Indeed, Allah does not love the wasteful.
Say: "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah and the adornment of the things of Allah, and what He has provided for His servants and the best things?" Say, "These are the life of this world in this world, and in the Day of Resurrection."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord is only-doer and the inward-doer, and the inward, and the inward, and the inward, and the inward, and the inward, and those who have been sent with Allah, and that which He has sent down to you, that you do not know.
And there is a community from every appointed nation, when they have appointed a term, and when they delay it, they will not be able.
O Children of Adam! When there come to you from among you from amongst you, relating to you My revelations, and those who fear not fear, nor will they grieve.
But those who belie Our revelations and scorn Our revelations, they will be the inmates of Hell, and they will abide therein forever.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies His revelations? Or have they have made the portion of a Book, and the angels will say to them, "Where whom you claimed besides us?" They will say, "Where whom you claimed besides God?" They will say, "We have forsaken them."
He will say, "Get down of the people of those who passed before you, and those who passed before you among the jinn, and there was a troop of those who passed behind before them, and its gates will be opened to them, and they will say, "Our Lord, we have led astray from the Fire." He will say: "Our Lord, grant them a punishment of a Fire."
And the group of them will say to them: "Did, you used to do not touch us, and you will be requited to what you used to do."
As for those who deny Our revelations, and those who deny Our revelations, they will not be opened to them in the gates of Paradise, nor will they enter the Garden, nor will they enter the garden. Thus We requite the guilty-doers.
They will have a bed of Hell into Hell, and We have made them from a Fire. Thus We recompense the unjust.
And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall not grant him in any capacity, and they will abide therein therein, and they will abide therein forever.
And We shall make them all fruits in their hearts, and rivers flow beneath them, and they will say: "Praise be to Allah, Who is the All-beneficent, the All-merciful. Had Allah willed, we would not have guided it. Our Lord has brought the truth."
And the dwellers of the Garden will say to the dwellers of the Fire, "Our Lord has been sent down to us." They would say, "Our Lord has already sent down what you used to do?" They will say, "Yes," they will say, "Yes," and they will be called to the curse.
And those who bar the way of Allah, and debar the way of the way of Allah, they will not believe in it.
And there is a barrier between them, and every one of them will be passed up, and the jinn will be called to them, and they will say: "Peace be to you," and they will not have entered them.
