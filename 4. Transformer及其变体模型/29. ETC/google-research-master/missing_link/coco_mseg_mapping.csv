# Mseg kitchen_island consists of various COCO instances: 27% table-merged, 60% dining tables, and 12% counters.
# Looking at the data, with kitchen_island they really mean the whole island, not only the top-part. So counters is incorrect and discarded as relation.
# Now dining tables are different from table-merged yet both include kitchen_islands. This means this is an overlap relation.
