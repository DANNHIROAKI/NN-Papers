# Distributionally Robust Optimizatized (DRO) Retrieval Models

This code implements the group DRO algorithm from the following paper:

> Shiori Sagawa\*, Pang Wei Koh\*, Tatsunori Hashimoto, and Percy Liang
>
> [Distributionally Robust Neural Networks for Group Shifts: On the Importance of Regularization for Worst-Case Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08731)

on the Movielens-1M dataset, with an application on two-tower retrieval models.

At the moment, the codebase is still work in progress.
