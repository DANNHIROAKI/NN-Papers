# Event Conditioning for Dynamical Systems via Diffusion Models

*This is not an official Google product*

This repository contains exploratory code for conditioning techniques for
sampling from diffusion models. This is particularly geared towards events that
arise in the prediction of future trajectories of dynamical systems. We study
several dynamical systems including non-linear pendulums and the Lorenz system.

This is a work in progress; and the results would be presented in an upcoming
research paper.
