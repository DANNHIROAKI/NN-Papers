This is a web app that loads a translation quality evaluation data file from a
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) evaluation and provides various computed
scores from the data. The interface allows the user to slice and dice the data
by applying various filters. One or more data files can be loaded by using the
"Choose file(s)" button, replacing any previo.

To use this, you need to serve just the file mqm-viewer-lite.html (either from
a web server, or just locally using file:// URLs).

This web app can be optionally invoked with a "dataurls" parameter, whose value
is a set of comma-separated URLs for data files. The URLs should be on the same
host as mqm-viewer itself, or should be fetch()able via Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing (CORS).

The data files should have tab-separated UTF-8-encoded data. You can find its
format details in the README.md file.

An optional header line in the first data file will be ignored (identified by
the presence of the text "system\tdoc").

Example data files and details on score computations can be found here:
