The opportunity to create a major Taiwanese airline had just arisen following a decision by the Taiwanese government to liberalise the country's air transportation system.	在台湾政府实施空运系统自由化后，就有机会可以创造一家台湾主要航空公司。
Government requirements still mandated global experience and financial capital requirements for any company seeking permission to initiate international airline service from Taiwan.	但在台湾要成立一家国际航空公司，政府仍然要求必须具备国际经验与财力。
Upon receipt of regulatory approval, EVA Airways Corporation was formally established in March 1989.	在取得监管单位批准后，长荣航空正式于 1989 年 3 月成立。
The airline was originally to be called Evergreen Airways, however this was deemed too similar to the unrelated Evergreen International cargo airline.	长荣航空的英文公司名称原本为 Everygreen Airways，但是这和不相关的 Evergreen International 空运公司过于接近。
In October 1989, the newly formed EVA Airways Corporation placed a US$3.6 billion order for 26 aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, including Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners.	1989 年 10 月，新成立的长荣航空，以 36 亿美元向波音与麦道公司订购 26 架飞机，包括波音 747-400 型与 MD-11。

First year revenues reached US$40 million.	头一年的营收达 4000 万美元。
In 1992, EVA Air received the first of its Boeing 747-400 aircraft on order, and launched its premium economy class, "Economy Deluxe", on its 747 transpacific flights to Los Angeles, beginning in December of that year.	1992 年，长荣航空订购的第一架波音 747-400 型飞机交机，同时于该年 12 起在飞往洛杉矶的 747 航班中推出豪华经济舱。

The name of "Takau" was restored in the late 1670s, when the town expanded drastically with immigrants from mainland China, and was kept through Taiwan's cession to the Japanese Empire in 1895.	打狗之名于 1670 年代左右恢复，当时因中国大陆移民，城区大为扩张，其名一直沿用到 1895 年台湾割让给日本帝国为止。
In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa James W. Davidson relates that "Takow" was already a well-known name in English.	美国驻台领事达飞声与其 1903 年出版的台湾通史中指出，Takow 在英文中已是个众人皆知的名词。
In 1920, the name was changed to Takao (Japanese: 高雄, after Takao (Kyoto)) and administered the area under Takao Prefecture.	1920 年，该地更名为 Takao（袭自日本京都的高雄），由高雄州管辖。
While the new name had quite a different surface meaning, its pronunciation in Japanese sounded more or less the same as the old name spoken in Hokkien.	虽然新地名的字面意义完全不同，但其日语发音和旧名的台语发音几乎相同。
After Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China, the name did not change, but the official romanization became "Kaohsiung" (pinyin: Gāoxióng) after the Standard Chinese pronunciation of 高雄.	自中华民国接收台湾后，并未变更地名，但其罗马拼音改为反应其国语读音的「Kaohsiung」。
The name Takau remains the official name of the city in Austronesian languages of Taiwan such as Rukai, although these are not widely spoken in the city.	打狗之名仍用于该市的南岛语族官方地名之中，例如鲁凯语，不过鲁凯语在该市并不常用。

The written history of Kaohsiung can be traced back to the early 17th century, through archaeological studies have found signs of human activity in the region from as long as 7,000 years ago.	高雄的历史记载最早见于 17 世纪初，不过考古研究发现七千年前该地就有人类活动的迹象。
Prior to the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the Makatao people of the Siraya tribe, who settled on what they named Takau Isle (translated to 打狗嶼 by Ming Chinese explorers); "Takau" meaning "bamboo forest" in the aboriginal language.	17 世纪之前，定居该地的主要是西拉雅族的马卡道群，住在明代探险家称为打狗屿的地方；打狗在原住民语中为竹林之意。
The earliest evidence of human activity in the Kaohsiung area dates back to roughly 4,700–5,200 years ago.	高雄最早的人类活动记录，可追溯至约  4,700 - 5,200 年前。

The prehistoric Dapenkeng, Niuchouzi, Dahu, and Niaosong civilizations were known to inhabit the region.	该区的史前文化遗址包括大坌坑、牛稠子、大湖、茑松。
Studies of the prehistoric ruins at Longquan Temple have shown that that civilization occurred at roughly the same times as the beginnings of the aboriginal Makatao civilization, suggesting a possible origin for the latter.	在龙泉寺的考古遗址研究指出，该地文化约与马卡道原住民文化同一时间，因此可能源自马卡道人。
Unlike some other archaeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved.	和该区域某些考古遗址不同的是，龙泉寺遗址保存相当完整。
Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as hunter-gatherer societies.	发现的史前文物指出，高雄港在古代可能是个泻湖，原始居民可能主要是采猎社会。
Some agricultural tools have also been discovered, suggesting that some agricultural activity was also present.	同时也发现部分农具，因此可能也有某些农业活动。
The first Chinese records of the region were written in 1603 by Chen Di, a member of Ming admiral Shen You-rong's expedition to rid the waters around Taiwan and Penghu of pirates.	该区最早的中文文献记载，是由陈第于 1603 年撰写；他随着明代将领沉有容的军队，驱离台湾澎湖沿海一带的海盗。
In his report on the "Eastern Barbarian Lands" (Dong Fan Ji), Chen Di referred to a Ta-kau Isle:	在他的「东蕃记」中，陈第称此处为打狗屿。
It is unknown when the barbarians (Taiwanese aborigines) arose on this island in the ocean beyond Penghu, but they are present at Keeong Harbor (nowaday's Budai, Chiayi), the bay of Galaw (Anping, Tainan), Laydwawan (Tainan City), Yaw Harbor (Cheting, Kaohsiung), Takau Isle (Kaohsiung City), Little Tamsui (Donggang, Pingtung), Siangkeykaw (Puzi, Chiayi), Gali forest (Jiali District, Tainan), the village of Sabah (Tamsui, Taipei), and Dwabangkang (Bali, New Taipei City).	目前尚不清楚这些台湾原住民是在何时登上澎湖海域的岛屿，但他们的足迹曾出现在今之嘉义布袋、台南安平、台南市、高雄茄萣、高雄市、台南加里、台北淡水、新北市八里等地。
Taiwan became a Dutch colony in 1624, after the Dutch East India Company was ejected from Penghu by Ming forces.	台湾于 1624 年成为荷兰殖民地，但之后荷属东印度公司在澎湖遭到明军逐出。
At the time, Takau was already one of the most important fishing ports in southern Taiwan.	当时打狗已是南台湾的重要渔港。
The Dutch named the place Tankoya, and the harbor Tancoia.	荷兰人称之为 Tankoya 或 Tancoia 港。
The Dutch missionary François Valentijn named Takau Mountain "Ape Berg", a name that would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century.	荷兰传教士瓦伦丁将打狗山命名为「猴山」，且出现在 18 世纪的欧洲海图之上。
Tankoia was located north of Ape's Hill and a few hours south from Tayouan (modern-day Anping, Tainan) by sail.	Takonia 位于猴山北边，距大员（今台南安平）仅数小时航程。
At the time, a wide shallow bay existed there, sufficient for small vessels.	当时有个又宽又浅的海湾，足以让小型船只进入。
However, constant silting changed the coastline.	但是，长期淤积改变了海岸线。

In 1630, the first large scale immigration of Han Chinese to Taiwan began due to famine in Fujian, with merchants and traders from China seeking to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape authorities in China.	1630 年福建发生饥荒，导致第一波汉人大批移民来台，来自中国的商人与贸易商，来此寻求购买荷兰人核发的狩猎取可，或是藏身于原住民村落中，以躲避中国政府追捕。
In 1684, the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan and renamed the town Fengshan County (Chinese: 鳳山縣; pinyin: Fèngshān Xiàn), considering it a part of Taiwan Prefecture.	1684 年，清国将台湾收入版图，将该地更名为凤山县，由台湾府管辖。
It was first opened as a port during the 1680s and subsequently prospered fairly for generations.	在 1680 年代，该地开港，接着带来好几世代的繁华。
In 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan as part of the Treaty of Shimonoseki.	1895 年，台湾依马关条约，割让予日本。
Administrative control of the city was moved from New Fongshan Castle to the Fongshan Sub-District of Tainan Chō (臺南廳).	该市的行政管理中心，自新凤山城移至台南厅凤山支厅。
In November 1901, twenty chō were established in total; Hōzan Chō (鳳山廳) was established nearby.	1901 年共新设 20 个厅，凤山厅也在当时成立。
In 1909, Hōzan Chō was abolished, and Takow was merged into Tainan Chō.	1909 年裁撤凤山厅，打狗画归台南厅。
In 1920, during the tenure of 8th Governor-General Den Kenjirō, districts were abolished in favor of prefectures.	1920 年，在台湾第 8 任总督田健治郎任内改厅为州。
Thus the city was administered as Takao City (高雄市 Takao-shi) under Takao Prefecture.	该市改制为高雄市，由高雄州管辖。
The Japanese developed Takao, especially the harbor that became the foundation of Kaohsiung to be a port city.	高雄在日本统治期间快速发展，特别是港区成为高雄日后成为港市的基础。

Before and during World War II it handled a growing share of Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan, and was also a major base for Japan's campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.	在二次大战之前与战争期间，自高雄出口至日本的农产品不断增加，该市也成为日本在东南亚与太平洋活动的主要基地。
Extremely ambitious plans for the construction of a massive modern port were drawn up.	也制定了非常积极的现代化港口建设计画。
Toward the end of the war, the Japanese promoted some industrial development at Kaohsiung, establishing an aluminum industry based on the abundant hydroelectric power produced by the Sun Moon Lake project in the mountains.	战争末期，日本在高雄推动某些工业发展，利用日月潭丰沛的水力发电资源，设立炼铝工厂。

The official romanization of the name came to be "Kaohsiung", based on the Wade–Giles romanization of the Mandarin reading of the kanji name.	官方罗马拼音改为「Kaohsiung」，源于「高雄」汉字国语读音的威妥玛式拼音。

As the production went over budget, Wei had problems securing additional capital; he then refinanced his home and put his family NTD 30 million (nearly USD 900,000) in debt before the release.	因为制作超出预算，魏无法取得后续资金，因此在电影发行前，魏抵押了自己的房子，而且让家人背负台币三千万元（约 900,000 美元）债务。
During filming Wei could barely afford the film rolls and lodging for the crew.	拍摄期间魏几乎付不出胶卷费用与工作人员的住宿费用。
Wei later said this film's zealous reception should help him manage his debts.	魏后来说，这部电影的疯狂卖座，应该能让他还清债务。
Wei believed "that the films that hit the screens before the end of summer vacation in 2007 were all 'safe bets'", because they avoided competition from Hollywood blockbusters.	魏相信「该片在 2007 年暑假结束前上片，是『打安全牌』，因为可以避开好莱坞卖座大片的竞争」。
Wei followed this theory when he released Cape No.	魏以同样的想法，于 2008 年推出《海角
7 in 2008. Besides, Wei focused on the promotion of the film.	7 号》，并专注于推广该片。
The film was released in August, 2008.	该片于 2008 年 8 月上映。

Also, Cape No. 7 earned Wei a subsidy of about NTD 100 million from Government Information Office.	《海角 7 号》同时也获得行政院新闻局一亿元新台币的辅导金。
Seediq Bale was released in 2011, but Wei began to work on the film much earlier.	《赛德克・巴莱》于 2011 年上映，不过魏很早就开始筹拍本片。
According to an interview, Wei got the idea to make the film Seediq Bale in 1996 when he saw a protest demanding land to be returned to Taiwanese aborigines.	在一次访谈中指出1，魏在 1996 年看到一场台湾原住民争取还我土地的抗议中，有了拍摄《赛德克・巴莱》的构想。
Wei began to study history relevant to the aborigines and decided to make a film about chief Mona Rudao.	魏开始研究台湾原住民史，决定要拍摄莫那鲁道的故事。
In late 2003, Wei raised NTD 2.5 million and shot a five-minute demonstration film in order to further raise NTD 300 million (USD 10 million) to shoot the complete film.	2003 年末，魏集资新台币 250 万元，拍了一部 5 分钟示范短片，希望能募得 3 亿元资金（约 1000 万美元）以完成该片。
The fundraising failed, and director Chen Kuo-fu advised Wei to make another film to win the trust of investors, so Wei turned his attention to make Cape No. 7.	募资失败后，导演陈国富建议魏另外拍一部电影以说服投资人，因此魏转而拍摄《海角 7 号》。
After the success of Cape No.	在《海角
7 in 2008 Wei returned to work on Seediq Bale.	7 号》于 2008 年大获成功后，魏回头开始筹拍《赛德克・巴莱》。
However, in 2009 Typhoon Morakot destroyed the set, and the cost grew from NTD 200 million to NTD 600 million.	然而，2009 年的莫拉克风灾，摧毁了拍片场景，经费从 2 亿元新台币增加到 6 亿元。
Aside from technical problems, Wei said that he had to direct the film and raise the money at the same time, and the company often ran out of money.	除了技术问题外，魏说他得一边拍片，一边筹款，公司经常没有现金。
Wei said this made him nervous and grouchy, and he had to rely on the patience of the family and employees.	魏说这让他不安且易怒，他必须依赖家人与员工的包容。
The film was released in September 2011, both locally and internationally.	2011 年 9 月，该片正式在国内与海外上映。

The film's title was inspired by the 52Hz whale, a creature dubbed the "world’s loneliest whale" because no other whales can hear its 52 Hz frequency calls.	该片片名来自一只被称为「世界最寂寞鲸鱼的」 52Hz 鲸鱼，因为其他鲸鱼听不到它低达 52Hz 的呼声。
As Wei said in a teaser, "Just like how no one hears this lonely whale, how many people have love inside of them but nobody knows?	魏在试片时说，「就像没听得到的寂寞鲸鱼一样，有多少人心中有爱却无人得知？
Or simply need a chance to say ‘I love you’ and be heard?"	其实只需要一个说出『我爱你』而被听到的机会？ 」

For a time, Gulangyu had the peculiarity of having constituted the only international settlement on Chinese soil apart from the more celebrated International Settlement at Shanghai.	有一段时间，鼓浪屿的特色是成为中国在上海这个更加知名的公共租界外，中国土地上唯一的公共租界。
Soon after Xiamen became a treaty port resulting from China's loss in the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, foreign residents on the island established an informal organization that became formally organized several decades later when its Land Regulations were approved by the government of China in May 1902.	1842 年中国打输第一次鸦片战争，签下南京条约，使厦门成为通商口岸后，岛上的外国居民成立了非正式的组织，而在数十年后的 1902 年 5 月政府核准该岛的规范后，成为正式的组织。
Eventually 13 countries, including Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Japan, were to enjoy extraterritorial privileges there and take part in the Kulangsu Municipal Council that administered the settlement.	最终有 13 国，包括英国、法国、荷兰、日本等，可以享有治外法权，在居地参与鼓浪屿参议会。
As with the Shanghai International Settlement, the British played a predominant role in the administration and Sikh policemen from British India were charged with the policing of the Settlement under the Kulangsu Municipal Police.	如同上海公共租界，英国在行政方面扮演重要角色，派任英属印度的锡克警察，受鼓浪屿警局管辖，维持租界治安。
The consulates, churches, hospitals, schools, police stations, etc. built by those foreign communities explain the predominantly Victorian-era style architecture that can still be seen throughout Gulangyu.	由外国社区建立的领事馆、教堂、学校、警察局等，是整个鼓浪屿仍留存许多维多利亚时代风格建筑的主因。
Japanese occupation of the island began in 1942, and lasted until the end of World War II.	日本自 1942 年起占领该导，直到二战后结束占领。
The Hokkien dialect is spoken on the island, as it is in Xiamen.	由于位在厦门，该区的方言是福建话。
After the establishment of the PRC, Gulangyu was a district of Xiamen, one of four in the municipality not located on Xiamen Island until 2003.	在中华人民共和国建国后，鼓浪屿在 2003 年之前，是厦门市的四个不在厦门岛上的区之一。
In May of that year Gulangyu District was absorbed into Siming District, and has since been administered, policed, and adjudicated from Xiamen Island, just across the Lujiang River.	该年 5 月鼓浪屿并入思明区，由就在鹭江河对面的厦门岛管理行政、警务、司法。
Gulangyu is unique in China as a "traffic-free island".	鼓浪屿是中国的「无车岛」，十分特别。
It is connected to the main island of Xiamen only by ferry.	该岛只透过渡轮连接厦门主岛。
Neither cars nor bicycles are allowed, thus providing an alternative to the frenetic Xiamen Island across the river, although the recent introduction of electric tourist buggies may be damaging the island's charm.	汽车和自行车都禁行，对河对岸的人厦门岛形成对比，但最近导入的电动旅游车，可能降低该岛的魅力。

Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties.	自南北朝开始，中国就有了烤鸭。
A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor of China in the Yuan dynasty.	元朝时，有多种不同烤鸭呈献给皇帝。
The dish, originally named "shāo yāzi" (燒鴨子), was mentioned in the Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages (飲膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen.	这道菜在 1330 年由饮膳太医勿思慧撰写的《饮膳正要》一书中名为「烧鸭子」。
The Peking Roast Duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming dynasty, and by then, Peking Duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus.	北平烤鸭之名在晚明一代逐渐发展起来，当时北平烤鸭是宫廷菜单上的一道主菜。
The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.	第一家专精北平烤鸭的餐厅便宜坊，于 1416 年成立于北京前口附近的鲜鱼口。
By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish.	在清朝乾隆年间（1736-1796），北平烤鸭在上层阶级开始普及，给了许多嗜食此物的诗人与文士许多灵感。
For instance, one verse of Dūmén zhúzhīcí, a Beijing local poem was, "Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig".	例如在《Dumen zhuzhici》中的一首北京当地诗句，就提到「以烤鸭和乳猪盛盘」。
In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing.	1864 年全聚德餐厅于北京成立。
Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks.	全聚德创始人杨全仁发明了烤鸭用的烘炉。
With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the Peking Duck to the rest of the world.	由于其创新与便于管理，该餐厅变得闻名全中国，且让北平烤鸭之名传遍世界。
By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike.	二十世纪中期，北平烤鸭已成为中国的象征，受观光客与外交人员喜爱。
For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China.	例如美国国务卿季辛吉，于 1971 年 7 月 10 日首次访问中国时，在人民大会堂拜会周恩来。
After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite.	在早上一轮没有结论的会谈后，午餐的菜色是北平烤鸭，后来成为季辛吉的最爱。
The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972.	隔日发表中美联合声明，并邀请尼克森总统于 1972 年访问中国。
Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck.	1976 年周恩来去世后，季辛吉再度访问北京，享用北平烤鸭的美味。
Peking Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.	北平烤鸭，特别是全聚德的，已成为各国政要如卡斯楚、德国总理柯尔等人的最爱餐点。
Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.	北京最有名的两家餐厅是全聚德与便宜坊两家百年老店，不但街坊闻名，且各有特色：全聚德以其烘炉烤法闻名，便宜坊则使用闭炉古法。
Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water.	育肥的鸭只，在屠宰后拔毛、取出内脏，并且以水完全洗净。
Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat.	接着自颈部开孔，灌入空气，以将皮肉分开。
The duck is then plunged in boiling water for 1 to 5 minutes, and then hung to dry.	接着将鸭过滚水约1到5分钟，接着挂起晾干。
This will tighten the skin and help the duck to achieve its traditional crispy texture.	这会让鸭皮紧绷，以创造出传统的鸭皮酥脆口感。
The duck is then glazed with a layer of potentially spiced and flavored maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water.	之后在鸭身抹上一层加有香辛料的麦芽糖浆，内部再以清水洗净一次。
A marinade of traditional flavorings, including soy sauce and five-spice powder, and more maltose, is then applied inside the body cavity.	接着自鸭身开口处灌入含有酱油、五香粉、大量麦芽糖的传统卤汁。
This will flavor the duck during the next step.	这样在接下来的步骤中，即可让鸭肉入味。
The duck is then left to dry for between 24 hours and several days in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator).	之后将鸭子置于干冷处（或是冰箱内）存放 24 小时至数天，以便干燥。
The drying allows the skin to crisp while roasting.	干燥过程可让鸭皮在烘烤时变得酥脆。
It is then roasted in an oven until the skin turns shiny brown.	接着放入炉中烘烤，烤到鸭皮变得油亮棕色为止。
While roasting, hot water is added to the body cavity as needed to ensure even cooking and tenderness.	烘烤时，必须将热水注入鸭身中，以确保均匀烘烤，肉质柔软。
Some preparations involve the duck being smoked with fruity woods.	需要准备一些果树木头来熏烤鸭身。
Besides traditional methods to prepare Peking Duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs around the world to produce the dish at home.	除了传统北平烤鸭制法外，各国厨师也发明多种在家调理的食谱。
Peking duck is originally roasted in a closed oven (Chinese: 焖炉), and Bianyifang is the restaurant that keeps this tradition.	北平烤鸭传统上使用焖炉来烤，便宜坊就是采取这种古法。
The closed oven is built of brick and fitted with metal griddles (Chinese: 箅子; pinyin: bì zi).	焖炉以砖块砌成，内有金属箅子。
The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang sorghum straw (Chinese: 秫秸; pinyin: shú jiē) at the base.	这种烤炉要在底部燃烧秫秸进行预热。
The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven.	当火熄灭后，要立即将鸭子放入烤炉内，让炉子内的余热缓缓将鸭子烤熟。
Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill.	主要的技巧是控制燃料与温度。
In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.	以焖炉方式制作，鸭肉会与皮下脂肪结合，使得口感绵密而多汁。
The open oven (Chinese: 挂炉; literally: 'hung oven') was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty, and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain.	挂炉是在清宫御膳房中发展出来的，全聚德连锁餐厅加以发扬光大。
It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees.	其设计可以透过燃烧桃树或梨树枝，一次烤 20 只鸭。
The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270 °C (525 °F) for 30–40 minutes.	鸭子挂在炉火上的勾子，以摄氏 270 度（华氏 525 度）烤 30-40 分钟。
While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals.	在烤鸭时，主厨会用一根杆子去晃每只鸭子，让鸭子接近炉火约 30 秒。
In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy, and can be eaten separately as a snack.	挂炉烤法中，脂肪会在过程中融化，皮会变得酥脆，可以另作为一道小点。
Almost every part of a duck can be prepared afterwards.	之后鸭子全身上下皆可食用。
Quanjude Restaurant served their customers the "All Duck Banquet" in which they cooked the bones of ducks with vegetables.	全聚德提供给顾客的「全鸭席」，包括佐以蔬菜的烤鸭骨。
The cooked Peking Duck is traditionally carved in front of the diners and served in three stages.	传统上，烤好的鸭子会在客人面前片鸭，且分三次上菜。
First, the duck skin is served with sugar and garlic sauce as dip.	首先，鸭皮会和糖与蒜酱当做前菜。
The skin tastes better while remaining warm, but it will cool down fast.	鸭皮尚存余温时最为美味，不过很快就会冷掉。

The diners spread sauce over the pancake.	食客要把酱汁淋上面饼。

Cucumber sticks are eaten as refreshment between Peking Duck rolls, but can also be rolled in the pancake.	吃完鸭肉卷后，可以吃小黄瓜以去油，也可以卷进面饼里。
The remaining duck (鸭架) can be cooked in three ways.	剩下的鸭架有三种料理方式。
The traditional way is to be cooked into a broth.	传统料理法是煮汤。
The meat together with bones can also be stir-fried with sweet bean sauce, or rapidly sautéed and served with salt and Sichuan pepper (椒鹽).	肉与骨会以甜面酱拌炒，或是以四川椒盐快炒。
Otherwise, they are packed up to be taken home by the customers.	此外，还可以让顾客打包带回家。
Whole Peking Ducks can be ordered as takeaways.	北平烤全鸭也可以外带。
The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil.	带回家的鸭子可以用烤炉回烤、火烤，或以热油回温。
When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of 150 °C (300 °F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160 °C (325 °F) for another 10 minutes.	使用烤箱的话，以摄氏 150 度（华氏 300 度）回烤 20 分钟，再以摄氏 160 度（华氏 325 度）再烤 10 分钟。
The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70 cm (28 in) above the cooking fire.	火烤法要先将鸭肉注以滚水，然后上烤架，离火约 70 公分（28 英吋）。
The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot.	滚水每 3-4 分钟要更换一次，直到鸭皮滚烫为止。
To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces and placed in a strainer held over a wok of boiling oil.	以油加热北平烤鸭，鸭要先切成薄片，放在滤网上，很快过一锅滚油。
The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.	鸭肉要在热油中浸泡数次。

Examples include Quanjude, Bianyifang, Changan Yihao (長安一號), Dayali, Beijing Xiaowangfu (北京小王府) and Dadong Kaoyadian (大董烤鴨店).	除了全聚德、便宜坊外，长安一号、大鸭梨、北京小王府、大董烤鸭店都相当知名。
Some restaurants, in particular Quanjude and Bianyifang, have long histories of serving high quality duck that they are now household names, or Lao zihao (老字號), literally "old brand name".	某些餐厅，尤其是全聚德和便宜坊，长期以来供应高级烤鸭，现在成为了「老字号」。
In addition, Quanjude has received worldwide recognition, having been named a China Renowned Trademark in 1999.	此外，全聚德在海外也相当知名，在 1999 年获得中国驰名商标头衔。

A large dam across the Yangtze River was originally envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919.	横跨长江的大水坝构想，最早出自1919年孙中山撰写的《建国方略》。
He stated that a dam capable of generating 30 million horsepower (22 GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges.	他说可以在三峡下游建立水坝，能产生3,000万马力（22GW）。
In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges.	1932 年， 由蒋介石领导的国民政府，开始规划三峡工程。
In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area.	1939年，日军占领宜昌，并且调查该区。
A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam in anticipation of a Japanese victory over China.	该设计「大谷计画」将在日本击败中国后建成大坝。
In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation head design engineer, John L. Savage, surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'.	1944 年美国垦务主任设计工程师 John L. Savage 调查该区域，提出「长江计画」大坝提案。
Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training.	约 54 名中国工程师赴美受训。
The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next.	该大坝计画原本打算采用一种独特方法来移动船只；船先开入低水位区与高水位区的水闸，然后以吊车与缆索将船移动到下一个水匣。
In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency.	如果是较小的船只，可以编组同时移动，以提高效率。
It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods.	目前不知道考虑这种解决方案的原因，是为了要省水，还是因为工程师认为大坝高低差太大，其他方式不可行。
Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, in the midst of the Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.	当时已经完成探勘、调查、经费研究与设计工作，但因中国内战打到一半，1947 年时政府停止该计画。
After the 1949 Communist takeover, Mao Zedong supported the project, but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first, and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress.	1949 年共产党夺权后，毛泽东虽然支持该计画，但先进行附近的葛州坝计画，而且因大跃进与文革造成的经济问题，也拖延了计画。
After the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, in 1956, Mao Zedong authored "Swimming", a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River.	1954 年长江洪灾后，1956 年时毛泽东写了《游泳》一诗，指出他对在长江筑坝的执着。
In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.	1958 年百花齐放运动后，一些公开主张反对该计画的人被捕入狱。
During the 1980s, the idea of a dam reemerged.	1980 年代，大坝计画再度开始讨论。

This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it must restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.	在 1998 年长江洪灾后，政府相信必须提高森林覆盖，特别是长江上游三峡大坝区。
In 2010, NASA scientists calculated that shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the length of the Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles.	2010 年，NASA 科学家计算大坝储存的水质量，会让地球每天变长 0.06 微秒，让地球中间变圆一点，两极变扁一点。
An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze.	大坝一个重要功能是控制洪水，对长江是个季节性的问题。
Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river.	数百万人居住在大坝下游，也有许多如武汉、南京、上海等临河大城市。
Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.	大片农地和中国最重要的工业区都建于河边。
The reservoir's flood storage capacity is 22 cubic kilometres (5.3 cu mi; 18,000,000 acre⋅ft).	水库淹没区的容量为 22 立方公里（5.3 立方英哩、18,000,000 立方英呎）
This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every 10 years to once every 100 years.	库容可以降低下游大型洪灾的发生频率，自原本十年一次降为百年一次。
The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a "super" flood.	该坝也预期可以降低超大洪水的灾害。

Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.	学者认为，这可能反映了该镇的经济重要性，而非其较低的政治地位。
During the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (江海关; see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade.	清朝期间，由于两个重要的中央政府政策变化，上海成为长江三角洲地区最重要的海港之一：1684年，康熙皇帝废除明朝对远洋船只的禁令，这项禁令自1525年以来一直有效；1732年，乾隆皇帝将江苏省海关办公室（江海关；见上海海关总署）从松江县首府迁至上海，并赋予上海对江苏对外贸易海关收缴关税的专属控制权。
As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.	由于这两项关键决定，上海到1735年成为整个长江下游地区的主要贸易港口，虽然在政治制度中仍处于最低的行政等级。
