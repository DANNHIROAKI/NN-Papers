In September 1988, during the 20th anniversary celebration of Evergreen Marine Corporation's founding, company chairman Chang Yung-fa announced his company's intentions to establish Taiwan's first private international airline.	1988 年 9 月，在庆祝长荣海运股份有限公司成立 20 周年期间，公司董事长张荣发宣布公司有意成立台湾第一家私营国际航空公司。
The opportunity to create a major Taiwanese airline had just arisen following a decision by the Taiwanese government to liberalise the country's air transportation system.	在台湾当局决定放开该地区航空运输系统之后，创立一家大型台湾航空公司的机会已经来临。

In October 1989, the newly formed EVA Airways Corporation placed a US$3.6 billion order for 26 aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, including Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners.	1989 年，新成立的长荣航空出手 36 亿美元，从波音公司和麦道公司订购了 26 架飞机，其中包括波音 747-400 和麦道 MD-11 飞机。

For a time, Gulangyu had the peculiarity of having constituted the only international settlement on Chinese soil apart from the more celebrated International Settlement at Shanghai.	有一段时间，鼓浪屿的特殊性在于，它是中国境内除了更有名的上海公共租界之外唯一的公共租界。
Soon after Xiamen became a treaty port resulting from China's loss in the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, foreign residents on the island established an informal organization that became formally organized several decades later when its Land Regulations were approved by the government of China in May 1902.	由于中国在第一次鸦片战争中战败，1842 年签订南京条约，厦门在成为条约港口后不久，岛上的外国居民就建立了一个非正式组织，几十年后，《厦门鼓浪屿公共地界章程》于 1902 年 5 月获得中国政府批准，因而成为一个正式组织。

Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties.	自南北朝以来，中国就有烤鸭。
A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor of China in the Yuan dynasty.	元朝时，曾为中国皇帝制作过一种别样的烤鸭。

The Peking Roast Duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming dynasty, and by then, Peking Duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus.	与这一称呼相联系的北京烤鸭在明朝后期得到充分发展，在那时，北京烤鸭已成为宫廷菜单上的主要菜肴之一。
The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.	1416 年，第一家专门经营北京烤鸭的饭馆“便宜坊”在北京前门附近的鲜鱼口开张。

For instance, one verse of Dūmén zhúzhīcí, a Beijing local poem was, "Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig".	例如，北京民间诗歌《都门竹枝词》之一写道，“烤鸭乳猪列满盘”。
In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing.	1864 年，全聚德在北京创建。
Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks.	全聚德的创始人杨全仁开发了烤鸭用的吊炉。

By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike.	至 20 世纪中期，北京烤鸭已成为中国的一种国家象征，受到游客和外交官青睐。
For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China.	例如，美国国务卿基辛格首次（秘密）访华时，于 1971 年 7 月 10 日在人民大会堂与周恩来总理会面。
After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite.	在上午进行了一轮无结果的会谈后，代表团享用北京烤鸭作为午餐，这成了基辛格的最爱。

Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.	在北京供应这道菜的两家饭店是全聚德和便宜坊，这两家都是百年老店，家喻户晓，各有风格：全聚德以挂炉烤制法而闻名，而便宜坊则采用最古老的焖炉烤法。
Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water.	肥鸭经宰杀、去毛、开膛破肚，并用水彻底冲洗。
Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat.	通过鸭子颈部的洞向皮下灌入空气，使皮与脂肪分离。
The duck is then plunged in boiling water for 1 to 5 minutes, and then hung to dry.	然后将鸭子在沸水中浸 1 至 5 分钟，随后悬挂晾干。
This will tighten the skin and help the duck to achieve its traditional crispy texture.	这样可以收紧表皮，有助于鸭子达到传统的酥脆质地。
The duck is then glazed with a layer of potentially spiced and flavored maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water.	然后给鸭子涂上一层可能添加了香料和调味品的麦芽糖浆，内部再次用水冲洗一遍。
A marinade of traditional flavorings, including soy sauce and five-spice powder, and more maltose, is then applied inside the body cavity.	然后在鸭子体内抹上传统风味的腌料，其中包括酱油、五香粉和更多麦芽糖。
This will flavor the duck during the next step.	这会在下一步骤中给鸭子增添风味。
The duck is then left to dry for between 24 hours and several days in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator).	之后，将鸭子放在阴凉干燥的地方（或冰箱）晾 24 小时至数天。
The drying allows the skin to crisp while roasting.	风干可以使表皮在烘烤时变脆。

The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven.	火熄灭后，立即把鸭子放进烤炉，通过烤炉内的热量对流慢慢把肉烤熟。
Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill.	控制燃料和温度是主要技巧。
In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.	在焖炉烤法中，鸭肉与皮下脂肪完美结合，因此鲜嫩多汁。
The open oven (Chinese: 挂炉; literally: 'hung oven') was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty, and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain.	挂炉在清朝御膳房中发展起来，为全聚德连锁饭店所采用。
It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees.	其设计为使用桃木或梨木等硬木明火烤制，可同时烤 20 只鸭子。

While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals.	烤制鸭子时，厨师可以用一根杆子把每只鸭子吊到靠近炉火的位置，间隔 30 秒。
In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy, and can be eaten separately as a snack.	在吊炉烤法中，脂肪通常已在烹调过程中融化，因此皮很脆，可以作为小吃单独食用。
Almost every part of a duck can be prepared afterwards.	鸭子几乎所有部位都可用于制作后续菜肴。
Quanjude Restaurant served their customers the "All Duck Banquet" in which they cooked the bones of ducks with vegetables.	全聚德餐厅为顾客提供“全鸭宴”，将鸭骨与蔬菜一起制成菜肴。

A large dam across the Yangtze River was originally envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919.	1919 年，孙中山在《实业计划》中最早提出修建一座横跨长江的大坝的设想。
He stated that a dam capable of generating 30 million horsepower (22 GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges.	他认为，有可能在三峡下游修建一座发电量为 3000 万马力（22 吉瓦）的大坝。
In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges.	1932 年，蒋介石领导的国民党政府开始进行三峡工程的初步规划。
In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area.	1939 年，日本军队占领宜昌并对该地区进行勘测。
A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam in anticipation of a Japanese victory over China.	在预期日本对中国取得胜利的情况下，完成了一份大坝设计，即大谷（音译）计划。
In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation head design engineer, John L. Savage, surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'.	1944 年，美国垦务局设计总工程师萨凡奇实地勘测这一地区，为“扬子江工程”拟定了一份大坝方案。
Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training.	约 54 名中国工程师被派往美国参加培训。
The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next.	最初的计划要求大坝采用一种独特的方法来移动船只；船只进入位于大坝底部和顶部的水闸，然后用电缆吊车将船只从一个水闸移到下一个水闸。
In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency.	对于较小的船只，为提高效率起见，将多组船只一同吊起。
It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods.	尚不清楚这一解决方案是考虑到能够节水，还是因为工程师认为大坝上下江面高度差太大而无法采用其他方法。
Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, in the midst of the Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.	虽然已经完成了一些勘探、测绘、经济研究和设计工作，但由于国共内战，政府于 1947 年停止了这项工作。

The government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180 billion yuan (US$22.5 billion).	政府预估三峡大坝工程将耗资 1800 亿元人民币（225 亿美元）。
By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan, among which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195 billion yuan on financing.	截至 2008 年底，支出已达 1483.65 亿元人民币，其中建设支出 646.13 亿元，居民搬迁安置支出 685.57 亿元，融资支出 151.95 亿元。
It was estimated in 2009 that the construction cost would be recovered when the dam had generated 1,000 terawatt-hours (3,600 PJ) of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan.	据估计 2009 年就可收回建设成本，届时大坝发电 1000 太瓦时（3600 拍焦），收益 2500 亿元人民币。
Full cost recovery was thus expected to occur ten years after the dam started full operation, but the full cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.	因此，预计将在三峡大坝全面运行十年后收回全部成本，但到 2013 年 12 月 20 日，三峡大坝已收回全部成本。
Funding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, corporate bonds, and revenue from both before and after the dam is fully operational.	资金来源包括三峡大坝建设基金、葛洲坝的利润、国家开发银行贷款、国内外商业银行贷款、公司债券以及大坝全面运行前后的收入。

About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5 tonnes of solid waste every day.	增加了大约 32个垃圾填埋场，每天可处理 7664.5 吨固体垃圾。
Over one billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created.	每年有超过 10 亿吨废水排放到河流中，这些废水在水库建成之前更有可能被冲走。
This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.	使河水看起来死气沉沉，污染严重，浑浊不堪。
In 1997, the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.	1997 年，三峡地区绿化面积从 20 世纪 50 年代的 20% 降至 10%。
Research by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would, overall, gain about 6,000 km² (2,300 sq mi) of forest by 2008.	联合国粮农组织的研究表明，到 2008 年，亚太地区森林总面积将增加约 6000 平方公里（2300 平方英里）。
That is a significant change from the 13,000 km² (5,000 sq mi) net loss of forest each year in the 1990s.	这与 20 世纪 90 年代每年净损失 13000 平方公里（5000 平方英里）森林相比，变化显著。
This is largely due to China's large reforestation effort.	这主要是由于中国大规模的植树造林工作。
This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it must restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.	这一趋势在 1998 年长江洪水之后得到加速，这场大洪水使政府确信必须恢复树木覆盖，尤其是在三峡大坝上游长江流域。
In 2010, NASA scientists calculated that shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the length of the Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles.	2010 年，美国国家航空航天局（NASA）科学家计算得出，大坝储水量变化将使地球白天的长度增加 0.06 微秒，并使地球中间略圆，两极略平。
An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze.	大坝的一大作用是控制洪水，这是长江作为季节性河流的一个主要问题。
Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river.	数百万人生活在大坝下游，武汉、南京和上海等许多重要的大城市都毗邻长江河道。
Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.	大量农田和中国最重要的工业区都沿江而建。
The reservoir's flood storage capacity is 22 cubic kilometres (5.3 cu mi; 18,000,000 acre⋅ft).	水库蓄洪能力为 22 立方公里 （5.3 立方英里；1800 万英亩英尺）。
This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every 10 years to once every 100 years.	这一能力将使下游发生大洪水的频率从十年一遇降至百年一遇。
The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a "super" flood.	预计大坝将尽可能减小哪怕是“超级”洪水的影响。

During the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (江海关; see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade.	清朝年间，由于中央政府两项重要的政策变化，上海成为长江三角洲地区最重要的港口之一：1684 年，康熙皇帝推翻了明朝自 1525 年起实施的禁海令；1732 年，乾隆皇帝将江苏海关“江海关”（参见"上海海关"）从首府松江迁至上海，并给予上海对江苏外贸的海关征收独家管理权。
As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.	由于这两项重要决策，到 1735 年，上海成为整个长江下游地区的主要贸易港口，尽管在政治阶层中仍处于最低的行政级别。
