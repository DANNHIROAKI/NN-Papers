# Proto Value Networks.

This code is supplementary material for the ICLR 2023 submission
"Proto-Value Networks: Scaling Representation Learning with Auxiliary Tasks".

This submission contains the same code that we ran all experiments with,
though it does not contain the code infrastructure used for running multiple
experiments in parallel. Its main purpose is to shed light on
implementation details.
