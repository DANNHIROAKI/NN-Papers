# Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning:

## About the competition

Welcome! At NeurIPS 2020, we ran a competition aimed at furthering our understanding of generalization in deep learning. To do so, competitors were asked to submit a python function whose input is a trained neural network and its training data and output is a complexity measure or generalization predictor that quantifies how well the trained model generalizes on the test data. You can find general information on the competition at https://sites.google.com/view/pgdl2020/.

This repository open-sources the dataset (trained models and associated statistics) used for the competition.

The competition data was split into several "tasks" (types of models and image dataset used), given to the competitors in three phases:

 * Phase 0: Public data was given to the competitors: they were able to download Task 1 and Task 2 to measure the performance of their metrics locally, before uploading submissions to our servers.
 * Phase 1: First online leaderboard, accessible at the beginning of the competion (also called _public leaderboard_). This leaderboard is composed of Task 4 and Task 5 and was used to compute the scores displayed on the leaderboard for the first phase of the competition. There was no Task 3 released in this competition, but we keep the original numbering of the tasks to avoid any confusion.
 * Phase 2: Private leaderboard, only accessible in the last phase of the competition, where competitors can upload their very best metrics. Winners are determined only on their score on this leaderboard (to prevent overfitting of the public leaderboard, as usual). This phase is composed of Task 6, Task 7, Task 8, and Task 9.

## In this repository

### What is available?

We opensource everything necessary to compute the scores for new predictors:

 * The checkpoints for each model: one for the trained model, and one for the initial weights.
 * The dataset on which the model was trained (some data augmentation have been applied on top of this dataset for some tasks).
 * A JSON file describing the architecture of the model.
 * A model_configs.json describing the hyper-parameters used to train the models. This is useful to compute the metrics. Please note that the parameters that are the same for all models in the task are generally omitted from this file, as they have no effect on the metric.

All these are included in the zip files that can be downloaded with the links below.

### And what isn't?

We do not opensource the following:

 * The codebase used to train the models.

## Description of the tasks

### Public tasks

#### Task 1:

 * Model: VGG-like models, with 2 or 6 convolutional layers [conv-relu-conv-relu-maxpool] x 1 or x 3.  One or two dense layers of 128 units on top of the model. When dropout is used, it is added after each dense layer.
 * Dataset: Cifar10 (10 classes, 3 channels).
 * Training: Trained for at most 1200 epochs, learning rate is multiplied by 0.2 after 300, 600 and 900 epochs. Cross entropy and SGD with momentum 0.9. Initial learning rate of 0.001
 * Hparams: Number of filters of the last convolutional layer in [256, 512]. Dropout probability in [0, 0.5]. Number of convolutional blocks in [1, 3]. Number of dense layers (excluding the output layer) in [1, 2]. Weight decay in [0.0, 0.001]. Batch size in [8, 32, 512].

#### Task 2

 * Model: Network in Network. When dropout is used, it is added at the end of each block.
 * Dataset: SVHN (10 classes, 3 channels)
 * Training: Trained for at most 1200 epochs, learning rate is multiplied by 0.2 after 300, 600 and 900 epochs. Cross entropy and SGD with momentum 0.9. Initial learning rate of 0.01.
 * Hparams: Number of convolutional layers in [6, 9, 12], dropout probability in [0.0, 0.25, 0.5], weight decay in [0.0, 0.001], batch size in [32, 512, 1024].


### Public leaderboard


#### Task 4

 * Model: Fully convolutional with no downsampling. Global average pooling at the end of the model. Batch normalization (pre-relu) on top of each convolutional layer.
 * Dataset: CINIC10 (random subset of 40% of the original dataset).
 * Training: Trained for at most 3000 epochs, learning rate is multiplied by 0.2 after 1800, 2200 and 2400 epochs. Initial learning rate of 0.001.
 * Hparams: Number of parameters in [1M, 2.5M], Depth [4 or 6 conv layers], Reversed [True of False]. If False, deeper layers have more filters. If True, this is reversed and the layers closer to the input have more filters. Weight decay in [0, 0.0005]. Learning rate in [0.01, 0.001]. Batch size in [32, 256].

#### Task 5

Identical to Task 4 but without batch normalization.
