# Flax Models

Collection of open-sourced Flax models.

These models are similar to the examples included in Flax's main repository:
https://github.com/google/flax/tree/master/examples

While Flax examples adhere to guidelines described in
[Github issue #231](https://github.com/google/flax/issues/231), the code
examples in this directory do not necessarily tick all the checkboxes, have
somewhat more variance in style, and are not covered by Flax presubmit checks.
