# Reverse channel coding algorithms

This repository contains two notebooks with basic implementations of various
reverse channel coding algorithms.

 * [hybrid_coding.ipynb](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/rcc_algorithms/hybrid_coding.ipynb) Hybrid coding applied to the example of Gaussian distributions.
 * [ordered_random_coding.ipynb](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/rcc_algorithms/ordered_random_coding.ipynb) Ordered random coding (ORC) and other schemes applied to categorical distributions.
