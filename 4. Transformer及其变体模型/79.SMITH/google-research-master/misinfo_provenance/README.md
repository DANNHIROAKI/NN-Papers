# Near-Duplicate Image Retrieval using Self-Supervised Models

This code repo contains a model implementation and data augmentation functions
to assist self-supervised models for near-duplicate detection.



## Training the model

To train a model for Near-Dup Image retrieval, first, make sure to 
install all requirements.

```
pip install -r model/requirements.txt
```

After this, run the train script located at `model/run.sh`, to start training.

```
sh model/run.sh
```
