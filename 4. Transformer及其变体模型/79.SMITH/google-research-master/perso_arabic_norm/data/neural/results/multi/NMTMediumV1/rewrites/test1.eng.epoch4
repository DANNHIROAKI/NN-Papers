In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful,
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Beneficent, the Merciful.
On the Day of Judgment,
You are our Lord, and you are not to help Us.
Guide the straight path.
A path of those whom Allah has bestowed upon them, and those who are led astray from the wrath of Allah.
<unk>
This is the Book, there is no doubt in it. It is no doubt for the cautious.
who believe in the unseen, and spend, and spend of what We have provided them.
And believe in what was revealed to you and what was sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and in the Hereafter.
These are a guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.
As for those who reject the truth (O Muhammad SAW), do not warn them or warn them or warn them.
Allah has sealed their hearts, and their hearts, and their hearts, and their eyes is a great punishment.
And among them are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and believe in the Hereafter.
They are unbelievers, and those who turn away from Allah, and they do not believe, but they do not understand.
They are divided in their hearts in the price of their hearts. They are a ones who are truthful and a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Make corruption in the land," they say, "We are just peacemakers."
Indeed, they do not understand the evil, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe of those who believe," they say, "We believe in it." They say, "We believe in it." But they are not aware.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe." But when they are with their hearts, they say, "We have been sent to you. We are not one."
Allah mocks them, and letteth them wander blind and blind.
These are the ones who have bartered guidance, so they have no power of their own price, nor will they be guided.
Their likeness is like those who kindled a parable of a fire, and when he sheddeth it, he took away from them, and left them in darkness, and left them in darkness.
Deaf, dumb, blind, and they are not going.
Or like a rainstorm of the sky, and the darkness of darkness, thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears, and they thrust their fingers in the night, and Allah encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away their sight, so when they may see it, and it is they who walk in it; and when they are in the darkness of darkness, they stand away in it. Had Allah willed, He could have taken their hearing, and Allah has power over all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord who has created you and those before you, that you may be cautious.
It is He who has made the earth a bed for you, and the sky, and the sky, and sent down water from the sky, and He sends down water for you, and that you do not know.
And if you are truthful in the Qur'an, We have been sent down to you, and if you are a sign of it, then call your call to Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do not do, then you will not be able, and the fire of the Fire, the fuel of the Fire, and those who have prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, glad tidings to good tidings of which rivers flow, and they shall say, "This is for us." They will say, "We have given us a share of which we have given us." They shall have purified spouses, and they shall abide therein forever.
Allah is not a likeness of those who have been a sign of Allah, except a gnat of a gnat, and those who believe believe, they know that they know the truth from their Lord. And those who disbelieve say, "This is not for Allah's name." And they have barred Allah, and He has led astray to them, and He does not guide any way.
As for those who break the covenant of Allah, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption in the land, and do not be the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah, then He gave you life, then then He will cause you to die, then then He will bring you die, then to Him you will be returned.
It is He who has created the earth for you, then then He made the heavens and the earth. He has created the heavens and the earth, and He is Cognizant of everything.
And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "I am a viceroy of the earth, and He has raised you in the earth." They said, "We shall see you in the land, and sanctify you." He said, "I know and sanctify you, and I know what you do not know."
He created Adam all of the names of Adam, and He created them. He said, "Bring your names, if you are truthful."
They said, "You have no knowledge of what We have taught us. You have no knowledge. You are the Knowing, the Wise."
He said, "O Adam, tell them." Then when they have told them, then said, "I do not tell you what I did not know. I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and what you reveal."
And (remember) when We said to the angels, "Bow yourselves before Adam," they prostrated themselves, but he refused themselves, and he was one of the unbelievers.
And We said, "O Adam, dwell in your wife, and enter the Garden of Paradise wherever you wish, and eat therein, and do not approach the tree."
So Satan tempted them to slip away from them, so that they were in the state of the garden, and We said, "We shall enter you." And you will be told of the land, and you will have a share of the land.
So he received from his Lord a word of his Lord, and He relented to him. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
We said, "Go down to you, and come to you, and when I come from My guidance, there will be no fear upon them, nor shall they grieve."
But those who reject Faith and deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) are the dwellers of Hell, they shall abide therein forever.
Children of Israel! Remember My favours wherewith I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant, and fulfil your covenant, and be wary of Me.
And believe in the Book which has been sent down to you, confirming what was in the Book, and do not believe in it, and do not believe in My verses, and do not sell Me, and fear Me.
Do not mix falsehood with falsehood, and do not conceal the truth.
And give the prayer and those who are steadfast, and bow those who bow down.
Do you enjoin good people, and forget yourselves, and forget yourselves. Do you not know?
And seek your prayer in prayer and prayer, and lo! for those who are in the Hereafter.
Those who do not believe in their Lord, and they shall be returned to Him.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favours which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you, and I have been given you all of the worlds.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted to ransom it, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall they be succoured.
And (remember) when We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you from a worst torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and were a great trial from your Lord.
And (remember) when We parted the sea (i.e. the sea) in the sea (i.e. the sea), and We saved you (Pharaoh), and drowned the people'aun (Pharaoh) and Pharaoh (Pharaoh) drowned you.
And when We decreed Moses to forty nights, then then he took to you a Calf, and you were unjust.
Then after them We pardoned you, so that you may be grateful.
And (remember) when We gave Moses the Book and the criterion, and that you may be guided.
And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to his people, "O my people! Indeed, you have wronged yourselves in the calf. So repent to your Maker, and turn your backs to your Maker. That is best for you in your Lord. And He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
And (remember) when you said to Moses, "O Moses, we do not believe in you until we see you, and you see the thunderbolt you were looking.”
Then We raised you to life after you, so that you may be grateful.
And We sent down water from the sky, and sent down manna and quails, and quails, "Eat of the good things We have provided you." We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.
And when We said, "Enter this town, and eat therein wherever you wish, and enter the gate, and enter the gate, and say, "We shall forgive you your sins." We will forgive your sins, and We shall increase the gooddoers.
So those who had been changed changed changed to those who had been changed to them. So We sent for the wrongdoers a scourge from the sky.
And (remember) when Moses prayed to his people, We said, "Strike down your staff." So twelve springs gushed springs, and twelve springs gushed springs. And he said, "Eat of the provisions of Allah, and do not spread corruption in the land."
And when Moses said, "O Moses, we have no power of this, and we shall return to our Lord, and our Lord will make us the place of his place, and your Lord, and his descendants, and your descendants, and your descendants, and your descendants, and your Lord, and the birds, and your descendants, and your Lord, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets.” They took their scheming.
Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do good deeds and good deeds shall be rewarded from their Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We raised the covenant from you, and raised you with the Mount (Sinai), saying: "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember that you may be cautious."
Then then you turned away after you, then the mercy of Allah would not have mercy upon you, and you would surely be among the losers.
And certainly, you were told of what you were told of the Sabbath of the Sabbath, and We said to them, "Be apes."
And We made it a deterrent for them and a succeeding generations, and a reminder for those who have been warned.
When Moses said to his people, "God commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Have you see us?" He said, "I am innocent of the foolish of you."
They said, "Pray to our Lord to show us to a cow." He said, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, nor, nor, nor old between them, and between them.
They said, "Pray to your Lord to show us to what she has revealed to us." He said, "He says, "He says, she is a cow, the cow."
They said, "Pray to our Lord to show us to a cow." She said, "This is a cow." And if Allah wills, We will surely be able.
He said, "This is a cow, she will be a cow, and there is no blemish in the earth, and there is no blemish in the earth, and they shall not have found it." They said, "We have brought her, and they were not able.”
And when you killed a man, then disputed, and disputed, and Allah knows what you conceal.
So We said, "Strike him a piece of a piece of a dead. It is He Who revives the dead to life and shows you His revelations, so that you may understand."
Then your hearts became hardened, even though they are rocks, and if they are rocks, there are rocks in which rivers flow, and some of them are rocks, and some of them are rocks, and some of them are fear from Allah. God is not unaware of what you do.
Do you think that you will believe in what they believe, and some of them are a party of some of them? But when they understood it, they understood it.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," and when they are alone, they say, "This is what Allah has sent down to you what you have been given to them?" They will say, "God has forbidden you to do you?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose.
And among them are some of them who know the Book, but they do not know the Book, but they are only guessing.
So woe to those who have been given the Book with their Lord, they say, "This is from God." They will purchase for them a small price, so that they may purchase a small price.
And they say, "The Fire will not touch us." Say, "Have you have a few of us." Say, "Have you have taken a covenant from God? Do you not know God’s promise?"
Yea! those who earns evil, and their own deeds shall be the dwellers of the Fire, and they shall abide therein therein.
And those who believe and do good deeds are the dwellers of Paradise, and they shall abide therein forever.
And (remember) when We made the covenant from the Children of Israel (saying), "Worship Allah, but give your parents to Him, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the zakat, and give the alms, and you were disregardful."
And (remember) when We took your covenant from you, saying, "Do not shed your blood, and you will expel yourselves from your homes, and you are witnesses."
And you thought to kill people from the people of the people who were a people of among them, and some of them are weak, and some of them are one of you. And if you had reached them, they would not have been able by it. And if you were returned to them, they would not take it in the life of this world. And if you have been given the life of this world, they will not have been given you. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
These are those who buy the life of this world in the life of this world. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor shall they be succoured.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book, and We gave him a messenger, and We sent to him a messenger, and We gave him the son of Mary, and We supported him with the Holy signs. And when there came to you a messenger from the messenger, he would not have taken your heart, and they were proud.
And they say, "Our hearts are hardened," but Allah has cursed them for them, and they will not believe.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming what was before them, confirming what was before them, and when the victory came to them, they recognized them, and they disbelieved, they disbelieved, and the curse of Allah is against the unbelievers.
Evil is they who have bartered that which Allah has sent down to them, and that which has been sent down to them, they would not believe in it. And whoever incurred the wrath of Allah, He will enrich them from His grace, and for them is a disgraceful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Come in what God has sent down," they say, "We believe in what we have given us." But they believe in what is revealed to them, and it is revealed to them. Say, "If you believe in God's prophets, you would have been killed."
Moses came to you with clear proofs, and you took your calf, and you were wrongdoers.
And when We made a covenant with you, and raised you with the Mount of the Mount, and We said, "We have given you what We have given you, and listen." They said, "We have heard and obey them." Say, "We have heard you, if you are believers.”
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you disbelieve in the Book of the Hereafter (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) of Allah (i.e. the Day of Resurrection, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.) of Allah, then if you are truthful.
And they will never be able to die for their deeds. God is the best of those who do wrong.
And you are eager of them in the life of the life of the life of the world, and of the idolaters. Each of them will wish that he will give them a thousand years, but they will not be able by a punishment. God is Observant of what they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is a enemy of Allah, he has revealed it to you (Muhammad SAW), a Quran (Muhammad SAW), the Quran, the Quran, the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), and a glad tidings.
Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His angels and His messengers, and the Michael, the enemy of God, the unbelievers.
And We have sent down to you clear signs, and none are not one of those who deny themselves.
Is it not a witness that they have made a covenant from them, they would have made them a party of them, but most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming what there came to them from a Book, confirming that which was sent down to them of the Book, and they were not aware of it.
And they followed the Prophet of the Book, and they followed the covenant of Allah, and they disbelieved, and the people who disbelieved, and they were killed of the people who were killed, and they were told of the people who had been told, and they were told of the Book. And they were not going of the people who had been given them, and they were not going of them. Thus they have made them a portion of this world, they would not have no power of it. Thus, they have been given them a share of this world, but they were not aware.
But if they had believed and been believed, Allah would have been better for them, if they had knew.
O you who believe! say not: say not, but say Unzurna, and say Unzurna, and it is a painful punishment for the disbelievers.
The People of the Book are not among those who have been given the Book, and those who have taken a Book from your Lord. And Allah singles down to His mercy whom He wills, and He will grant whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of bounty.
Whether We abrogate a verse, We abrogate it to be forgotten, or We bring it a like of it. Do not know that Allah has power over all things.
Do you not know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to whom you have no protector or helper?
Do you not say to the Messenger that Moses had been commanded to be questioned before Moses? Anyone who exchanges faith from the faith of God has strayed to go astray.
Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you back to you, after you have turned away from you. But if they turn back to them, they have already turned away after you. So pardon them, and pardon them. God has power over all things.
And establish the prayer and give the alms, and give good good deeds, and that you may find them with the good of Allah. God is Observant of you.
And they say, "The Jews shall not enter Paradise." They will enter the Garden. Say, "Bring them." Say, "Produce your proof, if you are truthful."
Yes, but whoever submits his Lord's countenance, and is good in good, and his reward is from his Lord, and no fear shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians are not based to the Jews, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, the Christians, the Christians, the witnesses." Those who do not say in the Book say, "God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection."
And who is more unjust than he who prevents the mosques of Allah, and strives in the remembrance of Allah, and strives in the remembrance of Allah, they will not enter it in the places of the garden, but they shall not be secure in the life of the world. That is the degradation of the Hereafter.
To God belong the East and the West. So turn away from Him. God is the Embracer, the Knowing.
And they say, "Allah has taken a son to Himself." Glory be to Him. He is the All-beneficent, the All-merciful.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a thing, He says, "Be," and it is.
And those who do not say say, "Why does Allah not speak to us or speak to us a sign?" Have, those who were before them said, "We have studied in what was before them." Thus We explain the signs for the people who believe.
We have sent you with the truth and a giver of glad tidings, and you will not be among the inmates of the Fire.
And they will not be pleased with your Jews, nor do they follow their religion. Say: "Allah is the guidance of the guidance." Say: "Allah is the guidance of guidance." And if you follow their desires, they will not have no protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book read it to hear it, and those who believe in it, they believe in it, and those who do not believe.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favours which I have bestowed upon you, and I have been given you above the nations.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor shall any intercession be accepted, nor shall intercession be accepted to ransom it, nor shall they be succoured.
And when Abraham prayed to his Lord and he fulfilled them, he said, "I am only a leader of you." He said, "I have made you a leader of the Children of Israel." He said, "The wrongdoers will never have a wrongdoers."
And (remember) when We made the House for the House of the House, and a place of security, and a place of security, (saying), "Take the prayer of Abraham, and pray to the House of Abraham, and Ishmael, and Ishmael, and those who circle, and those who bow around those who bow down."
And when Abraham said, "O my Lord! Make this city in this city, and provide them with the fruits of which We have given them, and in the Day of Judgment, and believe in the Day of Judgment." He said, "We shall give him the enjoyment of this world, and I shall compel him from the punishment of Hell."
And (remember) when Abraham (Ishmael) Isma'il (Ishmael) and the foundations of the House (Ishmael), (saying): "Our Lord! Accept us (O Muhammad SAW). Verily, He is the Hearer, the Knowing."
Our Lord, make us submissive of our descendants, and make us our descendants, and make us our rites, and forgive us, and forgive us. You are the Forgiving, the Most Merciful."
Our Lord, raise them a Messenger from among them, to recite them to them, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and teach them, and to them, and You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And he who follows his own desires, he who follows his religion, and he who chose him, We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I have submitted to the Lord of the Universe."
And Abraham had enjoined his children and his children. He said, "My Lord! Worship Allah, you have taken the religion of God, and do not die.”
What before you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), when you were called to his death, he said to his sons, "What will you worship me?" They said, "We have your Lord, and your Lord, and the Tribes, and Abraham, and Isaac, and God is the One, the Muslims.”
This was a community which they have passed, and what they have earned shall be repaid for what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what you used to do.
And the Jews say, "Do not be Jews or Christians." Say, "We follow the creed of Abraham." Say, "We follow the creed of Abraham."
Say, "We believe in God and the Book, and what was revealed to Abraham, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and what was given them. We have no distinction to them."
If they believe in you, they believe in it. But if they turn away, then they are still in schism. God will suffice you from you. God is All-hearing and All-knowing.
Allah is sufficient, and Who is the best of the better than the other, and to Him is the best than those who worship.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have, you have disputed with us with Allah, and He is our Lord, and your Lord is your Lord, and your Lord is your Lord, and what you are righteous."
Or do you say to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and the children of Jacob? Say, "Are you know?" Say, "Are you know? God is more knowing of those who do wrong, and who is more unjust than one who is more unjust than the unjust?"
This was a community which has passed before them, and what they have earned will be repaid for what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
The foolish people who say will say to them, "What has come to them from their Lord?" Say, "The East and the West belong to God. He guides to whomever He wills."
Thus We have made you a party of your people, a witness, and the Messenger, and the Messenger, and the Messenger, and the messenger. We have not sent a messenger to believe, but that he has not sent down any authority to you. Whoever turns away from God, he has no knowledge to be a people who have faith. God is Gentle to you.
We turn away from your Lord, so that he may make you (O Muhammad SAW), and you will turn upon them. So turn away from the Holy Mosque, and turn your face from the Sacred Mosque. And if you turn away, then you will know your faces. That is the truth from their Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what they do.
And even if thou shouldst bring them to the Book, they would not follow your qiblah. And if you follow them, they would not follow your qiblah; and if they follow the guidance after you, they would follow it from it. And if you follow their desires, you would surely be among the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it, they recognize their own sons. But some of them are averse to the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be of the doubters.
And there is a direction of the direction of the direction of a direction, but he who race to be good in good; then Allah will bring you victory; then Allah will bring you all together. God is Able over everything.
And turn away from your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the truth from your Lord, and that is the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn forth, then turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your face towards you, and turn away from your faces. And do not be afraid of those who have wronged themselves. Do not fear them, and fear Me, so that you may be guided.
(O Muhammad), We have sent a Messenger from you from you, to recite to you Our verses, and to purify you, and to purify you and teach you the Book and wisdom, that you would know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and remember I am grateful and ungrateful.
O you who have patience! Seek help in patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.

Those who conceal the revelations of God and His guidance, after them We have sent a Book, and those who have been sent down to them, Allah will cursed them and curse them.
except for those who repent and reform and reform and reform them. I am only-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die are faithless, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the curse of the great Day.
They will abide therein forever, nor will they be reprieved.
Your God is Allah, there is no god but He. He is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
And in His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the day and the day and the day and the day, and the ships, and the ships. And He sends down rain from the sky, and He sends down the rain of the sky, and He sends down the rain of the earth. And He has sent down the rain of the heavens and the earth, and He is signs in the earth.
And among mankind are some men who take up rivals to Allah, and those who have been joined to worship Allah, and those who have been forbidden, and those who believe are in the way of Allah. But if they see the punishment, they will surely be able to see the punishment of Allah. God is severe in punishment.
And when those who are followed them will be followed those who followed themselves, and they will see them, and they shall be gathered with their Lord.
And those who had been followed will say, "We would certainly be able to worship us." Thus, Allah will tell them to them, but they will not be able by the Fire, and they will not enter the Fire.
O mankind! Eat of the earth and eat of the lawful things, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is your open enemy.
He does not enjoin you to commit indecency and indecency, and that you do not know what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what God has revealed to you," they say, "We have found that which we found our fathers following us." Even though their fathers knew nothing, and they were not guided.
The parable of those who disbelieve is like a parable of a man who do not hear to hear anything, but do not hear anything, but deaf, dumb, and blind, they are blind.
O you who have faith! Eat of the good things which We have provided for you, and eat that Allah will be grateful to you.
He has forbidden you only carrion, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine. And whoever does not transgress, there is no sin for him. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
Indeed, those who conceal the Book of Allah, and purchase a small price for a small price, they shall not eat their bellies. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He speak them, nor shall they be a painful punishment.
These are they who buy the way of error, and the mercy of the mercy of the mercy of their Lord. And they are the owners of the Fire.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book with the Book, and those who differ about the Book are in grave error.
The angels and the hosts of your Lord will not be able to be blamed for any good, but whoever is in the Day of Judgment, and those who believe in the Day of Judgment, and the angels and His Messengers, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and those who are true.
O you who have faith, you shall be settled to the law of your parents. And whoever is pregnant, let him is a slave, and his wife is a woman who is her in his wife. And whoever is pregnant, he is his wife in his brother. And whoever is a wherewithal, he will be a rich of them. And whoever turns away, then a painful punishment is a painful punishment.
O people of the life of this world is the enjoyment of this life for you, that you may be cautious.
And if one of you die, then if he hastens his wealth, he will bequeath your parents, and the relatives, and the relatives. That is an obligation for the cautious.
But if he makes him, it is a sin of those who have followed it, and it is a sin of those who change it. God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
But whoever apprehends an sin of the testator, then the sin of the testator, then then a sin of the two parties, he will not be blamed for him. Indeed, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

On the days of days. And if you are sick, then wait of the journey. And whoever hastens on the journey, there is no sin for him on the days of the two days. And whoever volunteers not fast to the cause of his own accord, it is better for him. And whoever volunteers good, it is better for him.
(Muhammad), there is a Book that has been sent down to the people, a guidance, and a guidance, and a guidance, and the confirmation of the Book, and the Book. And you have given the Book a Book, so that you may be able by it. And if Allah wills, He will make you a like of it. So, if He wills, you will be grateful.
And when My servants ask you concerning Me, say, "I am indeed nearmost." Say, "I call the call of my Lord, and I will answer them to Me, and let them believe in Me.”
It is not lawful for you to inherit your wives for your wives. We have tested you, and you have seen them, so that you may have faith in God. And when you repent, He will have made you your strength, and you will not be able by them. God has given you the light of the night, so that you may not be able by them. God has sent down to you the Book, so that they may be cautious.

O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah, and do you testify?
O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth and the truth and the truth, and what you know?
And among the People of the Book, when there was said to them, "Believe in what was in the Book," and in the morning, and those who believe in the meeting of the world, they will turn back.
And do not follow those who follow the way of Allah, and say, "God has guided the guidance." But they say, "We believe in the way of God." They will say, "God's is the kingdom." And if you ask your Lord, He will grant him whomever He wills. God is Embracing and Knowing.

So, and he who fulfill Allah and his covenant, and Allah loves those who do good.
As for those who sell the covenant of Allah and their covenant, for a small price, they have no share in this world. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful punishment.
And among them there is some a party of the People of the Book, that they may recognize their tongues. They say, "This is a Book." And they say, "This is from God." But they say, "This is from Allah." But they know lies, and they know lies against Allah.

He said, "We have come to you, and I have been commanded with you, and I am with you, and I am with you with the witness.”
Then whoever turns away, they are the transgressors.
Do they seek any religion other than Allah, and who are in the heavens and the earth, willingly, and unwillingly, and unwillingly, and to Him they shall be returned.
Say, "We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the Tribes, and the Tribes, and the Patriarchs, and the Patriarchs, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets.

Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Why do you not believe in Allah's revelations, and then Allah is the witness of what you do."
Say, "O People of the Book! Why do you not believe in the way of Allah, seeking from the way of Allah? Do you know what you know? God is not unaware of what you do."
O you who believe! if you obey the Book, they will turn you back from your faith, and you will disbelieve in the unbelievers.
And how can you disbelieve in the verses of Allah, when the verses of Allah is recited to you? And whoever holds Allah's command, it is to you the way of Allah, and he who are guided.

These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you (O Muhammad SAW), to recite to them the truth, and Allah does not guide the unjust.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth.

They will not be able to harm you. But if they fight you, they will turn away from you, and they will not be succoured.
They shall be pitched by those who have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they were a host of those who have incurred the wrath of God. They have incurred the wrath of God and a unbelievers, and a group of them is a enemy. That is because they were the people who disbelieved in Allah and the prophets and were proud.

And if good good happens to you, they rejoice, but if some misfortune befalls you, they rejoice in it; and if you are patient, then fear your guile; surely Allah encompasses all that they do.
And [remember) when you entered your home in the home of the believers and the believers, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.

And that Allah may purge those who believe and do not die in the unbelievers.
What, do you think that you will enter the garden of Paradise? Why who were not able to cause you in the cause of God, and that they are steadfast.
You were longing to death before you, and you were your longing, and you were going.

Yea! Allah is your protector, and He is the Best of the righteous.
Those who disbelieve shall strike terror in the hearts of those who have been joined with Allah. They have no authority with God. Their abode is Hell, and their abode is Hell, and the evil-doers is the evil.

They say, "If you have been given us, it is the best of what you have been given." Say, "If you have been resolved, it is in the hearts of your hearts."
Those of you who turned up on the Day of Resurrection, the two parties met to them, they have made some of them. But Allah forgave them. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who believe! Do not like those who disbelieve, when they meet their brethren, when they were in the journey, they say, "If we had been given us, they would not have died." God will surely change them in the hearts of their hearts. God will bring the dead, and He is well aware of what you do.
And if you are slain in the way of Allah, then die, and the mercy of Allah, is better for the forgiveness of Allah.
And if you are slain, then be slain, and Allah will be gathered to all you.
(O Muhammad), indeed, by Allah's grace. If you were resolved, you would surely have been shown them. But pardon them, and ask them. So pardon them, and ask them, and ask them, and ask them, and consult them. So turn your trust in God. God loves those who trust.

They said, "If we had wished against you, you would certainly have been followed you." They say, "We have been given the hearts of their mouths, and God knows what they conceal."
They are those who were proud with their brethren, and they said, "Had they were slain, they would not have been slain." Say, "If you are truthful, you are truthful."
And do not like those who are slain in the way of Allah, they are alive, but they are alive.
That they rejoice in the bounty of Allah, and rejoice in what they have given them, they shall have no fear of them, nor shall they grieve, nor shall they grieve.
That is the bounty of Allah and His mercy. And Allah will not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to Allah and His Messenger, and the Messenger, and those who have done good deeds, for them is a great reward.
The people who were told of the people who were told, "The people has gathered you, so fear them from them." But they said, "God is sufficient for us."

God chooses His Messengers and His Messengers. So believe in God and His Messengers, and if you believe, you shall have a great reward.
And do not let those who do not think that Allah has given them of His bounty, they do not think it is better for them. That is for them is worse for what they have earned in the Day of Resurrection. And whoever is in the heavens and the earth will be encircled on them. God is aware of what you do.

And those who say say, "We have no faith to believe in the Messenger of God, until he has sent down to us a messenger, and he has come to him from the fire." Say, "My Messengers came to you with clear proofs, and that you are truthful?"
But if they reject you, they rejected Messengers before you, and the clear Book, and the clear Book, and the Illuminating Book.

And you will be in the state of your possessions and your selves, and those who have been given the Book before you, and those who have been given the Book before you, and you are patient. And if you are patient and fear of God, the matter of all things is indeed true.
And (remember) when Allah had made the Book a Book (i.e. the Prophet of the Prophet of the Prophet of the Prophet of the Prophet of Allah), he has set down the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.) of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.), and it will not be sent back to them, and they will not be able to conceal it.

Or have they a share of the kingdom? When they leave a people, they will not be able to do a speck.
Or were they jealous of the people that Allah has bestowed upon them from His bounty? And We gave Abraham the Book, and gave them the Book, and We gave them a great kingdom.
And among them are those who have given them the Book, and some of them have deviated, and for them is a Blaze.
Those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), We shall make them taste the Fire (Hell), and We shall have their skins in their skins, as as as as a skins of those who have been given them. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, Most Wise.

And when it is said to them, "Come to what God has sent down to you, and the Messenger, and when you are filled away to you, you are filled away."
How, if it comes to them, they would have their hands, and when they returned to them, they would say, "We have been given us, and we were not able.”

They are listeners to the devourers of falsehood, and if they come to you, judge between them, and turn away from them. But if you turn away from them, they will not harm you. And if you judge, judge between them between justice. God loves the equitable.
How can you come to them about the judgement of the Book, when the matter has been been revealed to them? But they turn away after Allah, and they are not believers.
We have sent down to you the Book, and the light, and the light, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the idolaters, and the idolaters, and the idolaters. That was the matter of God, and that they were not afraid. So do not fear them. Do not fear them, and fear Me, and do not be afraid.
And We wrote to them the Book, and a nose for an eye, a nose for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for it. And whoever does not judge, it is no expiation for him. And whoever does not judge with Allah, it is they who are the wrongdoers.
And We sent to them the son of Mary, Jesus, son of Mary, and the confirmation of Moses. And We gave him the Gospel and the Gospel, and the confirmation of the Book, confirming which was before it, and a guidance, and a guidance, and a guidance.
And judge to those who believe in what Allah has sent down to them, and do not judge in what Allah has sent down to them. These are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to you the Book from the Book, and the Book, and the Book. And We have sent down to you the Book, and the matter, and that which has been sent down to you, and that which is revealed to you from the truth, and that which has been revealed to you. And if Allah willed, He would have made you some people, and He has made you some people. To Him you will be returned.
And judge between them that which Allah has revealed to you, and do not follow their desires, and beware from them, and beware that Allah has sent down to you a Book from which is revealed to you. But if they turn away, know that Allah will afflict them of their sins, and most of men are transgressors.
What, do they seek the judgement of the judgement? What who believe in the way of God is better than the believers?
O you who have faith! Do not befriend the Jews and the Christians. They are allies of each other. And whoever of you are allies of one of you, then some of them are allies. God does not guide the unjust people.
And you are filled in the hearts of those who are in the hearts of those who are around them, they say, "We are afraid of it." But when it comes to them a trial, he will bring them a victory, and they will be remorseful.
And those who believe say to those who say, "Are these the ones who swore against God," they will say, "We have been sent to you, and they will be losers."
O you who have faith! Whoever of you turns away from his own desires, He will surely bring them a people who are niggardly, and He who love themselves, they shall make those who believe, and those who believe in the way of Allah. That is Allah’s grace, and He gives whom He wills. God is the Embracer, the Knowing.
Your Lord, and His Messenger, and the Prophet of the believers, and those who perform the prayer and pay the alms, and are steadfast.
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, and the believers, there is a party of Allah.
O you who believe! Do not like those who have been given the Book before you, as those who have been given you a mockery of your religion, and the unbelievers, and the unbelievers, and the unbelievers, if you are believers.
And when you call to prayer, they are with fun with you, and they are a people who are not aware.
Say, "O People of the Book! Why do you not hurt us against us, nor do they believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us, and that which was sent down to us, and you are most disobedient of the truth.”
Say, "Shall I inform you with a worse recompense of that which has been sent to you? Those whom Allah has cursed for whom He has cursed, and with them apes and swine, and some of them were proud. These are the worst ones.”
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe in it." But when they are faithless, they are in their faces. God knows best what they conceal.
You see many of them competing in sin and sin, and those who are forbidden of the property of men, and what they are doing.
Why is not the rabbis and the priests with them from their own reason and the devouring of their devouring. Evil is what they have been doing.
The Jews say, "God is the magician, and their hands.” They said, "We have forgotten it." No, but he is in the same. It is not for those who are proud. It has been revealed to you from your Lord. This has been revealed to you from your Lord, so that you may judge in the Day of Resurrection. God will surely love the corrupt of the unbelievers."
Had the People of the Book had believed, they would surely have found their sins, and We would have admitted them to them, and admitted them to the Gardens of Delight.
And if they had followed the Taurat and the Injeel and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel) from their Lord (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] and the Injeel (Gospel) has been been sent down to them from their Lord, they would have brought out from them from their feet, and most of them are evil.
O Messenger! The Book has been sent down to you from your Lord. But if you do not know them, you would not have conveyed the message of Allah. And Allah will protect you from you, and He does not guide the unbelievers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Do not follow it until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and the Gospel, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord. So do not grieve for the disbelievers.
Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do good deeds, shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We sent Messengers to them, and We sent to them a messenger, but whenever a messenger came to them, they would not take a truth.
And they sought that they were blind and deaf, and they blinded them, and then turned away from them. But many of them were blind and deaf, and many of them were blind.
Indeed, those who disbelieve say: "Allah is the Messiah, son of Maryam." Say, "The Messiah, the Messiah, the son of Israel, the son of Israel." He said: "O Children of Israel! Allah is my Lord and the Lord of your Lord." And he who associate partners with Allah will be the Fire.
Those who disbelieve say, "God is the third of three people. There is no god but He." But if they do not desist, they will have a painful punishment.
Do they not repent to Allah and ask forgiveness of forgiveness? God is Forgiving and Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was not a messenger, but he was a messenger before him. And he said to his mother, and his mother, and they ate food. See how We explain Our signs, and they will see it.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), "Do you worship other other than Allah, which you have no power of harm or harm? God is All-hearing and All-knowing."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Do not follow the religion of your religion, and do not follow the caprices of the people who have gone astray, and were led astray before them, and they have turned astray from the right path."
And of the Children of Israel (Jesus) of the Children of Israel (Jesus) who disbelieved (Jesus), and the Messiah (Jesus), and the son of Mary (Jesus), and Jesus (Jesus) was cursed. That was because they were the defiantly-doers.
And those who did not have been wronged to prevent them, and they were wont to do themselves.
You see many of them befriending of the unbelievers who have disbelieved. That is what they have been sent for them, but they will be in the Fire, and they shall abide in it.
And if they believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Messenger, they would not have taken for them a guardian, but most of them are believers.
You will find the Jews among the Jews and those who believe in the way of the believers, and those who say, "We are Christians." They say, "We are Christians," and some of them are priests, and they are not proud.
And when they see the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) to the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), they see their eyes overflowing with tears with their eyes. They say, "Our Lord, we believe in our Lord, and bring us the witnesses."
And why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? Our Lord will admit us to the righteous of the righteous.
Those who had been rewarded to God will be rewarded to them with Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the reward of the righteous.
And those who disbelieved and denied Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are the dwellers of Hell.
O you who have faith! Do not prohibit the lawful things which Allah has made lawful to you, and do not exceed the limits. God does not love the transgressors.
Eat of the good things which Allah has provided for you, and be cautious, and fear Allah, that you are believers.
Allah will not cause you in a covenant, nor do not be able to be able by your wealth, and you will not be able by what you have given them, and do not marry them in the least, unless he may not speak to them, or do not be able to marry it. And if you are unable, there is no obligation for you. So make the covenant of your hearts, so that you may be grateful.
O you who have faith, wine, gambling, and gambling, and divining arrows, and divining arrows. Avoid them, you will be successful.
Satan will make you all intoxicants and gambling, and your people, and the people, and the people, and the people, and the people, and the people, and the prayer.
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, know that you will know the message clearly.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, there is no sin for those who have eaten the right, and they believe, and believe, and believe, and believe, and believe, and believe, and believe. God loves the righteous.
O you who have faith! If you have a power of Allah, He will be your hands, and your lances will know that He will know you in the unseen. And whoever turns away, then a painful punishment is a painful punishment.
O you who have faith! Do not stand up in the state of the months, and do not spy against them. And if you divorce them, he will have forbidden for you a like of that which is forbidden for you, and he who have been forbidden for you will have a share of the man. That is an obligation for him. But whoever turns away for Allah's cause, it is no sin for him. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
Lawful to you is the game of the fish, and that it is lawful for you, and for the needy, and the needy, and the travelers, and the game of the land, and that you are forbidden in the land. And fear Allah, for you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, the Sacred month, the Sacred month and the garlands, and the garlands, and the garlands. That is that you may know that Allah knows the heavens and the earth. God has knowledge of all things.
Know, Allah's retribution is severe, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The Messenger is only to convey the message, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), "Do not eat the bad things, and do not corrupt the bad of the bad-doers. Have fear of God, that you may be successful.
O you who have faith! Do not dispute about what they have been revealed to you, then if you have been resolved to be shown them, then if you have been known to them, they will surely have come to you. God has pardoned you. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
A people of you asked to ask them, and they turned away.
Allah has not forbidden the Bahirah, Bahirah, Waseelah, Waseelah, and cattle. Those who deny lies lies lies to God, and most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what God has revealed, and the Messenger," they say, "We have found what we found our fathers." Even though their fathers had knowledge, but they were not guided.
O you who have faith! If you are ungrateful, you will be guided to harm it, and if you are guided to harm it, He will not harm you. To Him you will be returned.
O you who have faith! When you take a part of a man, he will make you two women, and if one of you are better than you, they would be better than you than you. But if you are steadfast, you would surely be able by the time of God. And if you are in the journey, they will not be able to offer it. God bears witness the testimony of the witness.
And if they are guilty, then those who have been guilty of the sin of the two-doing of the two-doing of the two-doing of the two-doing of the two of two of the two of their two people, they swear to the two of them, "Our testimony is truer than those who say, and our testimony is truer, and we shall not be among the wrongdoers."
This is likelier that they may be truthful, so that they may bring a testimony of Allah, or fear their oaths, and fear Allah, and be cautious of Allah. And fear Allah, and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
On the day when He will gather them all together, He will say, "What is what you have given us." They say, "We have no knowledge of this. You are the Knower of the unseen.”
And when the son of Allah said: "O Mary, son of Maryam (Mary), and show me (O Muhammad SAW) from the Spirit (i.e. the son of Mary), and to show you (O Muhammad SAW), and to show you from the mount of the mount of the mount of the Children of Israel (i.e. the Taurat and the Injeel (Torah) and the Injeel (Torah) and the Injeel (Torah)), and the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Torah), and the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Torah), and the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Torah), and the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Torah), and the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel, and the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel, the Injeel (Torah).
And when I said to the disciples, "My Lord, I have believed in me and I have believed in My Messenger." They said, "We believe, and bear witness."
And (mention) when the disciples said to the disciples, "O Mary, the son of Mary is to send down to us from the sky from a sky?" He said, "If you are believers, you are believers."
They said, "We shall eat that we may eat our hearts and our hearts, and that you may know the truth, and that you may be witnesses."
Jesus of Jesus said, "O our Lord! We have sent down to us a Book from the sky, so that you may be given the festival of the land and the people before us. You have given us a sign of this life, and provide us for us. You are the best of providers."
Allah said, "I am sent down to you. I have sent down to you from your own desires, and I will punish me from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection."
And (remember) when Allah said to the son of Mary, "O Jesus, the son of Mary is the son of Mary? Why do you have submitted me." He said, "It is no doubt for me." He says, "I have no knowledge for me." Say, "I have no knowledge of what you have done. You know what you do not know."
I did not say to them except that I had no knowledge. God is my Lord, and your Lord. I have raised them with the first time of the first time, and I have forgotten them. You have made them a watcher over you, and you are Witness.
And if Thou shouldst punish them, they are Thy slaves; and if Thou dost forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say, "This is the Day that the truthful will be truthful, and they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and they will abide therein forever. God is pleased of them, and He is the supreme triumph.”
To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is in the heavens and the earth; and He has power over all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and the darkness, and the darkness, and the darkness of the sight.
It is He who created you from clay, then then appointed for you a term, and a term is determined for you, and you are about doubt.
He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you do.
And there comes to them a communication of their Lord but they turn away from them.
Indeed, the truth came to them, but they belied the truth, and the news of what they used to come will come to them.
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them? We have destroyed them in the earth, and We established you in the earth, and We sent down upon them the rains of heaven, and made them flow beneath the rivers flow, and We destroyed them for their sins.
And if We had sent down to you a Book with the Book, they would not have touched it with their hands, and those who disbelieve will say: This is naught but plain magic.
And they say, "Why has not a angel been sent down to him?" Had We sent down a angel, it would have been decided, and they would not have done them.
And if We had sent him a angel, We would have made him a man, and We would have made them in the matter, and they would have been confused in doubt.
Other Messengers were mocked before you before the Messengers, and they scoffed to mock at them.
Say: "Journey in the land and see what was the end of those who were warned."
Ask them: "To whom belongs the heavens and the earth?" Say: "It is Allah Who has mercy to Himself. He has mercy to Himself. On the Day of Resurrection, you will surely be questioned about the Day of Resurrection. Those who are lost will not believe.
To Him belongs all that is in the night and the day. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Say, "Who is the guardian of the heavens and the earth, who has taken a guardian from Him, and He provides the sustenance." Say, "I have been commanded to be the first of the first, and I have been commanded to be the first of the polytheists."
Say, "If I disobey my Lord, I would surely have fear the punishment of the Great Day."
On that day, whoever turns away from Allah, it will be for him. That is the clear triumph.
And if Allah touch you with affliction, there is no remover to Him; but if He wills, He will have power over you, and He has power over all things.
He is the Mighty, the Wise.
(Muhammad), say, "This is the best of me." Say, "I have been a witness of God." Say, "I have been revealed to you, and you have been revealed to you. This is revealed to you that you have submitted to Him." Say, "I do not follow what you have no knowledge." Say, "I do not follow what you have no knowledge."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it, they recognize their own souls. Those who have lost themselves will not believe.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, and denies the lie? Those who deny lies lies to the truth.
And on the Day when We gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated others, "Where are those whom you are asserting?"
So they will not say, "God is our Lord, the Lord of our Lord. We have not been joined."
See, how they lied to themselves, and what they used to fabricate themselves against them.
And among them are some who listen to you, and We have made their hearts veils, and We have blinded their ears, and they have blinded their ears, and they would not believe in it. And if they see the sign, they say, “This is nothing but ancient legends."
They turn away from them, and they turn away from their own souls, and they do not see except themselves except themselves.
And if they see the Fire, they will say, "If we had been returned to us, we would not have been returned to our Lord, and we will not believe in the signs of our Lord."
Nay, but it is only that they concealed what they had been concealing, and if they return to them, they would have been forbidden in what they had forbidden, and they are liars.
And they say, "The life of this world is nothing but we shall not be resurrected."
If you could see their Lord, when they are before their Lord, He will say, "Is it not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord." He will say, "Then taste what you used to disbelieve."
Those who deny the meeting of Allah will surely be losers. On the Day when the Hour will come to them, they say, "Woe to us! We shall bear what we have neglected." They will bear their burdens on their backs, and they will bear their backs.
The life of this world is nothing but a sport and a pastime. And those who believe is better than the life of the Hereafter. Will you not understand?
We know what they say to you, and they do not say, "You have rejected the revelations of God."
Messengers before you have already rejected before you, and they bore their rejection, and they were patient, until Our help came to them. There is no changing to God's words.
And if they turn away from your Lord, then if you are able to see the earth, or the ladder of the heavens or the earth, then bring them a sign, and if Allah willed, He would have guided them to them, and do not know the ignorant.
Only those who hear the truth, and they are the dead, and He will raise the dead to the Day of Resurrection.
And they say, "The sign of his Lord has sent down to him a sign from his Lord." Say, "Indeed, Allah is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
There is no animal on the earth, nor a bird of the earth, nor a bird of a bird of wings. We have no knowledge in the Book. We have given a Book a Book.
Those who deny Our revelations are deaf and dumb, and are deaf in darkness. God leads whomever He wills and guides whomever He wills.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered that if Allah's punishment should come upon you, or the Day of Resurrection, if you are truthful, you will not be able to protect Allah?"
No, but, if He wills, He will remove you, and He will remove you to call you to Him, and to Him you call partners.
And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW) to nations before you, and We seized them with a severe torment, so that they might be humble.
So when Our punishment came to them, they would not humble themselves, and their hearts became hardened, and Satan has made them fair fair deeds.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded, We opened them to them, and We opened the gates of what they had been given them. So We seized them suddenly, while they were in despair.
As for those who were unjust in the way of the city. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have, if Allah had made you hearing, and your hearts, and your hearts, and your hearts, and your hearts, other than Allah can bring you. See how We explain the Ayat (proofs)."
Say (O Muhammad SAW, O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered that if Allah's punishment comes to you suddenly suddenly or openly would be destroyed to be destroyed except the wrongdoing people?"
And We have sent the Prophet of the Messengers and the herald of glad tidings. And those who repent and mend and repent shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc, etc.), for them they shall be punished.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, and I do not know what I do not know the unseen. I am only that I am commanded to follow what is revealed to me." Say, "Are those who do not see the blind? Do you not then be able?"
And warn them from their Lord, that they may fear from their Lord, and there who have no protector besides Him, and that they may be cautious.
And let not those who call their Lord morning in the night and the evening, and seek the way of their Lord. They are not accountable for you, and you will not be able for them, nor will you turn them away from them.
And We have made some of them a trial for them, because they say: "This is the same of us who have been given us." Does not Allah not know the grateful?
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say, "Peace be upon you. Your Lord has mercy to you. And whoever fears you commits evil, then then repent thereafter, and thereafter is He who turns back, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”
Thus do We explain Our verses, and so that they may be a people who are warned.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I have been forbidden to worship other than Allah, other than Allah." Say, "I do not follow your desires lest I follow me, and I would not be guided to the righteous."
Say, "I am only a clear proof from my Lord, and you have rejected them. I have no power for what you have been impatient to me. God is the truth, the best.”
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you wish to hasten to hasten for me, I would have been decided between you. Indeed, Allah is the best of those who do wrong."
To Him belongs the keys of the unseen and what there is no doubt. He knows what is in the earth, and He knows the earth. He knows it, and He knows the earth. No leaf is in the grain of the heavens and the earth. No is in a clear Book.
And it is He who makes you the night, and He knows what you will, and He will know you in the Day of Resurrection; then He will make you your term, then to Him you shall be returned.
He is the Conqueror, Owner of His servants. He sends you to die, and when you die comes to Us, Our messengers will give them away, and they are not neglectful.
Then they will be returned to Allah, their Lord, the True. His is the judgement. He is the swiftest of the reckoning.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and the sea, and when you call upon Him, call your call to Him, and call you with the call."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah will protect you from your sins, and He will protect you from every affliction."
Say, "It is He who has sent down to you from the sky, to protect you from the sky, or He will bring you taste a factions, and you will make you taste the violence of your enemies. Look how We explain the signs, so that they may understand.”
And you disbelieve in the truth, and it is the truth. Say: "I am not a guardian over you."
Every soul is a finality, and you will come to know.
And when you see those who engage with Our verses, they turn away from you, until they turn away from them, until they engage to do other of them. But if you were reminded to do not see the unjust of the unjust.
And those who are cautious are not accountable for those who have earned, and that they may be cautious.
And be not like those who are divided in the life of this world and the pastime, and the life of the life of this world, and the heaviness of the life of this world, so that they may be secure. And as for those who have been given it, they shall not have any protector besides it. And if Allah had no power of him, they shall have no protector, and a painful punishment.
Say, "Why is Allah that can protect us from Allah, or will we harm it, nor harm it harm from him." And if Allah had sent us to see us, they would not have been guided to see you, and the hearts of those who have been left to go away. Say to them, "The way of God has been guided to us." Say, "I have been commanded to follow the way of God, and we have been commanded to submit."
(O Muhammad), be steadfast, and pray to God and fear Him. He is the All-sufficient.
It is He who has created the heavens and the earth, and the day, and the Day when the Hour will be sounded. He will say, "Be," and it is the truth. His is the sovereignty on the trumpet. He is the All-knowing and the All-wise.
And (remember) when Ibrahim said to his father, "O my father! Why do you take gods besides Allah? I see you and you are a clear people."
And We gave him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and the earth, that he might be of the believers.
Then when he saw the night, he saw it rising, he said, "This is my Lord." And when it was said, he said, "I do not love me."
And when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "If my Lord does not guide me, I would surely be among the people astray."
And when he saw the sun rising, he said: This is my Lord! This is the greatest of it. And when he set, he said: O my people! I am innocent of what you associate.
I have set my face to Him. He has created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the idolaters.
And his people argued to him, and said, "Do you dispute about me about Allah? He has guided me to me, and I do not consider you any partner to Him. My Lord encompasses all things."
And do you fear that I should not fear you with Allah, and do not fear that you have been sent down to God? Do you not have any authority over God? What is the best of the two parties?
Those who believe and do not believe in the way of their Lord, for them are security, and they are rightly guided.
This is Our argument which We gave to Abraham (O Muhammad SAW) to his people. We raise them to degrees in degrees. Verily, your Lord is Knowing, Knowing.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and We guided him, and We guided Noah to the people of Noah, and his descendants, and Job, and Job, Job and Job, and Moses, and Aaron. Thus do We reward the good.
And Zakariya and Jesus, and Jesus, and Elias, and We were among the righteous.
And Ishmael and Elisha, and Jonah, and Jonah, and the people of Jonah.
And to their fathers, their fathers and their descendants, and their brethren, and We chose them and guided them to a Straight Path.
This is the guidance of Allah which He guides to His servants whom He wills, and if they have been idolaters, they would have been done for them.
These are the ones of whom We gave the Book and the Prophethood and the Prophethood and the Prophethood. But if they do not believe, We have made the people who believe not.
These are they whom Allah has guided. So follow them. Say, "I ask no reward of you. This is only a reminder for the worlds."
And of the covenant of Allah that He has not sent down to them, they say, "Why has no angel been sent down to him." Say, "The Book has been sent down to you." Say, "The Book has been sent down to you, and you conceal what you conceal." Say, "God knows what He has revealed to you, and they leave their prayers, and in their leave.”
This was the Book which We have sent down to the Book, which was revealed to them, and that which was revealed to you, and those who believe in the Book, and those who believe in the Hereafter, and their prayers, and their prayers.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or say, "It has been revealed to me from me." Say, "The Book has been sent down to you." And if you see it, they will say, "We have been sent down to the Book." But if you see it, they will say, "You have been given the punishment of God."
We shall bring you to Us a first time of Us, and We have been sent down to you from the first time of your deeds. We will not have been sent with you, and you will not see those whom you asserted to do, and you will not see those whom you asserted, and you will be questioned about what you used to differ.
It is Allah who splits the grain of the grain, and the grain of the dead. He brings the dead to the dead and the dead. That is Allah's. He is the All-mighty.
He is the Cleaver of the Daybreak, and He has made the night, and the sun and the moon, and the moon and the moon. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
It is He who has sent down the stars for you, so that you may walk in the darkness of the land and the sea. We have explained a signs for people who have knowledge.
It is He who has created you from a single soul. He has made you a lodging of a sun and a depository. We have explained a signs for people who have knowledge.
And it is He Who sends down water from the sky, and We produce it to grow of the earth, and We produce forth fruits of the grain of palm kinds, and olives, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates. Indeed, in this are signs for those who believe.
And they associate the partners of the heavens and the partners. He has created them, and they have no power of Him. Glory be to Him! He is the High, the Great.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when he has no consort? He has created all things. He has knowledge of all things.
That is Allah, your Lord, there is no god but He. So worship Him. He is the Guardian over all things.
No eyes can grasp Him, and He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Verily insights has come to you from your Lord. But whoever does evil, it is for his own soul; and whoever goes astray, it is only for them who goes astray, and say: I am not a guardian over you.
Thus are how We explain Our verses to you, and say: "You have studied," and We have made it a clear sign to people.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He. So turn away from the unbelievers.
And if Allah had pleased, they would not have associated Him. And We have not sent thee over thee, and you are not able of them.
Do not insult those who call others besides Allah, lest they have seen of God’s people, and that they have set up to them in the way of God. To their Lord is their return, and He will inform them to what they used to do.
They swear by God by the solemn solemn oaths that they come to them a sign from Allah, if they have come to believe, they say, "Our signs are God's." But if they come to come, they would not believe.
And their hearts will see their hearts and their eyes, but they shall not believe in the first instance, and We shall wander blindly in their transgression.
And if We had sent down to them the angels, and the dead, and the dead had gathered them, and We would have gathered them all together, and they would not have believed.
And indeed We have made every animal every enemy from the jinn, and the jinn, and the jinn. And if your Lord had pleased, they would not have been able it. And if your Lord had pleased, they would not have been able.
And those who do not believe in the life of the Hereafter, and seek to make them, and make them are good, and they rejoice in it.
(Muhammad), say, "I have no authority other than Allah? He has sent down to you the Book and the Book, and those who have been given the Book. That is the truth from your Lord, so do not follow the doubters."
This is the word of your Lord's words and justice. There is no changing to Him. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And if many of the people of the earth say to you, they would say, "Allah's way is only astray, but they are only conjecturing."
Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His guidance and He who knows the guidance.
And what you believe in the verses of Allah, remember that you have faith in God's name,
And what is not lawful for you that the name of Allah has been mentioned to you, and you do not eat what God has forbidden for you, and that which has been forbidden to you? Many of you are compelled by necessity. Indeed your Lord is well aware of the transgressors.
Forsake the sin of sin and sin and sin. Those who commit evil will be recompensed for what they used to do.
And do not eat that Allah’s name is not lawful to you. This is the sin of the devils, and Satan has made clear of the devils. But if you obey them, you are the idolaters.
It is He who says, and We have made him life, and We have made him a light of a light of which he is a likeness of the people who can not die in the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of darkness. Such is the recompense of those who have been doing.
And We have made a town a town for its people, because they may commit corruption in the land, and they are not aware of themselves.
And when there comes unto them a sign, they say, "We have been given the Book of God. We shall not believe in it. God has given us the Book, and the severe punishment. Humiliation to those who disbelieve."
Whomsoever Allah desires to guide the way of Allah, He expands to his breast, and He desires to go astray to whomever He wills, and he whom He wills, and he who were in the earth, it is a way of those who do not believe.
This is a path of your Lord. We have explained a signs for the people who believe.
Their reward will be from their Lord's hand, and He is the best of all things.
On the Day when He will gather them all together, and said, "My Lord, the people of jinn, many men of men." They will say, "Our Lord! We have given us a share of our Lord. We have given the term of this world." He will say, "You have been a Fire." He will say, "You have no power in the Fire."
And thus We treat those who do wrong of the wicked of what they used to earn.
O assembly of jinn and mankind! Did there come to you messengers from your own messengers, relating to you My verses, relating to you My verses, and the Day of Resurrection? They will say, "We testify against ourselves." They will say, "We testify against ourselves, and they testify against themselves.”
That is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly while they were unaware of the cities.
Each of them are degrees in what they have earned. Your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
Your Lord is Self-forgiving, Owner of His mercy. If He wills, He will remove you, and He will make you successors, and He will replace you to die.
Verily, you will be questioned, and you will not be able to escape.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): O my people! Work according according to your work, and I am acting to you. Soon you will know that the Hereafter will be the sequel of the Hereafter. And the unjust will not be successful.
And of the cattle He has created for the men and the cattle. They have taken a share of Allah, and they say, "This is Allah's." They say, "This is God's, and they are partners to our associates." And they will not be questioned about what they have been fabricating.
Thus, they have taken their partners to the idolaters, and the idolaters, and their children were made them, and they have made their own desires, and they would have made them their religion. Had Allah had willed, they would not have been able.
And they say, "We are forbidden of cattle and cattle, and cattle, and cattle." They will eat that they have no power of God, and they are forbidden by cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and they will punish them.
And they say, "This is in the wombs of the heavens and the earth, and for our wives." But if it is stillborn, they will be able to be equal. But if it is stillborn, He will punish them. He is Knowing and Knowing.
Those who do not follow their own foolishly without knowledge and knowledge, and they have been forbidden, and Allah has made for them a share of what they have earned, and they are not guided.
And He it is Who produceth gardens and untrellised, and untrellised, and palm-palms, and olives, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates. And do not exceed the measure of Allah.
And of the cattle are some for you, and on the burden of the cattle. Eat of what Allah has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is your open enemy.
Eight pairs, two of sheep, and two of goats. Say, "He has forbidden the two males, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females? Tell me, if you are truthful."
And of the pair of camels, and the pair. Say, "He has forbidden the two males, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females." Have, when Allah has enjoined you, he will have made you a lie, and he who invents lies lies to Allah, and who does not guide the way of Allah.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I have been forbidden to eat that which has been revealed to me of what has been revealed to me, or to eat the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine. And whoever is forbidden by necessity, do not transgress in it. Your Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."
And to those who were Jews, We have forbidden the fat of claws, and the fat, and the fat, and the fat, and the fat, and the fat of what adheres to their backs, or the entrails, or the entrails. We have made them their sins for their sins. We are the truthful.
But if they reject you, say, "Your Lord is the Lord of your Lord, and none will not be averted from the sinners.”
And those who disbelieve say, "Allah has not been joined to us, nor we we have associated anything besides Him, and we would not have forbidden anything." Thus they have forbidden them before them. Say, "Produce to us, if you have been given us. You follow only assumption. You follow nothing but conjecture."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah's (the conclusive Quran) is the conclusive religion. Had He willed, He would have guided you to the Straight Path."
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), "Bring your witnesses with what you say to Allah, and do not testify to them." And do not testify to them, and those who deny Our revelations and do not believe in the Hereafter, and they are not equal to those who associate their Lord.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), "O your Lord, what has been forbidden to you from your Lord. Do not speak to Him, and do not give your parents. Do not kill your children and your children. Do not kill your children, and do not kill your children." That is God’s law, and you will not be partial. That is the law of God that you do not know.
And do not approach the property of the property of the orphan, until he may be given his maturity, and give the needy, and give the balance, and give the balance, and do not give any soul. We shall not be able by any soul. Do you speak to yourselves, if you speak, and speak to Him. God has given you what you do.
"This is my way, so follow the straight path, and do not follow the ways of those who follow you. This is the order that you may turn away from His path. God has told you to be cautious."
Then We gave Moses the Book (Moses) in a manner (i.e. the Taurat and the Injeel (Gospel)], and a confirmation of all things (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and a mercy (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel)] and a mercy (of the Quran), and a guidance (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel)] in their Lord (i.e. the Taurat and the Injeel of Resurrection).
This is a Book which We have sent down to you, so follow it, and be cautious.
(Muhammad), say, "We have heard to produce the Book before the two parties of the Book, and We were unaware of what they were unaware."
Or lest they should say, "Had it been been sent down to us a Book, they would have been guided than them?" But there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and the mercy of the mercy of your Lord has come to you. But who is more unjust than he who reject Allah’s signs, and they turn away from Our signs, for them who turns away from Our signs.
Do they not wait that the angels should come to them from your Lord, or the Lord of your Lord comes to you, and the Day of your Lord comes to you, but the Day of Resurrection comes to you, but that there was no one of him who believes in it. Say, "Wait be to you." Say, "We are waiting of you."
Those who have divided their religion are sects and sects, there is no sin for them. God will judge to them, and He will inform them to all things.
Whoever does a good deed, it shall be a like thereof; and whoever does evil shall be repaid to a extent of his own soul; and whoever shall not be wronged.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has guided me to a Straight Path (Islamic Monotheism), and the religion of Ibrahim (Islamic Monotheism) was a Hanif (i.e. the Islamic Monotheism). And he was not one of the polytheists.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My prayer and my prayer and my death and my death, and my Lord is the Lord of the worlds.
He has no partner, and I have been commanded to be the first of the Muslims.
Say, "Shall I worship other than Allah? He is the Lord of all things. He is the Lord of all things. No soul bear the burden of another soul, no bearer shall bear another burden. To your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do.
It is He who has made you viceroys in the earth, and He has made you some ranks of others. He has given you of what He has given you. Your Lord is swift in retribution.
<unk>.
This is the Book which We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW), so that you may not be able to be able to reach your heart, and to warn it.
Follow that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow any other other than Him. Little do you take heed.
And how many a township have We destroyed before them, and Our punishment came to them at night, while they slept at noon.
So when Our punishment came to them, they would not say, "We were only unjust."
Then We shall surely question those who have sent Our Messengers to the Messengers, and We shall certainly be questioned.
So We sent them to them, and We were not absent.
And on the day, the weighing shall be brought, and those whose scales are heavy, they shall be successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, they are those who have lost their souls, and they shall have been lost of Our signs.
And We have given you viceroys in the earth, and made for you a livelihood for your livelihood. Little do you give thanks.
We created you, then We created you, and We said to the angels, "Prostrate down to Adam." But he refused, but he was not one of them.
He said, "What prevented you that you should not see your Lord?" He said, "I am better than me. You created me from fire and created you from clay."
He said, "Get down from your garden. Get forth from your pride. Get away, and you are humiliated.”
He said: Respite me till the Day of Resurrection.
He said, "You are of the respited of the ancients."
He said, "You have led me astray, so I will guide you from the Straight Path.”
Then I will come from them from their front and their right, and from their right, and from their right, and from their right, and you will not find them.
(Allah) said, "Get down from the Fire, despised and banished. You will fill Hell with those who follow you, and I will fill Hell with Hell."
And (Adam) said, "O Adam, enter the Garden of Paradise, and enter wherever you wish, and eat from it, and do not approach the tree."
So Satan whispered to them with what he had sent down from them, and said, "Your Lord has sent down to you the tree from your Lord, so that you may be truthful."
And he swore to them, "Indeed, I am of you.”
So he came to them, and they tasted the tree, and their private parts came to them from the tree, and the tree came to them, and they said, "Did I not forbid you from the tree?" And they called their Lord, "Did I not tell you from this tree?"
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You forgive me, and not mercy upon us, we shall surely be among the losers."
He said, "Get down from your enemies, you will be enemies of one another. And you have made the life of the earth and a time for a time.
He said, “You shall live therein, and you shall be brought forth, and you will be brought forth.”
O Children of Adam! We have sent down to you clothing from your own parts, and feathers, and the raiment of the garment, and the raiment of piety. That is better for the signs of God, so that they may remember.
O Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you to seduce you from your parents, he will recognize them from their shame, so that he may expose them from their shame. And he will not see you from his sins, but you will see them. We have made those who believe.
And when they commit a indecency, they say, "We found our fathers following our fathers." Say, "God has forbidden us." Say, "God does not command the least, and you do not know."
Say, "My Lord has commanded the true religion. So call your face to Him, and call your prayer to Him, and call Him to Him. He has created you, you will be returned.”
A group of the people who have been guided, and a party of them is true. They have taken a devils patrons from Allah, and they are rightly guided.
O Children of Adam! Take your adornment in the sea, and eat, and drink, and drink, and do not exceed the wasteful.
Say, "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah, and the provision of which He has given for His servants?" Say, "These are in the life of this world, the Day of Resurrection." Say, "These are the enjoyment of this world in the life of the world."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has forbidden indecencies, and what is apparent to you, and sin, and sin, and oppression, and rebellion, and what you have no knowledge to associate with Allah. He has sent down to you what you do not know.
And every time has been decreed for every appointed time, and when their term comes, they shall not be able to be able by it.
O Children of Adam! When there come to you some Messengers from your own proofs, relating to you My verses, and fear the fear of Allah, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc, etc.), they are the dwellers of the Fire, and they are the dwellers of the Fire.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or denies His revelations? Those who have been given a Book have been written down to them, will say, "Where is the Book sent down to you?" And when Our messengers came to them, they will say, "Where are your associates?" They will say, "We have forsaken us."
He will say, "O the dwellers of Hell, the jinn and the jinn were gathered before men." And there was a party of a people who passed behind, and he who passed behind shall say, "Our Lord! We have led astray." And they will say, "Our Lord, we have led astray from the Fire." He will say, "This is a painful punishment."
And the first among them will say to those who were given them, "We were not going to destroy yourselves. So taste what you used to earn."
Those who reject Our Ayat and reject Our signs, and their arrogance shall be opened to them, and they shall not enter them until they enter the garden, until they shall enter it. Thus do We requite the guilty.
Their bed shall be the bed of Hell, and their faces shall be Hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall not make him any burden of his capacity. These are the inhabitants of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.
And We shall remove their hearts in the hearts of their hearts, and will flow beneath them. They will say, "All praise belongs to Allah. Had Allah had guided us, we would not have guided it. Our Lord has already guided us." So will you say, "This is the Paradise which you have been blessed."
And the dwellers of the Fire will call out to the dwellers of the Fire, "Our Lord has promised us." They would say, "We have found what your Lord has promised." They will say, "Yes is to your Lord." They will say, "Yes," and the curse of the unbelievers will say.
Those who bar from the way of Allah, and seek the way of the way of God, they have not been in the Hereafter.
And there is a barrier between them, and on the Day of the Heights, and those men will be gathered to them, and they will say to them, "Peace be to you." They will say, "Peace be to you, and they will be in the state of the Garden.”
