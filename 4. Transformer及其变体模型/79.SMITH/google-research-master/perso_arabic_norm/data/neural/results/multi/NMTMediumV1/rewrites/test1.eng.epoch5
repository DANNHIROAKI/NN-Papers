In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.
The Beneficent, the Merciful.
The Day of Judgment,
You are your Lord, and help Him.
Guide us to the Straight Path,
A path of those upon whom Allah has bestowed upon His servants, and those who have gone upon them will have no wrath.
<unk>
This is the Book, there is no doubt in it; and Allah is the Guide of the cautious.
who believe in Allah, and establish the prayer, and spend of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and believe in the Hereafter.
Those are they who are the guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.
As for those who disbelieve, whether it is some of them, or warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has sealed their hearts, and their hearing, and their eyes, and their eyes, and there is a great punishment for them.
And among mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and believe not.
They believe in Allah and the believers, but they do not believe except themselves, nor do they understand.
In their hearts there is a disease in disease, and they have come to themselves. They will have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them: "Do not corrupt in the earth," they say: "We are reformers."
Indeed, they are the evildoers, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe of those who believe," they say, "We believe in it," they say, "Shall we believe in it?" They are not aware.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe." But when they are privily with their devils, they say, "We are with you; we are only mocking.”
Allah mocks them, and they wander blindly in their exorbitance, and they wander blindly.
Those are they who bartered guidance for guidance, and their traffic will not profit them, nor will they be guided.
Their likeness is like those who kindled the fire of Hell, when he lighted it, and when it covers a light, He took away their light and left them in darkness.
Deaf, dumb, blind, and they are not going to return.
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, and thunder, and lightning, and lightning, their ears are hardened, and they thrust their fingers in their ears; and Allah encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away their sight; whenever it flashes, they walk in it, and when they walk, they stand on it. Had Allah willed, He could have taken their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over everything Potent.
O mankind! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may be Godwary.
It is He who has made the earth a cradle, and the sky a canopy, and sends down water from the sky, and brings forth fruits from it. And know not with Allah with what you do not know.
And if you are a sign of which We have sent down to his Lord, then produce a chapter like it, and call upon you a like thereof, and call upon Allah, if you are truthful.
And if you do not, then you will not be able to ward it, and the Fire of the Fire, and the fuel of hell, prepared for those who disbelieve.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, for them shall be gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will say therein, "This is what we had given before before us," they will say, "This is what we had given before before." They shall have purified therein, and they will remain therein.
And Allah is not ashamed of the gnat, a gnat of the gnat, and those who believe in the Oneness of Allah; they know that it is truth from their Lord. And those who disbelieve say to those who disbelieve, "What is God's creation?" Thus Allah leads astray astray, and He does not guide the unjust.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption in the earth, it is they who are the losers.
How did you disbelieve in Allah, then did you disbelieve in Allah? He gave you life, then He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, and to Him you will be returned.
It is He who has created the earth to be in the heavens and the earth. Then He originated the heavens and the earth. He has knowledge of all things. He has knowledge of all things.
When your Lord said to the angels, "I am a successor of the earth," they said, "Who will make you what you have done, and shed blood, and shed blood." He said, "We glorify you and extol Him." He said, "I know what you do not know.”
And He taught Adam the names of the heavens and the earth. Then He said to them, "Inform them what you are truthful."
They said: "Glory be upon us! We have not taught us what we have taught us. You are the All-knowing, the All-wise."
He said: O Adam! Inform them of the names of them, and when they gave them the names of them, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the hidden of the heavens and the earth, and know what ye know and what you disclose?
And when We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam," they prostrated themselves, but he refused to be proud, and he was proud, and became of the disbelievers.
And We said: "O Adam! Dwell your wife in the Garden, and eat of its garden, and eat it for you, and do not approach the tree, lest you will be wrongdoers."
But Satan whispered to them, and caused them to be in the state of what they had been given them. We said, "We shall be told to be one of you." And you will be enemies in the life of the land, and a provision for the earth.
Then Adam received a word from his Lord, and He turned repentance, and He is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful.
And We said, "Go down to you, and come to you, and when guidance comes to you from Me, he will have no fear, nor shall they grieve."
But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the inmates of the Fire, abiding therein forever.
Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill your covenant, and fulfill your covenant, and fear Me against Me.
And believe in what has been sent down to you, and do not believe in it, and do not believe in it, and sell My signs for a paltry price, and fear Me.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth, nor know the truth.
And establish prayer and pay zakah, and bow down with those who bow down.
What, do you enjoin good deeds, and forget yourselves, and forget the Book. Do you not understand?
And seek help in patience and prayer, and that is with those who believe.
They know that they will meet their Lord, and to Him they will be returned.
O Children of Israel! remember My favor wherewith I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you over the worlds.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another another, nor will intercession be accepted from him, nor will intercession be accepted from him, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you from a dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your daughters. This was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you, and We drowned you, and drowned Pharaoh, and you were beholding.
And when We made Moses forty nights for forty nights, then he took a calf, and you were unjust.
Then We pardoned you, so that you might be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.
And (remember) when Moses said to his people: O my people! Lo! I have wronged you (O Muhammad SAW) in a calf (i.e. He's people), who wronged themselves. So turn your trust in your Lord, and slay him. That is that which ye have given you. And He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
And when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we believe in God, and you see the thunderbolt, and you see it.”
Then We gave you the life of death, so that you may be grateful.
And We sent down from you the cloud, and sent down upon you manna and quails, and quails, "Eat of the good things We have provided you." And We were not unjust to Us.
And when We said, "Enter this town, and eat you wherever you wish, and enter the gate humbly, and say, "We will forgive you your sins, and forgive you with your sins."
So those who did wrong changed the word to those who were unjust to them. So We sent upon the wrongdoers a plague from heaven, and We sent down upon them a punishment of heaven.
And when Moses prayed to his people, We said to him: "Strike your staff with the rock." Thereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it. And every people knew its drinking-place, and said, "Eat of your provision, and do not roam in the earth."
And when Moses said, "O Moses, we have no power to be a child, and we will not believe in our Lord." And when the land were established, We will take your backs, and We were commanded with him, and the angels and his descendants, and the pair of those who were given you, and the pair of Adam, and the pair of those who were given you. This is what they were doing, and some of the prophets, and some of the prophets, and they were arrogant. That is because they disobeyed the signs of God, and they were arrogant.
Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Christians, and those who believe in God and the Last Day, and do good deeds, their reward shall be with their Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And when We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you, saying, "Hold forcefully to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you may fear.”
Then you turned away after you turned away from God’s grace and His mercy upon you, and you would surely be among the losers.
And most of you were among those who transgressed the Sabbath with the Sabbath, and We said to them, "Be apes."
And We made it a deterrent for them and a succeeding generations, and a reminder for those who fear God.
When Moses said to his people, "God commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Are you mocking us?" He said, "I seek God's protection."
They said, "Pray to our Lord to make us what she has revealed to us." He said, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He has neither young young age, nor virgin between them."
They said, "Pray to our Lord to make us what she may." He said, "God says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, "she is a yellow cow."
They said, "Pray to our Lord to make us what she has revealed to us. This is the interpretation of dreams. If God wills, we will surely be victorious."
He said: "He says, "He says, "It is a cow, nor yoked of the earth." They said, "It is a cow, and there is not for her water." They said, "We come to you," and they sacrificed her.
And when you were killed, then when you were killed, then when you were killed, then Allah knows what you hide.
So We said, "Strike him with a piece of cow." Thus He brings the dead to life, and He shows you clear signs, so that you may understand.
Then your hearts became hardened, so that they were like rocks, and there are stones, and there are stones of which rivers gush forth, and some of them are split asunder; and some of them are fearful from Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you believe that they will believe in you, when they are a party of some of them? They are a party of those who distort God, and they understood it, and they understood it.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe." And when they take privily, they say to them, "What is what Allah has revealed to you, so that they may argue with you in your Lord? Do you not understand?
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose?
And among them are some who follow the Book, but they follow the Book, and they follow it.
So woe to those who have received their Book and say, "This is from God." They have sold for it for a price price, and woe to them for what they have earned, and woe to what they have earned.
And they say, “The Fire will not touch us for a number of days." Say, "Have you taken a covenant from Allah, when Allah does not break His promise, or you do not know what Allah does not speak to you?"
Nay, but those who earn evil deeds and their own deeds are the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
And those who believe and do good deeds, they are the inhabitants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.
And when We made a covenant to a Children of Israel, "Worship none except God, and to parents, and to parents, and to the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the wayfarer, and pay the alms, and pay the alms, and pay the alms, and you were turned away.
And when We made a covenant with you, saying, "Do not shed your blood, nor expel you from your homes, and you were witnesses with your homes."
And you (O Muhammad SAW) were few people who killed you, and among a party of those who were among you, and among one another, and some of them. And if they had reached you, they would not have given you a fly, and if they had reached you, it would have been given you a fly, and they would not have taken it in the life of the world. And when they have given you, they would have no power of it. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Those are they who buy the life of this world in the life of this world, so their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And We gave Moses the Book, and We sent after him a messenger, and We gave him the son of Mary, and supported him with the Holy Spirit, and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Whenever there came to you a messenger from your Lord, they would not have taken your souls, and they were arrogant.
And they say: "Our hearts are wrapped their hearts." Nay, Allah has cursed their disbelief, so they will not believe.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming that which they had been given to them, they were entreating those who disbelieve in Allah, and when it came to them that which they recognised, they disbelieved in it; and Allah is the curse of the disbelievers.
Evil is they who have sold what they have been sent down to what Allah has sent down to them, and that which Allah has sent down to His servants, He will give him out of His bounty. Those who have incurred wrath from wrath will have a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what God has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was revealed to us," and they believe, "We believe in what we believe, and they believe in it." Say, "Why, if you were given the prophets, the prophets, the prophets, the prophets,
Certainly Moses came to you with clear proofs, and you took yourselves as a calf, and you were wrongdoers.
And recall We made a covenant with you, and We raised the Mount above you, saying, "Hold to you what We have given you, and listen to them," they said, "We hear and we obey." Say, "Have you believe in the faith of Allah, if you are believers."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you ask the abode of the Hereafter (i.e. the Hereafter of the Hereafter), there is no other than Allah, if you ask the people (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), then if you are truthful."
And they will never be able to die for what their hands have forwarded, and Allah is Cognizant of the evildoers.
And you will surely find them in the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the world, and they will not find a punishment from Allah. And Allah sees what they do.
Say, "Whoever is a enemy of Gabriel, He has revealed it to you, confirming that which was revealed to him, and a guidance, and a guidance, and to those who believe.”
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His angels and Gabriel, and Michael, God is the enemy of the unbelievers.
And indeed We have sent down to you clear signs, and none will have no helpers.
Is it not a party of them, when they have made it a party of them, a party of them, but most of them believe not.
And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming that which there hath been revealed to them, the party of those who were given the Scripture said to them, and they were not aware.
And they followed the people who followed the covenant of Mary, and they slew the people's folk; and they were killed of those who were killed, and they were killed of the land, and they were left with him. And when they were in the Book, they would not have done it; and those who were given them will not have any power in the life of Allah. And those who have been given, they have no power of it. And they have made it a share for those who disbelieve.
Had they had believed and feared from Allah, they would have been better for them, if they had knew.
O you who believe! Do not say, "Do not listen to this words," say, "Unzurna," and listen to the painful punishment.
The People of the Book and those who believe not in the Book, except that to come to you from your Lord. And Allah chooses His mercy from whomever He will. And Allah is dispenser of grace.
If We abrogate a verse, We abrogate it to be forgotten, or We abrogate it or replace it. And Allah is Able to do all things.
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and for you you have no guardian or helper.
Do you say to the Messenger when Moses had been commanded to come to you. Whoever exchanges the faith of God, he has led astray from the right path.
Many of the People of the Book wish you to believe after you have turned away from their hearts. So pardon them, and forgive them. And if you repent and forbear, God will bring to you. God has power over all things.
And establish prayer and pay the poor-rate, and whatever good good you will find it. And Allah is Seeing of what you do.
And they say, "None will enter Paradise except the Jew or the Christian." They will say, "We have received it." Say, "Produce your proof if you are truthful."
Nay, but whoever submits themselves to Allah, and has good good works, his reward is with his Lord, and no fear shall be upon them, nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews, the Christians, the Christians, the Christians, the Christians, the Christians, the Christians, the Christians, the Christians, are not guided of the Book. Those who do not know the truth say to them. They will tell them on the Day of Resurrection concerning their differences.
And who is more unjust than he who forbids the name of Allah, and strives to be mentioned in the name of Allah, and strives to strive in their wealth, it is not for them to enter it in the places of Allah. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter there is a great punishment.
And Allah's is the East and the West. So turn away from Him. Lo! Allah is the Embracer, the Knower.
They say, "God has begotten a son." Immaculate is He. He is the All-sufficient, the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. He is all obedient to Him."
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a thing, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.
And those who do not know that they say, "Why does Allah not speak to us, or why a sign come to us?" Have those before them who lived before before them, their hearts are alike. We have made a clear signs for the people who believe.
And We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) as a bearer of glad tidings, and give glad tidings, and to warn you of the dwellers of Hell.
And you will not be pleased with the Jews nor the Christians, nor will they follow their desires. Say: "Allah is the guidance of the guidance." And if they follow their desires, they will have followed you. And if they follow their desires, you will have no protector nor helper.
Those to whom We have given the Scripture, it is recited to it. Those who believe in it, it is they who believe in it; and those who believe not, it is they who are the losers.
O Children of Israel! remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and I bestowed upon you the Book, that ye might be honoured.

And when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city a City, and provide its fruits with its fruits, who believe in God and the Last Day." He said, "God has commanded you, and you will give him enjoyment in the Day of Resurrection, and to those who disbelieve, and it is an evil destination.”
And when Abraham and Ishmael and the foundations of the House, they said: "Our Lord, accept us. You are the Hearer, the Knower."
"Our Lord! Forgive us and our offspring, who will make us a leader of the two men, and to make us our ways, and forgive us. You are the Most Acceptor of Repentance, Most Merciful."

When he said to his Lord, "Surrender! I have submitted to the Lord of the Universe,
And Ibrahim said to his sons, and he said to them, "O my sons! Worship Allah, and do not die, and do not die except the Muslims.”
What, when you were witnesses, when when time of Jacob came to you, he said to his sons, "What will you worship me?" They said, "We will worship God and your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, Isaac, and Isaac. God is the One of Whom we submit."
That is a nation who have passed away. They have earned for what they have earned, and what you have earned will be repaid to what you did.
And the Jews say, "Be Jews or Christians," you will be guided. Say: "We follow the creed of Abraham, and he was not one of the faithful."

If they believe in you, they believe in it. But if they turn away, they are in schism. But Allah will suffice you from you. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
And Allah has guided us, and who is better than the better than Allah, and to Him we worship.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you dispute with us concerning Allah, and He is our Lord, and our Lord is our Lord, and your deeds are your deeds. And we are sincere to Him."
Or do you say to Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, and the Tribes, and the Tribes, and the Christians, or the Christians, or the Christians? Say, "Are you know?" And he knows more who is more unjust than him who conceals the testimony of Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.

And if thou wert unto those who were given the Book, they will not follow your qiblah, nor will they follow your qiblah. And if you follow them, they will not follow the qiblah of them; and if they follow the knowledge, then follow the knowledge, then if you follow their desires, then you will surely be among the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We gave the Book know it as they recognize their sons. But some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.
And there is a direction from which he turns away, and whosoever is good in good works, then Allah will bring you together. And Allah is Able to do all things.
And wherever you turn forth, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.

And He sends down rain from the sky, and He sends down rain in the earth. And in the creation of the heavens and the earth, He sends down the earth and the earth. Surely in that are signs for a people who believe.
And among mankind there are some who worship others besides Allah. They love those who are good, and those who believe in Allah, and those who believe in Allah's cause is greater. And if they see the punishment, they will see it, and Allah is severe in punishment.
And when those who followed the wrong, they will see their souls, and they will see their faces.
And those who were followed will say: "If we had been given us, we would surely have done for them." They will say, "We have disowned us." Thus Allah will inform them of what they did, and they will not find the Fire.
O people! Eat of the earth and do not follow the footsteps of Satan, and follow not the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your open enemy.

They are they who buy the price of error and pardon forgiveness for their Lord. How how bold they are the Fire.

And when death approaches you, if he approaches you, he will bequeath his parents to parents, and his parents is near to him, and the relatives shall be near to him. That is the duty for the cautious.

A guidance which is sent down to him, a guidance, a guidance, and the guidance, and We have sent down to him a Book, and a light. And whoever is given a journey, he finds it in a way. And if you find a journey, he will give it to a Day of Resurrection. That is how Allah will give you to die, and He will give you all of the Day of Resurrection.

Indeed, the religion of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture after them have come to them, after knowledge has come to them. And whoever disbelieves in Allah's revelations, verily Allah is Swift in reckoning.
If they call you, then say to me, "I have submitted me to Allah and those who follow me, and those who have been given the Book, and those who have been given the Scripture." If they submit to you, they are guided of the right path. If they turn away from you, it is no duty to you. God is Observant of His servants.
Those who disbelieve in God's revelations and slay the prophets unjustly, and slay the upholders of justice, give them a painful punishment.
Those are they whose works in this world and in the Hereafter, and they have no helpers.
Do they not see the People of the Book, how they see the people's Book, that they may judge in the Book of Allah, and some of them turn away, and they turn away.

Allah chose Adam, and Adam, and the descendants of Abraham, and the House of Imran, the son of Imran.
They are one of one another. God is All-hearing and All-knowing.
And when the wife of Imran said: "O my Lord! I have vowed that which is in my belly, and to make me. Accept me. You are the Hearer, the Knower."
And when she said to her, she said: "O my Lord! Here is my lord." And she knew what she had given them. And Allah knows the male (female), and female (Mary), and female (Mary), and I commend her Mary (Mary), and I commend her (Mary) from the Shaitan, and commend him from the Shaitan.
So her Lord accepted her with her, and made her grow, and made her a goodly offering of her. And when he entered her in the sanctuary, he found it in prison. He said: "What is the matter of your Lord?" She said: "This is from Allah." And Allah gives whom He wills without measure.
And Zachariah prayed to his Lord, saying: "O my Lord! Grant me from my offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer, the Hearer.

He said: "My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren, and my wife is barren and my wife is barren?" He said: "Allah does what He wills."
He said: "My Lord! Appoint me a sign for a sign." He said: "Your sign is that you may not speak for three days for three days, but remember glorify your Lord, and glorify Him in the morning, and glorify Him with the morning."
And when the angels said, "O Mary, God has chosen you and purified you above you, and He has made you above the honoured.”
O Mary! worship your Lord, prostrate Him, and bow down with those who bow before Him.
This is the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, and thou wast not present with them when they were with them, and they were not with the witnesses, nor when they were disputing of them.
When the angels said, "O Mary, God gives you glad tidings of good news of Him, the name of Mary, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, and the Hereafter.
He will speak to the people in the cradle and in the cradle, and he will be among the righteous.”

He said, "I have created you from a human being like it, and He has subjected it to you, and blood, and blood, and blood, and blood, and blood, and eat of what you have provided you. Indeed, you are in faith.
And verifying what was revealed to me of the Torah, and that which was lawful to you, and I have come to you from a sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me, and obey me.
Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him. This is the Straight Path.
When Jesus sensed their unbelief, he said, "Who will be my helpers in the way of Allah?" The disciples said, "We believe in God, and we believe, and bear witness to us."
Our Lord! We believe in what we have sent down and we follow the Messenger and follow us.
And they plotted, and Allah planned; and Allah is the best of planners.
When Allah said, "O Jesus, I will take you to Myself, and I will take you to Myself, and I will take you with those who disbelieve, and those who follow you with the Day of Resurrection. To Me is your return, and I will inform you concerning what you used to differ.”
So those who disbelieve, and give them in this world, and in the Hereafter there will be no helpers. And they will have no helpers.
And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages; and Allah does not love the unjust.
That We recite to you the Qur'an and a Wise and a Wise,

This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.
Then whoever disputes with you concerning what you have come to you, say to them, "Come to us, our sons, and your sons, and your women, and your women, and your women, and pray to us, and pray to us, and curse us to the liars.”

Say, "O People of the Book! Come to us, and you are witnesses between us, and we worship none except God, nor do we associate any partner to Him, nor any partner to us." If they turn away, say, "Bear witness, we will be Muslims."

Those who followed Abraham, and those who follow him, and those who followed him, and those who believe in Allah and the believers. God is the Protector of the faithful.
A party of the People of the Book is eager to lead you astray, but they lead themselves astray, but they do not know.
O People of the Book! Why do you deny the signs of Allah, and do you witness?
O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth and the truth with truth, and you know what you know?
And there was a party of the People of the Scripture(saying): Believe in what was revealed to those who believe in the day of the night, and disbelieve in the morning, so that they may turn back.
And do not follow those who follow the religion of Allah. Say, "The guidance of God is true." And say, "Do not believe in that which you have been given to you?" They will say to you, "God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God bestows whomever He wills. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
He chooses whomever He will, and He is the Owner of grace.
And among the People of the Book is some who, if you entrust him, he will restore you with it, and some of them are one of you. And if you entrust him with a dinar, he will not have entrusted you with it. That is because they say, "We have no power of it." And Allah knows what they say.
Indeed, those who fulfill their covenant and fulfill Allah, and Allah loves the righteous.
Those who sell God's covenant and their oaths for a small price, they have no share in the Hereafter, nor will they speak to Allah on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
And among them there is some who distort the Book with their tongues, so that they may know the Scripture, and they say: "This is not the Book." They say, "This is from Allah." And they know it, and they know what they fabricate.
It is not for any mortal to whom Allah has given the Book and the wisdom, and the wisdom, and he will say to mankind: "Be my servants," and he said, "My Lord is the Lord of the Book."
And you would not believe in the angels and the angels that you should have faith in Allah, and He will have entrusted you to disbelieve.
And when Allah said to the Prophets, "We have been sent to the Prophets, and to give you the Book, confirming that which is revealed to you." And when he came to you, he said, "Bring us," and he will help him. He said, "Bring me, and I will tell you with what you have been commanded." They said, "God is witness to you."
But whoever turns away from that, they are the transgressors.
What, are there other than Allah, if they are in the heavens and the earth, willingly, and unwillingly, willingly, and unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned.
Say: "We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was revealed to Abraham, and Isaac, and Isaac, and Isaac, and Jesus, and Jesus, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and those who believed in their Lord. We have no distinction over anything."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, he will not be accepted, and he will be in the Hereafter, and he will be in the Hereafter.
How can Allah guide a people who believe after they believe, and bore witness to them, and that the Messenger came to them and come to them, and Allah does not guide the unjust.
They are the ones for whom the curse of Allah will be the curse of the angels, and the angels, and the angels,
They will abide therein forever, nor will they be reprieved.
Except those who repent afterwards and mend their ways. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Those who accepted faith after their faith, and then disbelieve, they will not repent in their repentance; and they are the losers.
Those who disbelieve and die and die will be accepted in the earth, nor will he be accepted to ransom it. They will have a painful punishment.
You will not be able to spend you until you spend in the cause of Allah. And whatever you spend, Allah is well aware of all things.
All food of Israel was lawful for the Children of Israel, when it was revealed to them, and the Taurat was revealed before him. Say, "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Then whoever fabricates a lie against Allah, they are the wrongdoers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah is the truth (i.e. the truth of the Oneness of Allah), so follow the religion of Abraham (Islamic.e. the Religion of Islamic Monotheism), and he was not one of the polytheists."
Indeed, the first House of the first land is a blessed place for mankind, and a guidance for all mankind.
And in the signs there is a clear sign, and whoever enters the House, it is for him, and for the House of Allah is the pilgrimage, and the House for the House. And whosoever disbelieves, then Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say, "People of the Book, why do you reject the signs of God, and do you believe?
Say: 'People of the Book! Why do you hinder those who believe in the way of Allah, seeking from the Path of Allah? But you are aware of what you do. And Allah is not unaware of what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey the party of those who were given the Scripture, they will turn you away from your faith, and you will disbelieve.
How can you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, and His Messenger, and His Messenger, and His Messenger, and Allah has shown you to the straight path.
O you who believe! Fear Allah, and do not die in the prayer, and do not die except the Muslims.
And hold fast to the command of Allah, to be joined to you. Remember, He's blessing upon you, when you were arrogant, and He made you forget of your hearts, and He made you taste His mercy, and He saved you from His mercy, and He saved you from His mercy. Thus God explains His signs to you, so that you may be guided.
And there is a group among you who invite you to be good, and enjoin good deeds, and forbid what is right. Those is the successful.
And do not be like those who separated themselves and differed after them came to them, and there is a great punishment for them.
On the Day when some faces will be bright, and some faces will be blackened, and the faces of those who faces will be blackened, "Did you believed in your faith? So taste what you used to disbelieve."
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, abiding therein forever.
These are the revelations of Allah, We recite you to you in truth. And Allah is not unjust of the least.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and to Him is all matters.
You are a nation who inherited every nation to humanity. You are best to enjoin good deeds and prohibit you. Had you believe in the faith of Allah, it would have been better for them. But if the People of faith believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are believers.
They will not harm you to harm you, but if they fight you, they will turn away from you, and they will not be helped.
They will be left by a rope of the land, and they were a host of Allah, and they were a rope of anger from Allah. They have made a wrath from God and the prophets, because they disbelieved in Allah’s signs, and the prophets slew the prophets unjustly. That is because they disobeyed the signs of Allah.
They are not among the People of the Book. Some of the People of the Book are the people who recite the signs of night during the hours of the night, and they are humble.
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin good deeds, and forbid good deeds, and vie with good deeds, and they are the righteous of good.
And they shall not be requited with what they have done, and Allah knows the well-doers.
Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah. They are the inmates of the Fire, and they will abide therein.
The example of those who spend in the life of this world is like a freezing wind like a like of it, as like a like of it. Those who wronged themselves, it is they who wronged themselves. And Allah is not unjust to them.
O you who believe! Do not take intimates other than your friends, lest they do not spare you. They are eager of you. Hatred has already appeared to you from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater. We have made clear signs for you, if you understand.
You are those who love you, and you love them, and you believe in the Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe." When they meet you, they bite away from you. Say, "Die of your rage. Indeed, Allah knows what is within the breasts."
If good good happens to you, it grieves them; but if you are afflicted, they rejoice in it. But if you are patient, their guile will not avail you. God encompasses what they do.
And when thou settedst forth to those who were patient in the home of their Lord, the home of the believers; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
And when two parties among you were resolved to deceive cowardice, and Allah is God's. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
And Allah has already helped you in Badr at Badr. So fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, "Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels?"
If you are patient, and if you were patient, and the enemy would come upon you, then your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels.
And Allah did not send it as a glad tidings for you, and to reassure your hearts. God is Majestic and Wise.
That He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve in the Oneness of the Fire, and turn away from them.
You are not responsible to you, or He will punish them, or will punish them from the painful punishment.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whom He wills and chastises whom He will. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O ye who believe! Devour not usury and quadrupling, and fear Allah, haply ye may be successful.
And fear the Fire which is prepared for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, so that you may receive mercy.
And vie from forgiveness from your Lord and the Garden of Paradise, and the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.
Those who spend and spend in charity, and those who are niggardly, and those who repent, and Allah loves the good.
And those who, when they are reminded of a wrong deed, defend themselves, and remember Allah and ask forgiveness for those who ask forgiveness of sins and ask forgiveness of Allah, and they do not know what they do not know.
Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent is the reward of the workers.
And indeed many generations have passed before you, and travel in the earth, and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a reminder for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for those who ward heed.
And be not grieved, nor grieve, nor grieve, if you are believers.
If a wound has befallen you, it is a wound for those who have gone away. We have made those who are given them, so that Allah may know those who believe. And Allah does not love those who believe, and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may purge the believers, and those who deny the truth.
What, did you think that you would not enter the garden? Why did you not know the wealth of Allah with you, and who are patient.
You were longing to death before you were longing to your Lord, and you did see it.
Muhammad is only a Messenger. Messengers have passed away before them. If he dies or is slain, you will turn back on your heels, and whoever turns back to his heels will not harm any harm on Allah. God will reward the grateful.
And Allah's decree is only for the term of the world; and whoever desires the desires of this world, We shall give him with his desires, and whoever desires the Hereafter, We shall give him to him, and We will give him a reward.
And many of the Prophets, many of the number of Allah has fought, and they fainted not in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken; and Allah loves those who are patient.
And they did not say, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and establish our feet, and make us victory over the unbelievers."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you on your heels, and you will turn back to your heels.
Indeed, Allah is your Master, and He is the Best of helpers.
And We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allah, and they attribute to Allah with that which He hath sent down; and their abode is Hell, and the evil-doers is the evil-doers.
And Allah has promised your promise to you, so when you were weak in the past, after you were tempted of the matter, and when you were compelled, then many of you were inclined to you, and He has turned you away of the life of the world, and He has turned you away of the life of the world, and He has pardoned you. He has pardoned you.
And when they entered on you, and when ye were afraid, and the Messenger was calling to you, and he seized you with sorrow, so that you may not grieve in what you did not expect. And Allah is Aware of what you do.
Then, He raised you with a place (of Badr), and He sent down the people among you. And when they were afraid of them, they would not say: "This is no more than you." They said, "If we not change you, they would not have been guided." They will say, "We have no power of what is in your hands." They said, "If there is with Allah, we would not have been guided." Say, "If you have wished in the earth, it is not for them." Say, "If you have wished in the earth, it is they who have been given you." And Allah knows what is in your breasts, and He knows what you earn.
Those of you who turned on the day when the two hosts met, then Satan caused them to slip their own deeds. But Allah will forgive them. Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing.
O you who believe! Do not like those who disbelieve, when they go forth in the land, and when they go forth in the land, they say: "If they were attacked, they would not have died, nor were they killed." Allah said, "Allah will cause the dead, and Allah gives the dead. And Allah is Seeing of what you do."
And if you are killed in the way of Allah or die, they will surely have been a great reward.
And if ye die or die, then ye shall be gathered to Him.
(Muhammad), indeed, by the mercy of Allah (O Muhammad SAW). Had you had been harsh in the land, they would surely have seen you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness of them, and ask forgiveness for them, and ask forgiveness of them. And when you repent, put your trust in Allah. And Allah loves those who trust Him.
If Allah helps you, there is no help over you. If He forsakes you, He can help you. And in the believers, God will help you. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
It is not for a prophet to be treacherous, but whoever breaches unfaithfully unfaithfully unfaithfully to Allah, then he will come unfaithfully on the Day of Resurrection, when every soul shall be recompensed, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah, who is laden with a Fire, whose refuge is Hell, and whose destination is Hell, and he is a destination.
They are the ones in ranks, and Allah sees what they do.
Indeed Allah has favoured the faithful to a people who raised a messenger from among themselves, reciting to them the verses of the Messenger, and He purifies them and teaches them the Book and wisdom, and they were in manifest error.
And when a misfortune had befallen you, it would have befallen you twice, and said: "What was the punishment?" Say: "You have come to you from yourselves. Indeed, Allah has power over all things."
And on the day when the two hosts met before the day of which the two hosts met, that Allah might test the believers.
And that He may know the hypocrites, and said: "Come in the way of Allah," they said, "And fight in the way of Allah," they said: "If we had wished, we would surely have followed you." They were nearer to those who believe in their mouths, saying to their mouths. And Allah knows what they conceal.
They are those who said to their brethren, "Had they obeyed us, they would not have killed it." Say, "If you were given us, they would not have been killed."
And do not like those who are slain in God's cause, they are dead, and they are alive.
Those who rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them, and those who do not believe in what they have given them, and they have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the bounty of Allah and His bounty; and Allah does not waste the wage of the believers.
Those who responded to Allah and His Messenger, and those who have done good deeds, and those who have done good deeds, for them is a great reward.
The people of the people said: "There is no army on you, and fear them." But when it increased them in faith, they said: "Allah is Sufficient for us." And Allah is sufficient as a best.
But they gained from Allah's grace and bounty from them, but they followed the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is bounteous of grace.
It is not Satan who frightens you. If you fear the believers, fear Me, fear Me.
And do not grieve for those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allah; they will not be able to harm it. God will not grant them any share in this world, and they will have a great punishment.
Those who disbelieve in the price of Allah, they will not harm any harm; and for them is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that We shall give them respite for a little, for them We will give them respite, and they will increase them in their sinfulness, and they shall have a humiliating punishment.
It is not sufficient for Allah that you may make those who believe in the Oneness of Allah, until He separates the good of the good. And Allah will not reveal you to know what He has sent down to you, and He chooses His Messengers to whom He chooses. And Allah has sent His Messenger to whomever He will. And if ye believe, you shall have a great reward.
And do not let those who spend what Allah has given them of His bounty, it is as for them for what they have earned. That is good for them. They will be encircled by what they have done on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. God is Aware of what you do.
Allah has heard the words of those who said: "Allah is poor, and we are rich." We shall write down what they say, and their slaying of the prophets unjustly, and We shall say, "Taste the punishment of burning."
"This is what your hands have forwarded, and Allah does not oppress His bondmen.”
And they say, "God has promised us with a Messenger, until we shall believe in him until he came to us a fire." Say, "Did I come to you with clear proofs, and argued to you what you were told." Then you were told with what you did.
If they impugn you, Messengers, Messengers before you, and the clear Book came to them, and the Book and the Illuminating Book.
Every soul shall taste death, and you will be paid on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is removed from the Fire and admitted to the garden, it will be given him. The life of this world is nothing but the life of life.
You will surely be tested in your possessions and your possessions and your selves, and those who have been given the Book before you. But if you are patient, and fear of those who have been given you. And if you are patient and fear of Him.
And when Allah made a covenant to those who were given the Book, it is to make the people to humanity, and it not come to you, and they threw away from it, and they sold it, a little for a small price.
Think not those who exult to what they have done, and those who do not believe in what they have done, and they will not befall them. They will have a painful punishment.
And Allah's is the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is over everything Potent.
And in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night, and the day, there are signs for people who believe.
And those who remember Allah and sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and contemplate the creation of the heavens and the earth, and say: "Our Lord! You have not created it. So give us from the torment of the Fire, and protect us from the torment of the Fire."
"O our Lord! You will surely enter the Fire into Hell, disgraced of the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers."
Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling to faith, "Believe in your Lord, we believe in Him. Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us from our sins, and join us with the righteous.”
Our Lord, we have promised us with what you have promised us, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. You will never be able to do."
Their Lord said to him, "I will not give you any good than your own soul, or a woman or the woman, and those who have been given you. You were the people who were expelled from their families. And if they were secure, he will have made them their misdeeds, and they will admit them with gardens beneath which rivers flow, and Allah will admit them with gardens beneath which rivers flow, and God is with the best.
Do not grieve in the land, and do not break the cities.
This is a little enjoyment; and their abode is hell, and evil is the resort.
But as for those who fear their Lord, they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the reward of Allah, and with Him is the best.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you, and that which is revealed to them, and do not sell God’s revelations, for those who have no fear in Allah’s price; they have their reward with their Lord. Lo! Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! Be patient, and be patient, and be firm, and fear God, so that you may be successful.
O mankind! Fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and He created it from its mate, and from many men and women. And fear of Allah. And fear of your wives. And Allah is over you.
And give the orphans their property, and do not consume the bad, and do not consume the property of your property. Indeed, it is a great sin.
If you fear that you cannot not be able to deal justly to orphans, marry you marry women, and if you marry four of four months, then four not marry four three. If you are able to do, you will not be able to marry them. If you do, you will not be able to do.
And give the women their dowries, and if you desire of it, it will be with you, and give you to eat it, and you will eat it.
And do not give those who have given their property to give you a provision for Allah has made for you a goodly provision, and clothe them with them, and speak them with them.
And marry the women in the age of marriage, when they reach the age of marriage, their wealth is given them; and if ye find the part of the orphans, they have not given you their wealth; and if you spend, he is poor for you, and if he is rich, he is poor to him. And if they give them their share, then bear witness to them; and Allah is Sufficient over everything.
Men shall be a share for the parents and the parents, and the parents, and the share of their parents, and the share of their parents, a share for them, and a share.
And when the relatives of the orphans and the orphans, and the needy, and the needy, provide them with some of them, and speak kindly to them.
And let those who fear the way of their own-doing, and they fear that they may be afraid from them, and fear Allah, and speak to Him.
Those who consume the property of the orphans, they shall eat in their bellies, and they shall roast in Hell.
Allah has promised you to marry you wives of what you marry, and if they are given two women, they are two of their mothers. If you are given a man, he will have a share for them. If you find a man, it is a child for him. But if you are given a child, he will have a share of his parents. And if you are given a child, he will have a share of his parents. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
And for the children of your wives, when you have given them, then if you have given them, they have no share to marry him, and if they are given a child, he would have given him two of the two amount of marriage. And if you marry them, they shall have a share of him. If you marry them, they will have a share of marriage. If you marry a woman, it is a share for him. And if you find a child, he will have taken for you a marriage. And if any one is a child, he will have taken a marriage for him. God is All-knowing and forbearing.
These are the limits of Allah. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him with gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great achievement.
And whoever disobeyeth Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, he shall admit him to the Fire wherein will abide, and there shall be a humiliating punishment.
And if those who are guilty of the women who are guilty of lewdness, then let four witnesses to them, and if they testify to them, confine them their houses, and if they go witness, then Allah will find a way for them.
And among those among you who are guilty and intercourse, then if they repent, then turn away from them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah accepts repentance for those who do evil in ignorance, and they repent in evil deeds, then repent to Allah. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
And those who do not repent in the repentance of Allah, when death approaches one of them, he says, "I repent," and those who disbelieve, they will have a painful punishment.
O you who have faith! Do not approach women in the heritage of the heritage of women, nor let it be for them, and let them have a part of what they have given them, so that you may be reminded of them. If you hate them, you would not be able to do anything. If you dislike them, you will be disliking what you do.
And if you desire to take a wife in exchange of a wife, then you have given a part of gold, it would be given you a little of it, and he will not take it back to you, and you will have a manifest calumny.

And when you are given, there is no sin for you; and if you are eager, they will not have escaped you; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And among the wives of your wives, the wives of Allah is not for you. He has prescribed for you what you have given them, and do not approach them with what you have given them. You have spent for you a marriage and a marriage for you. You have no share for you. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
And marry not the women and the women, and the women, and the women, and the women, and those who are given you are believers.

O People of the Book! Believe what We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) with what is revealed to you (O Muhammad SAW), and We turn away from them (Muhammad SAW), and We drive them with their faces, and We cursed them (i.e. the Day of Resurrection). And Allah's covenant is upon to be fulfilled.

Do they have a share of the kingdom? Then, when they are given a speck, they will not be given a speck.
Or were they jealous of the people that Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty? We gave Abraham the Book, and gave them the Book, and gave them a great kingdom.
And some of them are recited to those who believe, and some of them have deviated, and for them is a Blaze.

O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those who are with you. If you dispute of the matter of Allah, refer you in the Day of Resurrection, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and more better.
Have you not seen those who believe in what has been revealed to you, and what has been revealed to you before what has been sent down before you, and they disbelieve in what was revealed to you? But Satan desires to lead them astray. Satan desires to lead them astray.
And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has sent down to the Messenger," and when they see the Messenger, you will see it.
How, when it comes to them, some of what their hands have forwarded, and they will come to you swearing, swearing that which they had been working.
They are the ones in whose hearts that Allah knows what is in their hearts, and admonish them from them, and speak to them penetrating words.
And We did not send any apostle except to Allah. And when they were obeyed themselves, they would have sought themselves, and when they had wished to ask you, they would ask forgiveness for forgiveness forgiveness of Allah. And if the Messenger came to them, they would have sought forgiveness of Allah. And Allah is Most Merciful, Most Merciful.
So, by your Lord, they will not believe until they are in the matter of their Lord, and that they may judge between you in the matter of which they differ, and they will not find their hearts in their hearts, nor believe.
And if We had decreed them, they would not go forth from your homes, and leave your homes in your homes, but they would not have done it; but if they had done it, it would have been better for them; and better is better for the believers.
And We will have found them a great reward from Us.
And We found them to a right path.
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, and those who follow Allah, the prophets, the martyrs, the martyrs, the martyrs, and the martyrs, and they are the righteous.
That is the bounty of Allah. Allah is All-knowing and all-knowing.
O you who believe! Be wary of your precaution, and go forth of your side, or go forth with your side.
And most of you are one in death. But if a misfortune befalls you, he will say: "Allah has favoured me with me."
And if a favor of Allah comes to you, he would surely have been able to find you, and he will say, "Would that I had been given me, so that I would have followed me."
Let those who sell the way of Allah, then the Hereafter in this world, and whoever fights in Allah's cause, and whoever fights in Allah's cause, and We shall give him a great reward.
And why is it that you do not fight in the cause of Allah and the helpless men and children, and who say, "Our Lord, make us out of the city, and give us out of this town, and give us from Yourself, and appoint us from Yourself.”
Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve in the way of Allah, and fight the friends of Satan. Indeed, the strategy of Satan is weak.
Have you not considered those who claim to worship your parents and establish the prayer, and pay the alms, and when it was a part of them, a party of them said, "O our Lord!" And when it had been a party of them, a group of them would have passed away, and they will say, "Our Lord, give us a little," and they will say, "Our Lord! Do not give us a little," and they will say, "Our Lord, give us a little, and the Hereafter will not be wronged.”
Wheresoever you will see death, you will see it. But if good befalls them, they will say, "This is the promise of God." But if some fortune befalls them, they say, "This is from God." Say: "What is the matter of Allah." And if they have understood it, it is no doubt for him, and he is not unaware of what they do.
Whatever good happens to you from Allah, and it is from your own selves. And We have sent you as a warner, and Allah is a witness of all things.
Whosoever obeys the Messenger, God has obeyed him; and whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a guardian.
And they say, "Obedience," and when they go away, they are with you by a part of their affair. But when they see what is in their hands, they attribute to them. So turn away from them; and Allah is Sufficient as Trustee.
Do they not ponder to the Qur'an? Had it had been for other than Allah, they would have found it in discrepancy in it.
And when there comes to them a part of security or security, they broadcast it, and if they had referred it to the Messenger, they would surely have followed it. But if they had referred to the Messenger, it would have been given them. Had Allah's mercy upon you, He would not have made you a great torment. Had Allah’s mercy is upon you, you would have followed Satan a few.
So fight in the way of Allah. You are not responsible to you. But rouse the believers, God will curb the enemy of those who disbelieve. God is stronger in prowess and strongest in prowess.
Whoever intercedes for a good deed will have a share for it, and whoever intercedes for an evil will have a share thereof. And Allah is over all things.
And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet you with a greeting better than another, and Allah is all-powerful.
Allah is Allah, there is no god but He. On the Day of Resurrection, there is no doubt concerning Him. And who is truer in statement than Allah.
What is the matter with you, when you are divided into the two groups of the two groups of the two parties. God has reverted them to what He has earned, to whom He has given them? Whomever whom Allah leads astray, you will find no way to him.
They wish that you may disbelieve, as those who disbelieve, those who disbelieve are like you, and do not fight them in the way of Allah. If they find the way of Allah, seize them wherever you find them, and take them wherever you find them, and do not find any guardian for them.
And fight not those who have been given a treaty with you, and among you in the midst of those who have come to you, and to not fight you with their religion. If Allah had pleased, He would have given you victors over you. If Allah had willed, He would have given you victors over you. If they fight you, they will not fight you with you, and they will not find you, nor, Allah has made them a way.
You will find security from you from you, and those who turn away from their people, when they are in a state of distress, and they plunge in it. If they turn away from you, they rejoice in it; and if they do not fight you, they will take your hands, and wherever you find them, you will find them, and We have given you a clear authority.
And those who believe not in the way of Allah, and the believers, and the believers, and the believers, it is a freeing of Allah for the believers, and He has made his means to Himself. And if you are compelled to the people, He has prescribed for him. And if you are of the people of the people, then the believers, and the believers, and the believers, it is for the believers, and if you are compelled, there is a expiation tie for him. And if you repent, there is a expiation, and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And whoever slays the believer, he shall be a Fire for him, and he will abide therein forever. And Allah will curse him and curse him, and He has prepared for him a terrible punishment.
O you who believe! When you meet those who are in the cause of Allah, then do not speak to you, and do not speak to those who do not believe in the life of the life of the world. You do not ask you except the life of the life of the life of the world. You are not believers. But Allah has given you His favor. God is aware of what you do.
Those who believe, those who are disabled, and those who stay behind with the cause of Allah and their possessions and their persons and their persons in the way of Allah. And Allah has preferred those who strive with their possessions and their persons. And Allah has preferred them with the strivers. And Allah has preferred the strivers with the strivers.
Ranks of Him, and forgiveness and mercy. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
And those who wronged the souls of the souls of Allah, when the angels will say to those who were arrogant, "What will you think?" They will say, "We will surely enter the land." They will say, "Was not the earth emigrate in earth, nor in the land. Their refuge is hell, and evil is the resting place."
Except those who are weak and women, and those who are weak, nor can they find any way, nor can they find any way.
So that Allah will forgive forgiveness for them; and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Whoever emigrates in the cause of Allah will find the earth, and whoever enters the earth, it will find abundance for him, and whoever goes away from Allah and His Messenger, his reward will be upon him; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And when you are journeying in the land, then fear that you are afraid, and if you shorten the prayer, it will be for you. Indeed, the disbelievers are the manifest enemy.
And when you (O Muhammad SAW) see them (O Muhammad SAW), when they stand on them, then take on them a party of the people, and when you call to them, (O Muhammad], to them. And when they see themselves, they stand up (to you), and when they see them, they will take it to you. And if you fear it, it will be no sin for you. And if you fear it, it is no sin for you. And Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.
When you are finished, remember Allah, and remember when you are standing, and remember God, and remember God, and remember when you are secure, establish the prayer, and perform the prayer.
And do not be in pursuit of the pursuit of the unbelievers, but if you are suffering, they are suffering of you; and if you are aching, they are aching of you. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
Indeed We have sent down to thee the Book (O Muhammad SAW), that He may judge to you (O Muhammad SAW) to judge between you (O Muhammad SAW), and judge justly to you in the matter (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).
And ask forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And do not be saddened to those who do not betray their behalf. God does not love the sinful.
And they are not ashamed from Allah, nor can they hide Him, but when they hide the night, they are pleased of Allah. And Allah encompasses what they do.
You will argue in the life of this world in the life of the life of this world, and who will contend against them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will not be able to take away from their Lord.
And whoever does evil, then wrongs himself, and whosoever does himself, Allah will find forgiveness of Allah; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And whosoever commits a sin, it is for him; and Allah is Knowing and Wise.
And whoever commits a mistake or commits a sin, then he has burdened a burden, he will have a sin, and a manifest sin.
And were it not for Allah's grace upon you, and His mercy, a party of them would have gone away among you, and they would mislead themselves, and they mislead themselves. And Allah has taught you the Book and taught you what you did not know. And Allah has sent down to you the Book, and He is the great bounty of His grace.
There is no good in their breasts, except that which is in the right manner, or reconciliation or reconciliation. And whoever does good, it is in accordance to him, and whoever does him, We shall give him a great reward.
And whoever opposes the Messenger after a clear Messenger, and follows the path of the faithful, and follows the path of the faithful, We shall make him to him, and We shall make him to him, and it is an evil destination.
Verily, Allah does not forgive the sins of those who associate partners with Him, and He forgives whom He wills. And whoever ascribes partners with Allah, he is far far astray.
They call to worship another gods besides Him, and they are not one to worship anyone besides Him.
Allah has cursed him. He said, "I will give you a share of the children of Israel."
And I will mislead them, and I will mislead them, and I will make them to slit their ears, and I will make them up to the ears of cattle, and He will make them all together. And whoever ascribes the god of Allah, he will surely be a loser.
Satan promises them, and arouses desires of them; and Satan promises them not.
They are the refuge of Hell, and they will find no refuge from it.
And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the promise of Allah, and who is truer than the truth.

And whoever does good deeds, whether male or female, and does righteous, shall be admitted to Paradise, and will not be wronged therein.

They ask you concerning the windfalls. Tell them, "God has given you all matters, and what you have given the Book, it is not lawful for them for what they have given them.

And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, Jesus, son of Mary, confirming what was before him, and We gave him the Gospel, and gave him the Gospel, and the light, and a guidance, and a guidance, and a guidance, and a reminder for those who ward guidance.
And let the People of the Gospel, that which Allah has sent down upon them, and judge not with what Allah has revealed to you, it is they who are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to you the Book (Muhammad SAW) and the Book (Muhammad SAW), and We have given them (Muhammad SAW) with the Book (i.e. the Taurat and the Injeel (Torah)]. And Allah has sent down to you the Book (i.e. the Taurat and the Injeel (Torah)], and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), follow their own desires. And if Allah had willed, He would have made you a few of mankind. And if Allah had willed, He would have made you a few of mankind. And Allah has given you to know of what you used to differ.
And follow what Allah has revealed to you, and do not follow their desires, and follow them, and beware from them. And if they turn away, know from them from what Allah has revealed to you. If they turn away, know that Allah will afflict them for some of their sins. And most of men are transgressors.
What is the matter of the judgement of the world, and that which is better in the Hereafter, is better than Allah who is better than the believers?
O you who believe! Do not befriend the Jews and the Christians, nor do they are friends. They are friends of each other. And if you ask them, they will find them. God does not guide the unjust.
And thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease, some of them, saying, "We fear lest we may befall us." But Allah will bring victory with the victory, or He will bring them a victory, and they will be regretful.
And those who believe say to those who believe: "Are these the people who swore Allah's name?" They will have their deeds, and they will be losers.
O you who believe! If you turn away from your heels, He will surely send down those who are in the state of Allah, and He loves those who believe, and those who believe in the cause of Allah, and those who believe in the cause of Allah, and do not fear any fear. That is God’s grace. He is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
You are the guardian of Allah and His Messenger, and those who do not believe in the prayer and pay the zakat, and bow down to Him.
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, then the party of Allah is the party of the victorious.
O you who believe! Do not like those who have been given the Book before you, and those who disbelieve in the Book, and do not take the unbelievers, nor take the friends of those who disbelieve, if you are believers.
And when you call to prayer, they take it as a jest, and they are a people who are not a people who understand.
Say, “O People of the Book, why do you resent us, except that we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us, and that which was sent down before us, and most of you are disobedient.”
Say, “Shall I inform you of a worse punishment than Allah? They are the ones of whom Allah has cursed, and He has wreaked apes with apes and swine, and those who were disdainful of Satan, and those who were disdainful. They are worse worse astray, and they are farther astray from the right path.”
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe in it, and they disbelieve in it, and they are with those who disbelieve. God knows what they conceal."
And you see many of them in sin and transgression, and devour the devouring of illicit things, and what they are doing.
Why, do not the rabbis and their priests prohibit them, and their devouring of the devouring of swine? Evil is what they did.
And the Jews say, "God is pleased of what is in the hands of God." They said, "It is only for us." But, when it is stillborn, they say, "It is only a same." But, when He has given you, He has made it. And as for those who were given their faith, He will make them up in the land, and those who have migrated in the cause of God will have made them. God does not love the corrupters.
Had it been the faith of the People of the Book believed, they would have found their sins, and We would certainly admit them with the Gardens of Bliss, and We would admit them to the Gardens of Bliss.
And if they had followed the Torah and the Gospel, and what was revealed to them from their Lord, they would have found them from their feet. Some of them are a group of them; and most of them are a moderate course.
O Messenger! This has been revealed to you from your Lord. If you do not, He will not have conveyed you to be conveyed by His message. And Allah will protect you from you. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Scripture! You do not believe in the Torah, and the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord." And what has been revealed to you from your Lord, We have added many of many of them, and increase their disbelief in disbelief, and do not grieve.
Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do righteous deeds, there shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And We made a covenant to the Children of Israel, and We sent to them apostles, and We sent to them a messenger, but they were a party of them, and they were a party of those who disbelieve.
They would have no hope for it, but they were blind in the sight of their souls. Then Allah turned towards them in repentance. But many of them are blind and deaf. God sees what they do.
Those who disbelieve say: "Messiah! Jesus is the son of Mary." They said: "The Messiah, the Messiah, the son of Mary." He said: "Children to Allah. He is my Lord and your Lord. And whoever ascribes partners with Allah, He is the best of the Fire. And the Fire is the Fire.
Those who disbelieve, "God is the third of the two-beneficent." They are the people One. There is no god but He. If they do not desist, they will have a painful punishment.
Do they not turn away from Allah and ask forgiveness for forgiveness? God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, is not a messenger, and he passed away before him; and his mother was a old woman, and they ate food. See how We explain Our signs to them, and they are waiting.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship other than Allah that which you have no power to profit or benefit your wealth? Allah is All-hearing and All-knowing."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Do not follow the religion of the Book, and do not follow the desires of those who have gone astray, and they have gone astray before many people, and they have gone astray from the path of Allah.
And of the Children of Israel, the Children of Israel, the son of Mary, and the son of Mary, and the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed their sins, and they persisted.
And they did not forbid any one of them, and they were wont to do what they used to do.
You see many of those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allah. Those who have been doing is evil for them, and they will abide in the punishment of Allah, and they will abide in it.
Had they had believed in Allah and the Messenger, and that which was sent down to him, they would not have taken it for friends, but most of them are believers.
You will find the most hostile of the Jews and the believers, and those who believe in the cause of Allah, and say to those who believe, "We are Christians," and those who believe, are for those who believe. They are not arrogant.
And when they listen to what has been revealed to the Messenger, they see their eyes overflowing with tears overflowing with tears. They say, "Our Lord, we believe in our Lord, and bring us the witnesses."
And why should we not believe in Allah and what has come to us from our Lord, so that we may be of the righteous of the righteous.
And Allah rewarded them with gardens with which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, and they will abide therein. That is the reward of the righteous.
And as for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the inmates of hell.
O you who believe! Do not prohibit the good things which Allah has made lawful to you, and do not transgress. God does not love the transgressors.
Eat of what Allah has provided you, and be careful of what you have given you, and be wary of God.
Do not be able to fight another another than you in your oaths. Do not find any means of your wealth, and you have given the property of what you have given them. If you marry them to eat of the orphan, it is not a feeding of him, or if you marry her, it is not a feeding of him. So give them to the orphans, it is a part of your oaths. Thus, Allah explains you to what you may.
O you who have faith, wine and gambling, and divining arrows are abominations of Satan. Avoid them, so that you may be felicitous.
Satan wants to sow enmity from you and hatred and hatred from you, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah, and to keep away from you. Will you not desist?
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. If you turn away, know that the duty of God is to convey to you.
Those who believe and do good deeds, there is no sin for those who believe and do good deeds, and fear Allah, and do good deeds, and do good deeds. God loves the righteous.
O ye who believe! Lo! Allah hath come to you the game, and your lances may be in your hands, so that He may know those who fear Him, and whosoever disbelieveth in the Oneness of Allah - a painful torment.
O you who have faith! Do not stand in the state of the orphan, and when you are burdened away, then let one of you, he will have made for you a like of what he has made for you, unless he may have a share of one another. For those who have been given a means of a year, it is an expiation for him. And whoever turns his own, it is for him a expiation, and whosoever repents. God is Mighty, Dominant.
Lawful to you is the game of the fish and the travelers for you, and for the travellers is a provision for you, and the game of the land. And fear Allah, and be careful of the land. And fear Allah to Whom you will be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, and the moon and the garlands, and the garlands and the garlands. That is that you know that God knows what is in the heavens and the earth. God is All-knowing of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger of the Messenger is only to convey the message to you, and Allah knows what you conceal.
Say: "The good and the good are not equal, even though the abundance of the bad may be given you. So fear Allah, so that you may prosper."
O you who have faith! Do not ask them concerning what they have been revealed to you, and if you have despaired of them, they will have come to you. If you come to them, they will have been revealed to you. God is All-forgiving and All-forbearing.
A people before you asked questions before them, and they disbelieved,
Allah has not forbidden the she'an, nor a camel, nor a camel, nor a camel, and the cattle; they fabricate lies against Allah; and most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has revealed to the Messenger," they say: "We found our fathers following our fathers." And if their fathers had nothing, it would be said to them, and they were not guided.
O you who have faith! If you meet your own deeds, he will not harm you, nor will you harm any harm, and He will inform you of all things. He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who believe! When you meet a man, then let a part of a two parties, he will have given you two two, and if you are given a journey, then you are more numerous than you. And if you are in the land, then then they are in the state of death. And if they bear a witness, then they will be gathered to you, and they will surely be punished.
And if they are guilty, then those who have been guilty of the leave of the two-doers shall be left by two of them, and they will swear to them: "Be our testimony in our testimony," they swear, "Our testimony is truer than our testimony, and we will not be wrongdoers."
That is they that they may be able to produce their testimony, and they will not be able to bring their oaths or fear their oaths. Be wary of God, and be cautious. God does not guide the transgressing people.
On the Day when Allah will gather them, and the angels will say, "What will you say?" They will say, "We have no knowledge. You know the unseen."
And when Jesus said to Mary, "Son of Mary, I gave you to the son of Mary, and remember I gave you the mount of the Throne, and I have given you a part of the Children of Israel, and in the manner of Israel, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, and the Gospel. And the unbelievers came to them, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And when I said to the disciples, "Believe in Me, I believe in Me," they said, "We believe, and bear witness to us."
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord able to send down upon us a table of heaven?" He said: "Fear Allah, if you are believers."
They said, "We wish that we may eat our hearts, and that our hearts may be reassured, and that we may know that which we have promised us, and that we may be witnesses.”
And Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O Lord, our Lord! Send us a table like us in the sky, to make us a sign of this world, and a sign from us, and a sign for us, and give us, and You are the best of providers."
Allah said, "I am sending to you, and I will send you to those who have gone away from you, and I will punish you with the punishment of the Day of Resurrection."
And when Allah said to the son: "O Jesus, son of Mary, the son of Mary, if Allah will forgive me." He said, "If Allah wills, I will have my faith." He said, "This is what you have given me." He said, "I will know what you have done. You know what you do."
I did not say to them except that I commanded them to worship them. God is my Lord and my Lord. I were the witness of them. I were one of them, but I took me to die. You were a Watcher over you. You are the Witness over all things."
If You punish them, they are Your slaves. If You forgive them, You are the Almighty, the Wise.
Allah will say, "This is the Day when the truthful will not speak with their truthfulness. They will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will abide forever. God is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. That is the supreme triumph."
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and He has power over all things.
All praise is to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and the darkness, and the darkness of the sight of those who disbelieve.
It is He who created you from clay, then has appointed a term for you, and a term comes to Him. Then you are in doubt concerning it.
He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you do.
And there is not a sign from the signs of their Lord when they turn away from them, but they turn away from it.
Indeed, the truth has come to them, but they have come to them with what they used to ridicule.
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them in the earth? We have not established you in the earth, and We sent down upon you abundant abundant rain, and We sent down upon them abundant rain, and caused them with rivers flow, and We destroyed them for their sins.
Had We had sent down to you a Book, they would have touched it with their hands. Those who disbelieve will say: "This is nothing but plain magic."
And they say, "Why has not a angel been sent down to him?" Had We sent down a angel, it would have been settled for them, and they will not have been reprieved.
And if We had sent him a angel, We would have made him a man, and We would have made him a man, and they would have been confused in doubt.
And indeed there were mocked before you before those before thee, and they mocked at what they mocked.
Say: Travel in the land and see how was the end of those who were warned.
Ask them: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To Allah. He has prescribed mercy for Himself. On the Day of Resurrection, He will gather you all together. Those who have lost themselves will not believe.
To Him belongs all that is in the night and the day. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing."
Say: "Shall I take for Allah the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and who feeds for Allah and His sustenance." Say: "I have been commanded to be the first of the first, and He will give me the first."
Say: 'If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous Day,
And on that Day, whosoever will be averted from him, and Allah has mercy, and that is the manifest achievement.
And if Allah afflicts you with affliction, there is none who can remove it; and if He intends you, He is Able to do all things.
He is the Supreme of His servants, and He is the Wise, the Wise.
And they say: "This is the best of Allah." Say: "I am the witness of Allah." Say, "I have revealed to you what is revealed to you, and you have been revealed to those who believe." Say, "I have no knowledge over you." Say, "I have no knowledge over Allah." Say, "I have no knowledge of Allah, and I am unconcerned of what you do."
Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognize it as they recognize their own ofspring. Those who have lost themselves will not believe.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies His signs? Lo! the wrong-doers will not prosper.
And on the day when We shall gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated others, "Where are those whom you used to worship?"
Then they will not say, "God is our Lord, the Lord of our Lord."
See how they lie to what they used to fabricate, and they used to invent against themselves.
And among them are some who listen to you, and We have placed veils upon their hearts, and they have ears in their ears, and they understand not in the ears of their ears, and they will not believe in it. And when they come to you, they will not believe in it; and those who disbelieve, they are the ancient.
And they turn away from it, and they turn away from themselves, and they have no power to ruin except themselves.
If you could see when the Fire will see the Fire, they will say, "Woe to us, would we not believe, and we will not reject our Lord, and we will be among the believers.”
Nay, but they were wont to hide what they had done, and they will be returned to their souls, and they were liars. Indeed they are liars.
They say: "There is nothing but the life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected."
If you could see when they are before before their Lord, He will say, "Is not the truth?" They will say, "Yes," they will say, "Yes," and He will say, “Taste your punishment for the punishment."
Those who disbelieve in the meeting of Allah will surely be lost. When the Hour comes to them, they will say, "Alas for us!" They will bear their burdens, and they will carry their burdens. Evil is what they did.
And the life of this world is nothing but a sport but a pastime; and those who are careful of the Hereafter is better for the pious. Will you not understand?
We know what they say to you. They will not be grieved. Those who deny the signs of God are the unbelievers.
And indeed We have already gone before thee before you; and they were patient and they were persecuted until they came to help Our help; and there is no altering in the Words of Allah. And there came to you the apostles, and there is not a clear news.
And if they turn away, then seek a tunnel to you, and if thou canst a tunnel or a ladder to the heaven, they will bring you a sign. And if Allah willed, He would have given them all guidance. And do not be of the ignorant.
Only those who listen to the truth, and they are the dead, and the dead will be brought back to Him.
They say: "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Allah is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
There is no animal on the earth, nor its bird, nor the bird of its wings. We have no knowledge in the Book. We have neglected the Book.
Those who deny Our signs and are deaf in the darkness of darkness. God leads astray whomever He wishes, and guides whomever He wills, and He guides to whomever He wills.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered? If Allah's punishment come upon you, or the Hour, or the Hour, you will call upon Allah, if you are truthful."
In fact, they will call upon Him, and if He wills to remove you, you will call upon Him, and you attribute to Him what you associate with Him.
And indeed We sent apostles before you, and We seized them with distress and distress, so that they might humble themselves.
But why did they not remember when Our punishment came to them, they would humble their hearts, and their hearts were hardened, and Satan decked to them fair deeds.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded, We opened the gates of their gates, and We opened the gates of what they were given them, and they seized them suddenly, and they were despondent.
So the people of Pharaoh were destroyed, and they were commanded to be the Lord of the Universe.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered, if Allah took your hearing and your sight, and seal your hearts in your hearts, and seal your seal to Allah, Who can restore you (in the Oneness of Allah), then He will bring you (O Muhammad SAW)? See, We are the clear people."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered that if the punishment of Allah should come upon you suddenly or openly, would be destroyed except the wrongdoing people?"
And We have sent the Messengers with the bearer of good news and warners. And whosoever believeth and reforms, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
And as for those who reject Our signs, they shall have a shameful punishment for them.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, and I know the Unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel, and I am commanded to follow what is revealed to me." Say: "Are the blind and the seeing?" Say: "Are those who are blind?"
And warn the people of their Lord, that they may fear the people of their Lord, that they may have any guardian nor intercessor.
And that they may glorify their Lord morning and evening, and seek His pleasure in the night. You are not accountable for you, nor will you ask them for their account. You will not drive you from the way of the wicked.
And thus We made some of them a test of others, because they said: "Are us the people whom Allah has favoured us?" And Allah does not know the grateful.
When those who believe in Our signs come to you, say, "Peace be upon you. Your Lord has mercy for you." And whoever does wrong, then he repents, and thereafter, and thereafter, He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Thus do We explain Our signs, so that it may be a clear path.
Say: "Call to those whom you worship besides Allah." Say: "I do not follow your desires, lest I follow me, and I will surely be guided."
Say: "I am only a clear proof from my Lord, and you deny what you have no power to hasten. There is not for me to change anything for me. He is the truth of the truth. He is the best of deciders."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you seek to hasten to hasten for me, I would surely have been settled between you." And Allah knows best the Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.). And Allah knows the Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers, etc.).
To Him belongs the keys of the heavens and the earth. He knows all that is in the earth and the earth. No leaf falls to Him. There is nothing but a grain in the heavens and the earth, nor is a grain in it, nor is there anything smaller than the earth.
And He it is Who hath appointed you during night, and He knows what you will. Then He raises you to task it, then to you is a term. Then unto Him is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
He is the irresistible above His servants, and He sends guardians over you. And when death approaches you, Our angels will give him away, and they are not unaware.
Then they will be returned to Allah, their Lord, the True Reality. Unquestionably! He is the swiftest of reckoners.
Say: "Who rescues you from the darknesses of the land and the sea, and call you humbly in humility, and call your call to Him." They will say, "If only we wished."
Say: "Allah saves you from you, and He saves you from distress."
Say: "He is Able to send forth upon you from above you from above you, or from below you from the skies, and made you some factions, and made you taste the violence of violence. See how We explain Our signs to you, so that they may understand.
And the people of your people is the truth. Say: "I am not responsible to you."
Every soul is a finality, and you will know.
And when thou seest those who meddle with Our signs, turn away from them, until they meddle to you with another topic, and if you forget you, then do not oppress the unjust of the unjust.
And for those who fear their duty for their own deeds, and that they may fear that which they fear.
And be not like those who sell the religion of this world and pastime, and the life of this world, and the life of this world, so that he may warn them, and it will be a share of the Day of Resurrection. They will not have any guardian besides Allah, nor will they have any guardian besides Him. And if Allah intends for him, they will have no guardian, and a painful punishment awaits them.
Say, “Shall we not take to anyone other than Allah, or will harm him, nor will he harm harm from us?" And we were to see you, who would have turned away from you, and to lead you to see the path of their Lord. And they will say to them, "Let us the way of Allah." Say, "God has commanded us, and we have been commanded to submit."
And (He) said to prayer and prayer, and fear Him. He is the All-Knower to you.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth, and the day when the Hour will be sounded, and it will be said: "Be it it." His is the truth, and the Trumpet will be blown. He is the Knower of the heavens and the earth, and He is the Wise, the Wise.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols with idols? I see you, and you see your people in error."
So We gave him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be among those who believe.
When he saw the night, he saw it rising, and said: "This is my Lord." And when it set, he said, "I do not love the ignorant."
Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said: "This is my Lord." And when it set, he said: "If my Lord does not guide me, I will surely have followed me."
When he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "O my people, I am innocent of what you associate.”
I have taken my face to Him who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the idolaters.
And his people argued to him, and he said: "Do you argue to dispute with me with Allah? He has guided me to me, and I do not fear anyone with you. My Lord comprehends all things in knowledge. Will you not understand?
And what aileth you with what you fear with Allah, and do not fear you, and fear you with God that He has not sent down any authority to you, if you know?
Those who believe and do not believe in the way of Allah, for them are security, and they are rightly guided.
And this is Our argument, We gave him to his people. We raise them with degrees. Indeed your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.
And We gave him Isaac, and Jacob, and We guided Noah, and We guided Noah before Noah, and Job, and Job, and Job, and Job, and Moses, and Moses. Thus We reward the good.
And We gave him and Jesus, and Elias, and Elias was one of the righteous.
And Isma'il, Elisha, Jonah, and Jonah, and each of them We gave the nations.
And of their fathers and their descendants, and their brethren, and We guided them, and We guided them to a right path.
That is the guidance of Allah, He guides whomever He wills of His servants, and if they had associated partners to Him, they would have been punished for what they used to earn.
They are the ones of whom We gave the Book and the wisdom, and the Prophethood, and the people who believe in it, We have entrusted it to a people who disbelieve.
Those are they whom Allah has guided, and follow their guidance. Say, "I ask no of you for this for you. This is the reminder of all things."
And do not say to what Allah has given to them, they say: "Why is not a treasure sent down to him." Say: "The Book has been sent down to you, and He has given you a Book, and He has made you what you were given." Say: "Allah has knowledge of what you have given, and you have no knowledge in their ears."
And it is a Book which We have sent down to those before whom We have been revealed before it, and that thou mayst warn the Mother of Cities, and warn those who believe in the Hereafter, and those who believe in the Hereafter, and they are pleased.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or has been revealed to me, and has been revealed to him, or is a angel. Say, "He has sent down to you the Book, and has sent down to you the Book." And if you were guilty, they will say, "You will have taken your hands." You will suffer the punishment of the Fire.
And indeed We have come to you (O Muhammad SAW) to Us (O Muhammad SAW), before you (O Muhammad SAW), before you (O Muhammad SAW), before whom We had been sent before you. And We did not see you with those who were partners (to you), and We did not see you with those who were partners (to you). And those who were partners to you will have failed that which ye used to worship.
And Allah is the cleaver of the grain and the grain, and He brings forth the living from the dead, and He brings forth the living from the dead. That is Allah. How where are you reverting?
It is He Who splits the night, and the day, and the night, and the sun and the moon. He is the All-mighty, the All-knowing.
And it is He who has made the stars that you may rest in it, and in the darkness of the land, and We have made for you a signs, and We have made the signs clear for the people who understand.
And it is He who produced you from a single soul, then made you a place of storage, and in the place of storage. We have detailed a signs for people who understand.
And it is He who sends down water from the sky, then We have made it grow to grow of every kind of vegetation, and We bring forth therewith fruits with it, and We produce it with clusters of clusters of dates, and of the fruit, and the olive, and the olive, and the pomegranates, and the pomegranates, and the pomegranates, and the fruits thereof. Surely in that are signs for those who believe.
And they have created the partners of Allah, and He created them, and He created them, and they impute to Him sons and daughters. Glory be to Him! High be He above what they describe.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and He has no share in the heavens and the earth. He has created everything. He has knowledge of all things.
That is Allah, your Lord, there is no god but He. He has created all things. So serve Him. He is the Guardian of all things.
No vision can grasp Him, and He perceives what He wills. He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Indeed your Lord has come to you from clear proofs, and whoever does evil, it is for his own soul, and whoever goes blind, it is to him, and I am not a guardian over you.
Thus We explain the signs to them, so that they may say, "You have studied," so that they may know it, and that We may know it.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god except Him. So turn away from those who are polytheists.
Had Allah had willed, they would not have taken up anything besides Him. And We have not made you a watcher over them, nor are you to see them.
Do not abuse those whom they worship besides Allah, lest they may be disrespectful up to Allah in knowledge. Thus, We have made every nation seem decorous to every nation, and they will have their return to their Lord, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
They swear by God by God that if a sign came to them, they believe in it. Say, "The signs of God is with Allah." And when they believe in it, they would not believe in it.
And their hearts, and their eyes, and their eyes, they will have believed in it, and We will wander blindly in their footsteps, blindly, wandering blindly.
And if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead, and the dead would have gathered them all together, and they would not have believed in it. Had Allah not willed, they would not believe in it.
Thus, We have made every human beings as a enemy, and among the devils, and the devils, each of them. Had your Lord had pleased, they would not have done it. Had your Lord had pleased, they would not have done it, and they will bear witness against them.
And those who do not believe in the Everlasting Life, seeking their hearts in the hearts of Allah, and they are pleased of what they have done.
Shall I should seek any other than Allah? He has sent down to you the Book and the Book. Those who have given the Book know that it has been revealed to you from your Lord. So do not be of the doubters.
And the word of your Lord is with truth and justice. There is no changing to Him. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
If you were in the majority of those who were in the earth, they will lead you from the Path of Allah. They follow nothing but conjecture.
Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
And what you believe in Allah's revelations, and that which you have been given in Allah's name,
And what aileth you that which Allah has not mentioned to you of the name of the heavens and the earth, that He hath forbidden you to eat it? And many of those who follow their lusts without knowledge. Lo! thy Lord is well Knower of the transgressors.
And abandon the outward and the inward, and those who are guilty will be recompensed for what they used to earn.
And do not eat that the name of Allah has not been pronounced, so that it is an sin for you, and the devils inspire you with their tongues; and if you obey them, then you are the idolaters.
Is he who was dead, then We gave him life, and made him a light of which he has given him? Is he like him who is secure in the darkness of the Fire? Thus the disbelievers have been decked to them, so that they have been decked.
And thus have We made every town in its town, so that they may commit corruption in the land, and they have no power of the earth. And they do not know.
And when a sign comes to them, they say: "We will not believe until we believe in the Messenger of Allah, until we will not believe in Allah." But Allah knows best what He has given His servants. And they will have a severe punishment.
Whomsoever Allah desires to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and He leads astray to whomever He wishes, and he leaves astray upon his heels, and he finds it in the sky. Those who do not believe in God’s way, God will have sealed a way.
This is a straight path for your Lord. We have made a signs clear for people who believe.
Their reward will be the reward of their Lord, and He is the best of what they used to do.
On the Day when He will gather them all together, He will say: "O jinn, jinns of jinn!" And many of men are men, and among those who were proud, "Our Lord, we have given us a share for us." They will say, "Our Lord, there is the Fire for us." He will say: "You will abide in the Fire. Your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing."
Thus do We make the evildoers to be like to be recompensed for what they used to earn.
O assembly of jinn and mankind! Did there not come to you apostles from among you, relating to you My verses, relating to you My signs, and warn you of the Day of Resurrection? They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves." They will surely bear witness against them, and they bear witness against themselves.
That is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly, except their inhabitants.
And all of them are degrees in what they have done, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
Your Lord is the Most Acceptor of need. If He willed, He could have made you successors, and He will make you successors, and He will raise you of a way, and He will raise you of the people of the seed of the children of Israel.
Indeed that which you have promised is surely come to you, and you will not be able to frustrate.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Work according according to your work. I am acting of my work. You will know to know you in the Hereafter. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not prosper."
And of the cattle, He has created some of the cattle and the cattle, and they say, "This is God's," and they say, "This is God's," and they ascribed partners to Him, and their associates is nothing; and what is with Allah is a thing.
Thus, the idolaters have made the children of the children of their Lord, and they have made their children seem decorous to them, and they have made their ruin, and they would have taken their religion. Had Allah had willed, they would not have done it. So leave them with what they fabricate.
And they say: "These animals are forbidden and crops and crops." And they have forbidden that which they have given them, and they are forbidden by cattle, and they have forbidden the name of Allah, and they have forbidden the name of Allah, and they will inform them.
And they say: "What is in the bellies of the cattle is reserved for our males, and our wives are forbidden for our wives. If they had been stillborn, they will share themselves. He will punish them for them. He is All-knowing and All-knowing.
Those who slayed their children, without knowledge, and knowledge, and do not know what God has provided for them. They are the losers, and they are not guided.
And He it is Who produceth gardens and untrellised, and the date-trees, and the date-trees, and the date-trees, and the pomegranates, and the pomegranates, and the pomegranates; and the fruit thereof, and the day of its fruit, and do not waste; and He does not love the prodigal.
And of the cattle are some, and some of the burdens of the cattle. Eat of what Allah has provided you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is your open enemy.
Eight of pairs, two of sheep, and two of goats. Ask them, "Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or the wombs of the two females? Inform me, if you are truthful."
And of the two camels, two of oxen pairs, and two of oxen. Say: "Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or the two females? Or, when you were witnesses to you?" What who invent a lie against Allah, when you were witnesses before you? And who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah, and who does wrong astray. God does not guide the wrongdoing people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I have no knowledge to eat that which has been revealed to me of what has been revealed to me, or to eat the flesh of swine, and blood, and blood. And the flesh of the swine, and the flesh of swine. And whoever does not steal in the name of Allah, He is your Lord, Most Merciful.
And to those who were Jews We made the animal to claws, and We made unlawful to them the fat and the sheep, and We made them the fat of the sheep, or the entrails, or the entrails, and that which was mixed to them; so We requited them with their rebellion; and We are the truthful.
But if they accuse you, say, "Your Lord is the Lord of your Lord, and none will not be averted from the sinners.”
And the idolaters will say: "Allah has begotten us. Had Allah willed, we would not have worshiped anything besides Him, nor would we have forbidden anything." Those who were before them said to them, "Did you come to us?" Say, "Produce us. You follow nothing but conjecture. You follow nothing but conjecture. You are only conjecture."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah's is the conclusive argument. Had He wished, He would have guided you to the right path."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Bring witness to your witnesses, and bear witness that which they testify to Allah, and do not bear witness with them, and do not bear witness with those who deny Our signs and do not believe in the Hereafter, nor do they believe in the Hereafter.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah has forbidden you to inherit what you have given to you. Do not give anyone with Him, and do not kill your children and children. Do not kill your children. Do not kill them. We will give you sustenance of the good. This is best for you, and what you do not know. This is best for you."
And do not approach the orphan's property with the orphan, until he reaches his maturity, and give the weight of justice, and give the weight of justice. We do not charge any soul except according to its capacity. And when you speak, then speak to each other, and fulfil Allah’s covenant, and fulfil what He has given you, then Allah has given you what you may.
And that it is my path, so follow me, and follow not those who follow you, and follow you from the path of Allah. That is He that you fear.
Then We gave Moses the Book to complete a benediction of good things, and a explanation of everything, and a guidance, and a mercy, that they may believe in their Lord.
This is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it, and be cautious.
(O Muhammad), do not say to those who were given the Book, "We have been sent down to the two groups, and we were unaware of our forefathers."
Or lest it is said to them, “Had it been been a Book been sent down to us, they would certainly have been guided in guidance than it. Indeed, there has come to you from your Lord, and guidance and mercy, and who is more unjust than he who denies the signs of Allah, and turns away from them from the signs of Allah. We will have a painful punishment.
Do they not wait that the angels should come to them or your Lord should come to them? The signs of the signs of your Lord will come to you, except the Day of Resurrection, except for the people who believed in it. Say, "If we not believe in it and do not believe in it, we will have no faith in it." Say, "Wait be waiting."
Those who have split their religion in the religion of their religion, and they have been sects. Their affair is to Allah, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
Whoever brings a good deed, it shall be a like thereof; and whoever commits a evil deed, it shall be requited for it, and they will not be wronged.
Say, "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, the creed of Abraham, the creed of Abraham, the creed of Abraham, and he was not one of the polytheists.”
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My prayer and my sacrifice, and my dying and my dying, and my Lord is the Lord of the worlds.
He has no partner to Him. I have been commanded to be of the first."
Say: "Shall I seek a lord other than Allah? He is the Lord of all things, and He knows all things. No soul bear the burden of another soul, and no bearer of burdens shall bear another another. Then your Lord will inform you of what you used to know.
And He it is Who has made you caliphs in the earth, and He raised on you some of what He has given you. Lo! your Lord is the Lord of what He has given you. Lo! He is Forgiving, Merciful.
<unk>.
(Muhammad), We have sent down the Book to you, so that you may be reminded of it, so that it may be in your heart, and a reminder for the believers.
Follow that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and follow no other than Him. Little do not take any admonition for you.
How many a town have We destroyed, and Our punishment came to them at night, while they were sleeping.
But when Our punishment came to them, they forgot nothing, but they were wont to worship.
Then We shall surely question those to whom We have sent to them, and We shall surely be sent with the messengers.
So We narrate to them with knowledge, and We were not absent.
And on that Day, the weighing shall be brought with, and those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, they are those who have lost their souls, because they used to reject Our signs.
And indeed We have established you in the earth, and made for you the livelihood of livelihood. Little little you give thanks.
And indeed We created you, then We created you, then We said to the angels, "Prostrate down to Adam," and they prostrated themselves, and he was not of those who prostrated.
He said: "What prevented you, when I commanded you?" He said, "I am better than me." He said, "I am better than me, and He created me from clay."
He said: "Get down from it, you will not be able to be arrogant in the land. Begone, then, you are of the righteous."
He said: Give me respite till the Day of Resurrection.
He said: "You are of the respited."
He said: "Because I have led me astray, I will surely have been guided to you."
Then I shall come before them and from them, and from their right, and from their right, and from their left, and you will not find mercy.
He said, "Begone, despised, and outcast. I will fill you with those who follow you. I will fill Hell with Hell."
And (Adam) said: "O Adam! Dwell your wife in Paradise, and eat of it, and eat not in this tree, but do not approach the tree."
But Satan whispered to them with what they had been told to them, and said to them: "Your Lord has forbidden you to eat this tree, lest you become angels or immortals."
And he said to them: verily I am of the righteous.
So he whispered to them, and when they tasted the tree, their shameful parts became manifest to them, and they began to cover them from the leaves of the garden. Their Lord said to them, "Did I not forbid you, and did not prohibit you from what you did not know?"
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, so forgive us not, and forgive us, and have mercy upon us, we shall be among the losers.”
He said, "Get down, you shall be enemies of one another. And you will have a earth in the life of the earth and a enjoyment for a while.
He said, “You will be given you, and you will die, and you will be brought forth from it.”
O Children of Adam! We have made you raiment to cover you to eat, and feathers, and the raiment of the tree. That is better for the people who believe.
O Children of Adam! Do not Satan seduce you to seduce you from your parents, stripping the Garden of Paradise, stripping them of their clothing, so that they may recognise them with their clothing, and he sees you with what they did not see you. We have made those who have faith.
And when they commit a shameful indecency, they say: We found our fathers doing, and Allah has enjoined us. Say: 'Allah does not command His soul, and you do not know what you do not know."
Say: "My Lord has commanded me. So when you call on Him, turn your prayer to Him, and call to Him to worship Him, and to Him sincerely obedient to Him, and to Him you will return."
And He has guided a guidance, and he has a party of them, and they have taken guardians over Allah, and they have taken guardians from Allah, and they are rightly guided.
O Children of Adam! Take your adornment in every adornment, and eat of its adornment, and eat not. Lo! He approveth not the wasters.
Say, "Who has forbidden the adornment of God, and has made His provision for His servants?" Say, "These are in the life of this world, in the life of this world, and in the Day of Judgment. We have made a signs to people who have faith."
Say, "My Lord has forbidden indecencies, and the inward, and the inward, and the inward, and the inward, and those who do not associate partners with God, and that which He has sent down no authority, and that which you do not know.”
And every nation is a nation appointed; when their term comes, they cannot not delay it, nor can they precede it.
O Children of Adam! When there come to you apostles from among you, relating to you My messages, and those who fear Allah, and fear those who fear Him, nor shall they grieve.
As for those who reject Our signs and are proud of pride, they are the inmates of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies His signs, and who is given a portion of their book, and the angels will say, “Where will come to us before the angels before us?" They will say, "Where whom you call upon besides God?" They will say, "We have forsaken us."
He will say: "Enter the Fire before those before you, and those before whom you were gathered before before, and there is a group of those who passed behind." They will say, "Our Lord!" And when it comes to them, they will say, "Our Lord, we have led us astray, and the punishment of the Fire will come to them." He will say: "You have no share of the Fire."
And the first among them will say to those who were given them: "You were not a tyrant, so taste what you used to earn."
Indeed, those who reject Our signs and those who deny Our signs, shall be opened with the gates of the heaven, nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. Thus do We requite the guilty.
They shall have a bed of Hell, and their faces shall be hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers.
And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall not have any soul except any soul. They are the inhabitants of Paradise, wherein they will abide forever.
And We shall remove their hearts in their hearts, and they will be brought into gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will say: "All praise belongs to Allah. Had Allah not guided us, we would have guided it. Had Allah not guided us, we would not have guided it. Our Lord's messengers came to us, "This is the Paradise."
And the dwellers of the Fire will call out to the dwellers of the Fire: "Our Lord! We have found our promise to our Lord." Did did you not have fulfilled what your Lord promised with you? They will say: "Yes!" Then they will call the crier, and they will be called to the curse of Allah.
And those who hinder the path of Allah, and seek it to seek it, and they believe not in the Hereafter.
And there shall be a veil between them, and on the Day of Gathering, men shall be men in the heights, and they will call out to their marks, "Peace be upon you." They will not have entered them, and they will be asked.
