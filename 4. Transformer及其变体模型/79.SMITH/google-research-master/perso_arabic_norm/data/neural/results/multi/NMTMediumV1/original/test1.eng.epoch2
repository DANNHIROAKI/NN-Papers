And the example of those who have been forbidden in the land and the two women, and those who were forbidden in their homes, and their entrails, and their sheep, and their entrails, and their entrails, and their eyes, and they were not unjust.
And if they turn away, say: "I believe in the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and He is not unjust-doers."
They will say, "Had you not come to us, and we have been forbidden to you?" They say, "Had we not follow you?" They say, "We have been forbidden to you." They say, "This is nothing but the truth." Say, "This is nothing but the truth."

(Muhammad), say, "I am commanded to follow you from your Lord, and do not follow you." Say, "I am not guided to you, and I am not guided."
And We sent Moses to the Children of Israel, and We gave the Children of Israel, and We gave the Children of Israel, and We gave the Children of Israel.
(O Muhammad), We have sent down to you the Book, and We have sent down to you a guidance.
And they say, "This is nothing who has been sent down to you, and to the people of the ancients."
Or do they say, "Our Lord has been sent down to you?" And when they had been sent down to you, We have sent down to you a sign, and We have sent down to you a painful punishment, and who will not have a painful punishment.
Or do they think that the Hour will come to them from the Day of Resurrection, and they say, "Our Lord, have not come to you from the Day of Israel?" They will say, "Our Lord, do you have come to us?" They will say, "Our Lord!"
And those who dispute in their Lord, and they have no knowledge, and they will not be able to be able to be able. And Allah will judge between them.
And whoever who does good deeds, he will not be accepted to his own soul, and he will not be accepted to him, nor will they be wronged.
Say: "I am commanded to follow the religion of my Lord, and He has guided me, and He has guided me."
Say: "I am commanded to be my Lord, and I am the first of you, and He is the Best of all things."
He has no power over me, and I am commanded of me, and I am the first ones.
Say, "O my people! There is no god but He, the Lord of the heavens and the earth." Say, "He is no god but He, and He will gather you to whom He wills, and you will be returned to you."
It is He who created the heavens and the earth, and He made you successors from the sea, and He will make you successors from your Lord, and He will make you successors from your Lord. He is All-forgiving, Most Merciful.

And We have sent down to you the Book and the Quran, but that you may warn the truth, and you is no doubt.
And do not follow the truth with your Lord, and do not follow the truth.
And many a town We have destroyed before them, and We have destroyed them from a single blast.
And when they saw Our revelations, they will say, "Our Lord, never have been unjust to them?"
And We did not send them to hasten to them, and We have sent down to you a witness.
And We did not send them to hear, and We have been sent down to you.
And the Day when the Hour will be blown, and they will be in the weighing of the Hereafter.
And those who do not believe in the Hereafter, they will have no share in the earth, and they will not be wronged.
And We have created you in the land and the earth, and that you may be grateful.
And We did not send you to you, and We created you, and We created you, and We created you, and We created you, and We created you.
He said, "O my people! I have created you from my Lord, and I have created you from clay, and I have created you from clay, and I created you from clay."
They said: "O Lord, do not enter you from the land, and you will be able of you, and you will be among you."
He said, "My Lord! Respite me till the Day of Resurrection."
He said, "Indeed, I am a liar."
He said, "I have no knowledge to guide me. Indeed, I am a liar."
So they will see them from their ears, and they will not hear in their ears, and they will not be able to hear.
He said, "Descend of your Lord, and you will enter you from the Fire, and you will be among the Fire."
And We said: O Adam! Dwell your wife in your bellies, and do not drink in your bellies, and you will be a enemy for you.
And they turned away to them, and said: "O my people! Do you come to you from your Lord? Indeed, you is a enemy of your Lord, and you will not be able of you."
And they said: O my father! verily I am commanded of you.
So they will see them from the land, and they turned to them, and said, "Did you see the tree of Israel?" They said, "Did you not see?" They said: "Did you not see?"
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged over our Lord, and we will have followed our sins. You shall certainly be among the losers."
He said: "Descend of your Lord, you will be a enemy for you, and you will drink you, and you will be a enemy.
He will say: "It is the Day of Resurrection, and you will be raised to you, and you will be raised back to you."
O Children of Israel! We have made you a camel of your mother, and made you successors from the land, and made you successors from the land and the adornment of your Lord, and that you may be grateful.
O Children of Israel! When you have come to you a enemy from your mother, and the people of your mother, and the people of your mother, and the people of your mother, and the people of the people of your mother, and you will not be able to kill you. So you not see the people of the people of the people of the people of the people of the people of the people of Pharaoh.
And when they turn away, they say, "This is nothing but a witness." Say, "Allah is sufficient to you." Say, "Allah is sufficient to you." Say, "This is nothing but Allah."
Say: "I am commanded to worship God and His Messenger, and He has created you, and He has created you." Say, "I am commanded to worship Him."
Those who have surrendered in the way of Allah, and follow the truth, and follow the way of Allah. And Allah does not guide the unjust.
O Children of Israel! eat of the land and the adornment of the adornment of your adornment, and do not eat in the land, and do not eat.
Say: "O mankind of the heavens and the earth, and the adornment of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "It is no god but He's life, and those who do not believe in the life of the Hereafter."
Say: "O my people who believe in Allah and the Last Day." Say, "He is the One of the heavens and the earth." Say, "God is sufficient to you." Say, "Allah is not unjust to you."
And the Day when they will be able to hear, and they will not be able to hear.
O Children, "O Children of Israel! We have sent you to you a sign from your Lord, and you will not be accepted to you, nor shall you be accepted to you, nor shall be the losers.
As for those who disbelieve and do good deeds, they shall have the dwellers of Hell, and they shall abide therein forever.
Who is more unjust than those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the angels will say, "Our Lord, have not come to you?" They will say, "Our Lord!" They will say, "This is nothing for us." They will say, "This is nothing but the Fire." They will say: "This is nothing but a witness."
They will say, "O Lord, taste the punishment of the Fire, and the day of Resurrection, and the day of Resurrection, and the Day of Resurrection, and the day of Resurrection, and the Fire will come to us, and the punishment of the Fire will come to you, and you will not be able to die." They will say, "This is the punishment of your Lord." They will say: "This is nothing but the Fire."
And the dwellers of the city will say, "This is nothing but a punishment." They will say, "This is nothing but a punishment."
As for those who deny Our revelations, they will not be able to enter the gates of their Lord, and they will not enter the gates of the Fire, and they will not be able to enter them.
There is a troop for them, and We have prepared them into the Fire, and they will have a painful punishment.
As for those who believe and do good works, We shall have no reward for him; and whoever shall be a believer for the life of the life of the world, and they shall abide forever.
And they will make the earth, and they will say, "Our Lord, we have been given to us, and we will not be able to enter us." They will say: "Our Lord!" They will say, "Our Lord, we have been given to us." They will say: "This is nothing but the truth."
