# Fair submodular maximization

This is an efficient C++ implementation of the algorithms and baselines from
"Fairness in Streaming Submodular Maximization: Algorithms and Hardness".

The code should be provided with an oracle that returns the value of a subset of
elements. There are basic oracles provided. One can use these as examples.
The detailed explanations are provided in the source code.

## This is a command to compile the code

One needs to compile all the files using C++14 or later, or use the build file
provided.

## The command to run the algorithm.

Running is a simple command (./a), no need to give any flags.
