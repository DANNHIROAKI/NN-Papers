Flip-flops are a type of sandal, typically worn as a form of casual wear.	人字拖是一种凉鞋，通常是一种休闲服饰。
They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap known as a toe thong that passes between the first and second toes and around both sides of the foot or can be a hard base with a strap across all the toes (these can also be called sliders).	由一个扁平的鞋底组成，一条Y形的带子松散地固定在脚上，称为脚趾丁字带，穿过第一和第二脚趾之间以及脚两侧，或者可以是一个硬底座，在所有脚趾上都有一条带子（这些也可以称为滑块）。
This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures throughout the world, originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 1,500 B.C.	这种鞋类风格一直由世界各地许多文化的人们穿着，最早起源于公元前1500年的古埃及人。
In the United States the flip-flop descends from the Japanese zōri, which became popular after World War II as soldiers brought them back from Japan.	在美国，人字拖起源于日本zōri，二战后，当士兵从日本带回来时，日本zōri变得很受欢迎。

The term flip-flop has been used in American and British English since the 1960s to describe the thong or no-heel-strap sandal.	自20世纪60年代以来，人字拖一词在美国和英国英语中一直用于描述丁字鞋或无跟带凉鞋。
It is an onomatopoeia of the sound made by the sandals when walking in them.	这是穿着凉鞋行走时发出的声音的拟声。
They are called thongs (sometimes pluggers) in Australia, jandals (originally a trademarked name derived from "Japanese sandals") in New Zealand, slops or “visplakkies” in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and tsinelas or step-in in the Philippines (or, in some Visayan localities, "smagol", from the word smuggled).	在澳大利亚，它们被称为丁字鞋（有时是 plugger），在纽西兰被称为jandal（最初是源自「日本凉鞋」的商标名称），在南非和辛巴威被称为 slope 或「visplakkies」，在菲律宾被称为「tsinelas」或「step-in」（或者，在米沙鄢群岛部分地区，从单字 smuggled 变化为「smagol」）。
This footwear has a number of other names around the world.	这种鞋子在世界各地还有许多其他名字。
The Japanese wear similarly designed, traditional straw sandals known as zōri.	日本人穿着设计相似的传统草鞋，被称为zōri。
Throughout the world, they are known by a variety of other names, including dép tông or dép xỏ ngón in Vietnam, chinelos in Brazil, japonki in Poland, dacas in Somalia, sayonares (σαγιονάρες) in Greece, slippers in Hawaii, Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands, infradito in Italy, djapanki (джапанки) in Bulgaria,"charlie wote" in Ghana, "japanke" in Croatia and vietnamki in Russia and Ukraine, yezenes in Latvia.	在世界各地，它们以各种其他名称而闻名，包括越南的dép tông或dép xo ngón、巴西的 chinelos、波兰的 japonki、索马利亚的 dacas、希腊的 Saonares（σαγιονάρες）、夏威夷、巴哈马、千里达及托巴哥和荷兰的 slippers、义大利的 infradito、保加利亚的 djapanki（джапанки）、迦纳的「charlie wote」、克罗埃西亚的「japanke」、俄罗斯和乌克兰的 viernamki、拉脱维亚的 yezenes。

These differ from the sandals worn by the Mesopotamians, with the strap between the third and fourth toes.	美索不达米亚的人字拖又不同于前者，置于中指于无名指间。
In India, a related chappal ("toe knob") sandal was common, with no straps but a small knob sitting between the first and second toes.	印度的 chappal 鞋（指扣鞋）也很普及，没有趾带，但有个钮扣置于第一与第二指间。
They are known as Padukas.	这类鞋子称为 Padukas。
The modern flip-flop became popular in the United States as soldiers returning from World War II brought Japanese zōri with them.	在美国当代人字拖的流行，源自二次世界大战返国的士兵，自日本带回的 zori。
It caught on in the 1950s during the postwar boom and after the end of hostilities of the Korean War.	正好遇上 1950 年代战后婴儿潮与韩战的结束。
As they became adopted into American popular culture, the sandals were redesigned and changed into the bright colors that dominated 1950s design.	在人字拖为美国流行文化接纳之时，鞋款重新设计并导入亮眼色彩，是 1950 年代的主流设计风格。
They quickly became popular due to their convenience and comfort, and were popular in beach-themed stores and as summer shoes.	这类鞋种快速普及，因为方便又舒服，在海滩主题商店很常见，当作夏天的凉鞋。
During the 1960s, flip-flops became firmly associated with the beach lifestyle of California.	1960年代，人字拖与加州的海滩生活方式密不可分。
As such, they were promoted as primarily a casual accessory, typically worn with shorts, bathing suits, or summer dresses.	因此，这类鞋在宣传时主打当作休闲配件，常与短裤、泳装和夏季服饰搭配。
As they became more popular, some people started wearing them for dressier or more formal occasions.	因为愈来愈普及，也有人开始在时尚或较正式的场合穿人字拖。
In 1962, Alpargatas marketed a version of flip-flops known as Havaianas in Brazil.	1962 年，Alpargatas 公司在巴西推出一种称为哈瓦仕的人字拖。

Flip-flops quickly became popular as casual footwear of young adults.	人字拖在年轻人之间很快成为热门休闲鞋类。
Girls would often decorate their flip-flops with metallic finishes, charms, chains, beads, rhinestones, or other jewelry.	女生经常会用金属饰品、铃铛、链子、珠子、莱茵石、其他珠宝等来装饰人字拖。
High-end flip-flops made of leather or sophisticated synthetic materials are commonly worn in place of sneakers or loafers as the standard, everyday article of casual footwear, particularly among teenagers and young adults, although it is not unusual to see older people wearing playful, thick-soled flip-flops in brilliant colors.	高级皮制或高级合成材料制成的人字拖，经常在运动或休闲场所当做标准的每日休闲鞋类，特别是在青少年与年轻人间；不过年纪较长的人不太穿这种色彩抢眼的休闲厚底人字拖。
Platform and high-heel variants began to appear in the 1990s.	1990 年代开始出现厚底和高跟版本。
A minor controversy erupted in 2005 when some members of Northwestern University's national champion women's lacrosse team visited the White House wearing flip-flops.	2005 年，因为部分获得全国冠军的西北大学女子曲棍球员，在造访白宫时穿着人字拖，因此引发了小股争议。
The team responded to critics by auctioning off their flip-flops on eBay, raising $1,653 USD for young cancer patient, Jaclyn Murphy of Hopewell Junction, New York, who was befriended by the team.	该队回应批评的方式，是将其人字拖在 eBay 上拍卖，为该队队员的朋友，住在纽约的年轻癌症病患 Jaclyn Murphy 募得 1,653 美元。
There is still a debate over whether this signaled a fundamental change in American culture — many youth feel that flip-flops are dressier and can be worn in a variety of social contexts, while older generations feel that wearing them at formal occasions signifies laziness and comfort over style.	这事件是否代表美国文化从根改变，仍有争议；许多年轻人觉得人字拖是种时尚，可在不同社交场合中穿着，而老一辈的人则觉得在正式场合穿着人字拖，突显这些贪图方便舒适，不在乎雅观。
In 2011, while vacationing in his native Hawaii, Barack Obama became the first President of the United States to be photographed wearing a pair of flip-flops.	2011 年，巴拉克・欧巴马在家乡夏威夷度假时，成为第一个被拍到穿着人字拖的美国总统。
The Dalai Lama of Tibet is also a frequent wearer of flip-flops and has met with several U.S. presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, while wearing the sandals.	西藏的达赖喇嘛也经常穿着人字拖，曾经如此会见数名美国总统，包括小布希和欧巴马。
While exact sales figures for flip-flops are difficult to obtain due to the large number of stores and manufacturers involved, the Atlanta-based company Flip Flop Shops claimed that the shoes were responsible for a $20 billion industry in 2009.	虽然因为有太多商店和制造厂，使得人字拖的精确销量数字难以取得，但在亚特兰大的 Flip Flop Shops 说 2009 年的人字拖产值高达 200 亿美元。
Furthermore, sales of flip-flops exceeded those of sneakers for the first time in 2006.	更有什者，2006 年的人字拖销量超过各类运动鞋。
If these figures are accurate, it is remarkable considering the low cost of most flip-flops.	如果这些数字精确无误，那就非常可观，因为大多数人字拖都很便宜。
The modern flip-flop has a very simple design, consisting of a thin rubber sole with two straps running in a Y shape from the sides of the foot to the gap between the big toe and the one beside it.	当代人字拖的设计很简单，由一个薄橡胶鞋底，配上呈 Y 字型的两条束带，从脚板两侧到大姆指与食指中间的缝。
They typically do not have a strap around the heel, although heeled varieties are available, as well as flip-flops designed for sports, which come with added support common to athletic shoes, with the thong between the toes.	脚跟处通常没有束带，不过有些变化鞋种有鞋跟，也有专为运动设计的人字拖，在脚趾到脚板间加上常见于运动鞋的加强支撑。
Most modern flip-flops are inexpensive, costing as little as $5 USD, or less in some parts of the world.	大多数的当代人字拖不贵，价格多在 5 美元以下，在世界其他地方还更便宜。
They are made from a wide variety of materials, as were the ancient thong sandals.	制作材质非常多元，就和古代的人字拖一样。
The modern sandals are made of more modern materials, such as rubber, foam, plastic, leather, suede, and even fabric.	当代的人字拖使用现代的材质，例如橡胶、发泡材质、塑胶、皮革、仿皮，也有用纤维制的。
Thongs made of polyurethane have caused some environmental concerns; because polyurethane is a number 7 resin, they can't be easily discarded, and they persist in landfills for a very long time.	使用聚胺酯制作的鞋面，往往造成环境问题；因为聚胺酯属于第7类合成品，不可随意丢弃，且在掩埋场中会持续很长时间无法分解。
In response to these concerns, some companies have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber, such as that from used bicycle tires, or even hemp, and some offer a recycling program for used flip flops.	为了对应这类问题，部分公司开始贩售以回收橡胶制成的人字拖，例如使用脚踏车废胎，甚至使用大麻纤维，也有公司推出回收计画，回收废人字拖。
Because of the strap between the toes, flip-flops are typically not worn with socks.	因为在脚趾间会有束带，所以穿人字拖时通常不穿袜子。
In colder weather, however, some people wear flip-flops with toe socks.	不过天冷时，会有人穿着脚趾袜来穿人字拖。
The Japanese commonly wear tabi, a type of sock with a single slot for the thong, with their zōri.	在日本很普遍的足袋，就是一种可以搭配 zori 穿的单趾袜。
While flip-flops do provide the wearer with some mild protection from hazards on the ground, such as hot sand at the beach, glass, thumb tacks or even fungi and wart-causing viruses in locker rooms or community pools, their simple design is responsible for a host of other injuries of the foot and lower leg.	人字拖虽能提供穿戴者适当的防护，避免他们因踩到海滩上的烫脚沙粒、碎玻璃、图钉等物品而造成危害，甚或在更衣室或社区泳池感染霉菌和病毒疣，但是其简朴的设计也会导致足部和小腿等处受到其他伤害。
Walking for long periods in flip-flops can be very tough on the feet, resulting in pain in the ankles, legs, and feet.	穿着人字拖长时间行走可能会让双脚十分不适，导致脚踝、腿部和足部疼痛。
A 2009 study at Auburn University found that flip-flop wearers took shorter steps and their heels hit the ground with less vertical force than those wearing athletic shoes.	据奥本大学于 2009 年进行的研究指出，穿着人字拖的人相较于穿着运动鞋的人，前者的行走步距较短且脚跟踩地的垂直作用力也比较弱。
Individuals with flat feet or other foot issues are advised to wear a shoe with better support.	建议有扁平足或其他足部问题的人穿上鞋子，获得更完善的支撑。
The lack of support provided by thong sandals is thought by some to be a major cause of injuries.	有些人认为缺少支撑的夹脚拖为造成伤害的主要原因之一。
Some flip-flops have a spongy sole, causing the foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground (over-pronation).	有些人字拖的鞋底为海棉材质，导致足部在踩到地面时会过度往内旋转 (过度内旋)。
Flip-flops can cause a person to overuse the tendons in their feet, resulting in tendonitis.	人字拖会让人过度使用足部肌腱，进而导致肌腱发炎。
Ankle sprains or broken bones are also common injuries, due to stepping off a curb or tumbling; the ankle bends, but the flip-flop neither holds on to nor supports it.	因为在路缘踩空或绊倒而造成的脚踝扭伤或骨折均为常见伤害。人字拖无法在脚踝扭转时妥善保护或给予支撑。
The straps of the flip-flop may cause frictional issues, such as rubbing, during walking.	人字拖的绑带会导致摩擦力问题，例如在行走时磨到脚。
The open-toed nature of the thongs may result in cuts, scrapes, bruises, or stubbed toes.	人字拖会让脚趾露出来，可能因此造成割伤、刮伤、挫伤或踢伤等问题。
Despite all of these issues, flip-flops do not have to be avoided completely.	尽管会有这些问题出现，但我们也不必完全避开人字拖。
Many podiatrists recommend avoiding the inexpensive, drug store varieties and spending more on sandals with thick-cushioned soles, as well as ones that have a strap that's not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle.	有许多足科医师建议避免购买廉价的药妆店款式，而是多花些钱去购买厚底且有软垫的凉鞋，并附有非帆布材质且位置十分接近脚踝的绑带。
A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a device used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped shape (though some are covered in plastic).	回纹针是用来将纸张夹在一起的文具用品，通常是将金属线弯折成回圈状来制作而成 (不过有些会包上一层塑胶膜)。
Most paper clips are variations of the Gem type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire.	大多数的回纹针都是从在 1890 年代之前问世的宝石 (Gem) 牌回纹针演变而来，其特色为将金属线弯折成近乎完整的两个回圈。
Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper.	通常回纹针所运用的是金属本身的扭转力和弹力，以及金属和纸张之间的摩擦力。
When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two "tongues" of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together.	当回纹针的双「舌」之间塞入了相当数量的纸张后，会迫使这两片针舌分开并导致金属在弯折过后产生扭转力，进而将这些纸张牢牢夹在一起。
Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes.	回纹针通常会是两侧笔直的长椭圆形，不过也会出现三角形或圆形，或是更加精心设计的形状。
The most common material is steel or some other metal, but moulded plastic is also used.	最常使用的材质为钢铁或其他金属，不过也有使用塑胶压制而成。
Some other kinds of paper clip use a two-piece clamping system.	有些其他种类的回纹针会使用双片钳夹设计。
Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips.	近日来的创新发展包括了七彩缤纷的塑胶包膜回纹针以及弹簧固定式活页夹。
According to the Early Office Museum, the first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay in 1867.	根据昔日办公博物馆 (Early Office Museum) 的资料显示，金属弯折回纹针的第一份专利是由美国于 1867 年授予 Samuel B. Fay。
This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together.	尽管这份专利认可它能用来把纸夹在一起，但其实这枚回纹针原本主要是用来把票券夹在衣服上。
Fay received U.S. patent 64,088 on April 23, 1867.	Fay 于 1867 年 4 月 23 日获得美国第 64088 号专利。
Although functional and practical, Fay's design along with the 50 other designs patented prior to 1899 are not considered reminiscent of the modern paperclip design known today.	Fay 的设计以及在 1899 年之前的另外 50 项专利设计尽管都十分实用且务实，但其实都不太会让人联想到今日广为人知的现代版回纹针设计。
Another notable paper clip design was also patented in the United States by Erlman J. Wright in 1877.	另一款引人注目的回纹针设计，则是由 Erlman J. Wright 在 1877 年获得美国专利认可。
This clip was advertised at that time for use in fastening newspapers.	这款回纹针在当时是以其能够扣紧报纸来打广告。
The most common type of wire paper clip still in use, the Gem paper clip, was never patented, but it was most likely in production in Britain in the early 1870s by "The Gem Manufacturing Company", according to the American expert on technological innovations, Professor Henry J. Petroski.	目前最常见且一直还有人使用的金属线圈回纹针 (即宝石牌回纹针) 反而从未获得专利。据美国的科技创新专家 Henry J. Petroski 教授表示，这款回纹针很有可能是在 1870 年代早期，由英国的「宝石公司」负责制造生产。
He refers to an 1883 article about "Gem Paper-Fasteners", praising them for being "better than ordinary pins" for "binding together papers on the same subject, a bundle of letters, or pages of a manuscript".	他引述了一篇 1883 年关于「宝石牌纸夹」的文章，文内盛赞这款纸夹「比一般的别针更好用」，能够「将内容主题相同的纸张、一堆信件或是好几页手稿夹在一起」。
Since the 1883 article had no illustration of this early "Gem", it may have been different from modern paper clips of that name.	因为这篇 1883 年的文章并未附上这款早年的「宝石牌」的示意图，所以可能会跟现代所谓的回纹针有所差异。
The earliest illustration of its current form is in an 1893 advertisement for the "Gem Paper Clip".	最早绘制出其目前样式的示意图，出现在 1893 年的「宝石牌回纹针」广告文宣中。
In 1904 Cushman & Denison registered a trademark for the "Gem" name in connection with paper clips.	1904 年，Cushman & Denison 注册了与回纹针有关的「宝石牌」商标。
The announcement stated that it had been used since March 1, 1892, which may have been the time of its introduction in the United States.	这份公告表明了这项商标在 1892 年 3 月 1 日之前都还没有人用过，也可能就是在这个时候来引进到美国境内。
Paper clips are still sometimes called "Gem clips", and in Swedish the word for any paper clip is "gem".	回纹针现在有时候还是会被称作是「宝石夹」。在瑞典文中，回纹针的通称即为「宝石」。
Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest, is the patent granted to William Middlebrook of Waterbury, Connecticut on April 27 of that year for a "Machine for making wire paper clips." The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type.	目前能确切证明现代款式的回纹针最晚在 1899 年就广为人知的证据，为那一年 4 月 27 日于康乃狄克州的瓦特柏利授予 William Middlebrook 的「金属线圈回纹针制造机」专利。图中能清楚看见这台机器制造出宝石牌款式的精美回纹针。
The fact that Middlebrook did not mention it by name, suggests that it was already well known at the time.	Middlebrook 当时并未提及品牌名称，由此可见这款回纹针在那个时候已经广为人知。
Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented.	自此之后，由相同主题款式演变出来的各种设计都陆续获得专利认可。
Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip.	有些采用尖头设计取代圆头设计，有些会稍微弯折一下其中一个回圈的尾端，使其更容易夹入纸张，有些则会将金属线弯折成波浪形或倒钩状，让它能夹得更紧。
In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular, star, or round shapes.	除此之外，纯粹追求美感呈现的不同设计也获得了专利，比如三角形、星形或圆形的回纹针。
But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular.	不过，原始的宝石牌款式则风行了超过百年之久，在在证明它是最实用且持续稳坐人气宝座的王者。
Its qualities—ease of use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling—have been difficult to improve upon.	它的品质 (方便使用、紧扣而不怕撕裂，且储存时不会相互勾缠) 已经好到难以再多做改良了。
National Paperclip Day is May 29.	5 月 29 日是全国回纹针日。
It has been claimed, though apparently without evidence, that Herbert Spencer, the originator of the term "survival of the fittest", invented the paper clip.	尽管没有确切证据足以证明，但据说当年是曾写下「适者生存」的 Herbert Spencer 发明了回纹针。
Spencer claimed in his autobiography to have invented a "binding-pin" that was distributed by Ackermann & Company, and he shows a drawing of the pin in his Appendix I (following Appendix H).	Spencer 在他的自传中宣称自己发明了一款由阿克曼公司 (Ackermann & Company) 负责分销的「装订别针」，而且他还在附录 I (在附录 H 的后面) 中附上了图稿。
This pin looked more like a modern cotter pin than a modern paper clip, but it was designed to hold sheets of paper together.	这款别针看起来比较像是现代的发夹而非回纹针，不过它原先的设计就是用来将纸张夹在一起。
It is approximately 15 cm unfolded.	展开来约莫有 15 公分长。
A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866–1910), has erroneously been identified as the inventor of the paper clip.	挪威的 Johan Vaaler (1866–1910) 向来被误认为是回纹针的发明者。
He was granted patents in Germany and in the United States (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire.	他在德国和美国 (1901 年) 都曾以类似设计的回纹针获得专利认可，不过相较之下不太实用，金属线的部分也少了最后的扭转收尾。
Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway.	Vaaler 大概并不知道市面上已经有更优质的产品，尽管当时也尚未引进到挪威。
His version was never manufactured and never marketed, because the superior Gem was already available.	他的版本从未生产制造也从未在市面上贩售，因为当时已经有稳占上风的宝石牌了。
Long after Vaaler's death his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognised Norwegian genius.	在 Vaaler 过世了好一阵子之后，他的同乡创造出一个流传全国的民间传说，误称回纹针是由一位籍籍无名的挪威天才所发明。
Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip, and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips.	自 1950 年代以降的挪威辞典都说 Vaaler 是回纹针的发明人，而且这则民间传说之后还被纳入国际辞典和诸多有关回纹针的国际文献。
Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of more useful paper clips, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions.	尽管当时早就存在更实用的回纹针，但 Vaaler 大概还是顺利以自己的设计获得了海外专利，因为那时候的专利认证机构相当自由开放，且会奖励各种针对现有发明稍作修改的成果。
Johan Vaaler began working for Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor in Kristiania in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death.	Johan Vaaler 于 1892 年开始受雇于奥斯陆的 Alfred J. Bryns 专利工程师，并在之后晋升为经理，一路做到他逝世为止。
As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway.	身为专利办公室的职员，他可以轻易在挪威获得专利认可。
His reasons for applying abroad are not known; it is possible that he wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally.	至于他为何要申请海外专利，不得而知。有可能是他想要维护在国际上进行商业贸易的权利。
Also, he may have been aware that a Norwegian manufacturer would find it difficult to introduce a new invention abroad, starting from the small home market.	此外，他可能有注意到从小家庭市场起家的挪威制造商会难以将新发明推广到海外市场。
Vaaler's patents expired quietly, while the "Gem" was used worldwide, including his own country.	Vaaler 的专利在悄无声息间过了期，「宝石牌」则风行世界各地，包含了他自己的家乡。
The failure of his design was its impracticality.	他的设计错误在于其并不实用。
Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip.	由于少了研发完善的回纹针所拥有的两个完整回圈，纸张难以夹进他的回纹针。
One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle.	虽然我们可以调整一下内侧的金属线，让纸比较好夹进去，但外侧的金属线却让人束手无策，因为这款回纹针无法利用到扭转原理。
The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper.	这款回纹针反而会像是脊椎般将纸张垂直撑起来。
The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.	只要切掉宝石牌回纹针的外圈和一段长边，就能轻易展示 Vaaler 的设计有多不实用。
The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country.	挪威发明回纹针的民间传说起源自一位挪威的国家专利代理人。他为了在德国登记注册挪威的海外专利，在 1920 年代造访了德国。
He came across Vaaler's patent, but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip.	他翻阅到 Vaaler 的专利认证，却未能察觉这和当时常见的宝石牌回纹针并不相同。
In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip.	在所任职的专利代理机构的五十周年报告书中，他宣称 Vaaler 发明了日常所见的回纹针。
This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.	这一段话在第二次世界大战之后被收录到某些挪威的百科全书当中。
Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip.	那场世界大战让关于回纹针的神秘传说更加甚嚣尘上。
Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway were forbidden.	由于镶有旗帜的别针和暗指被迫流亡的挪威哈康七世的别针都陆续遭禁，爱国人士纷纷将回纹针别在制服衣领上，当作抵御侵占国土的德军和纳粹政权的象征。
Those wearing them did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time.	当时那些配戴回纹针的爱国人士并未将其视为国族象征，因为关于其起源自挪威的传说尚未广泛流传。
The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity ("we are bound together").	回纹针在当时代表着团结一心 (「我们彼此牢牢扣在一起」)。
The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them could risk severe punishment.	配戴回纹针的行为很快就遭到禁止，并祭出严厉处分。
The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952, but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention.	首屈一指的挪威百科全书在 1952 年的增补本中提到了回纹针是抵御外侮的象征，但是并未宣称其为挪威发明的产物。
That information was added in later editions.	挪威发明等言词则是在之后的版本才加了进去。
According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in France.	根据 1974 年版的内文，使用回纹针来表示抵御决心的做法起源自法国。
A clip worn on a lapel or front pocket could be seen as "deux gaules" (two posts or poles) and be interpreted as a reference to the leader of the French Resistance, General Charles de Gaulle.	配戴在衣领或前胸口袋的回纹针看起来犹如「双柱」或「双杆」 (法语为「deux gaules」，音似「戴高乐」)，可视为意指法国抵抗运动的领导人，查尔斯戴高乐将军。
The post-war years saw a widespread consolidation of the paper clip as a national symbol.	在大战结束后的数年间，将回纹针当做国族象征的想法广为流传且深植民心。
Authors of books and articles on the history of Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial.	许多撰写挪威科技史相关书籍和文章的作者抓紧机会大书特书，让原本内容单薄的故事更加充实且丰富。
They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the fully developed Gem-type clip.	他们选择忽视 Vaaler 的回纹针与研发完善的宝石牌回纹针并不相同的事实。
In 1989 a giant paper clip, almost 7 m (23 ft) high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler.	1989 年，一座将近 7 公尺 (23 英尺) 高的巨大回纹针耸立在邻近奥斯陆的一间商学院校园中，为了纪念 Vaaler 的发明荣获专利认可满九十周年。不过这座纪念碑的造型却是宝石牌回纹针，而非 Vaaler 当年取得专利的样式。
The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the paper clip culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent.	1999 年，在 Vaaler 完成提交德国专利申请的百年之后，关于挪威发明回纹针的传闻的庆祝声势达到最高峰。
A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness.	那一年发行了一款纪念邮票，就此展开一系列宣扬挪威发明实力的活动。
The background shows a facsimile of the German "Patentschrift".	邮票背景为那份德国「专利说明书」的复本。
However, the figure in the foreground is not the paper clip depicted on that document, but the much better known "Gem".	然而前面的图案却不是在那份专利说明书中描绘的回纹针，而是更广为人知的「宝石牌」。
In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (Norsk biografisk leksikon) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the paper clip.	2005 年，挪威的国家人物传记百科全书出版了 Johan Vaaler 的个人传记，称其为回纹针的发明人。
Wire is versatile in its nature.	金属线本身就具有多元用途。
Thus a paper clip is a useful accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force.	因此，回纹针在诸多机械作业中都是相当实用的配件，包括电脑作业：金属线只要稍加施力就能展开。
Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need.	有许多仪器装置需要极为细小的长杆来压下陷进去外壳里的按钮。使用者平常鲜少需要接触到这颗按钮。
This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an "emergency eject" should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh).	这颗按钮，在大多数的光碟机上是会在电源失常时用到的「紧急退出」钮。这也会出现在早期的软碟机上 (包括早期的麦金塔电脑)。
Various smartphones require the use of a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device.	有各式各样的智慧型手机需要使用如回纹针般的细长的物件来退出 SIM 卡，也有些 Palm PDA 装置会建议使用回纹针来重新设定装置。
The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel.	早期的罗技滑鼠装置会使用回纹针来打开档板，借此取出轨迹球。

A paper clip can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse.	回纹针可以暂时用来衔接熔断丝 (但并不安全)。
The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.	牙科可以使用回纹针的金属线来做成牙钉。
Paper clips can be bent into a crude but sometimes effective lock picking device.	回纹针可以弯折成简陋但有时候还挺有用的开锁工具。
Some types of handcuffs can be unfastened using paper clips.	有些类型的手铐可以用回纹针解开。
There are two approaches.	解锁方法有两种。
The first one is to unfold the clip in a line and then twist the end in a right angle, trying to imitate a key and using it to lift the lock fixator.	第一种是先将回纹针扳直成一条线，然后将一端扭成适合的折角，用来仿照钥匙将锁头的固定榫撬开。
The second approach, which is more feasible but needs some practice, is to use the semi-unfolded clip kink for lifting when the clip is inserted through the hole where the handcuffs are closed.	第二种方法较为可行，但需要多练习个几次，那就是将展开一半的回纹针插入手铐闭锁处的孔隙，然后试着将它撬开。
A paper clip image is the standard image for an attachment in an email client.	回纹针图案是在电子邮件客户端用来表示附件的标准图案。

The Band-Aid was invented in 1920 by a Johnson & Johnson employee, Earle Dickson in Highland Park, New Jersey for his wife Josephine, who frequently cut and burned herself while cooking.	Band-Aid OK 绷是由娇生公司 (Johnson & Johnson) 的员工于 1920 年所发明。这位员工是住在纽泽西州高地公园的 Earle Dickson，他为了经常在煮饭时切到或烫到自己的妻子 Josephine 发明了这项产品。
The prototype allowed her to dress her wounds without assistance.	这款 OK 绷的原型能够让她自行处理自己的伤口。
Dickson passed the idea on to his employer, which went on to produce and market the product as the Band-Aid.	Dickson 将这个点子递交给他的主管，随后就进行量产，并以 Band-Aid 做为产品名称在市场上贩售。
Dickson had a successful career at Johnson & Johnson, rising to vice president before his retirement in 1957.	Dickson 在娇生公司的职涯一帆风顺，于 1957 年退休之前晋升为副总裁。
Perhaps a curiosity, the word "Band" in German means tape.	补充一个小知识，「Band」这个字在德文中有「胶带」之意。
The original Band-Aids were handmade and not very popular.	原版的 Band-Aid OK 绷是以手工制成，在当时并未受到欢迎。
By 1924, Johnson & Johnson introduced machine-made Band-Aids and began the sale of sterilized Band-Aids in 1939.	到了 1924 年，娇生公司推出由机器制成的 Band-Aid OK 绷，并于 1939 年开始销售无菌版 OK 绷。
In 1951, the first decorative Band-Aids were introduced.	1951 年，第一款具有图案装饰的 Band-Aid OK 绷正式问世。
They continue to be a commercial success, with such themes as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Oliver & Jenny, Superman, Spider-Man, Rocket Power, Rugrats, smiley faces, Barbie, Dora the Explorer, Batman and Duck Dynasty.	这类 OK 绷的销售业绩持续长红，相继推出米老鼠、唐老鸭、《奥丽华历险记》(Oliver & Jenny)、超人、蜘蛛人、《火箭动力》(Rocket Power)、《淘气小兵兵》(Rugrats)、笑脸图案、芭比娃娃、《爱探险的朵拉》(Dora the Explorer)、蝙蝠侠和《鸭子王朝》(Duck Dynasty) 等联名主题款式。
In World War II, millions were shipped overseas, helping popularize the product.	在二次大战期间，有上百万片 OK 绷被运送到海外，助长了这项产品的销售人气。
Since then, Johnson & Johnson currently has estimated a sale of over 100 billion Band-Aids worldwide.	自此之后，据娇生公司估算，目前 Band-Aid OK 绷已经在全球销售超过千亿片。
Johnson & Johnson continues to defend the Band-Aid trademark against it being genericized.	娇生公司至今持续力守 Band-Aid 这个商标，不让它成为通用名称。
Band-Aid arguably has, over time, become a genericized trademark in the United States, and a generic term cannot function as a trademark; but Johnson & Johnson has registered Band-Aid as a trademark on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the registration is valid and legal.	「Band-Aid」一词随着时间的推移，至今可说是美国境内的通用商标，成为不具有专用商标资格的通俗名称。但娇生公司其实已经在美国专利商标局的主要注册簿上将 Band-Aid 注册为专用商标，而且该项注册至今仍有效且合法。
A registration on the Principal Register does not create ownership rights under the laws of the United States, and a registration may be challenged and removed if the challenger proves as a matter of fact that the alleged trademark has become generic.	根据美国的相关法律规范，在主要注册簿上注册商标并不等同于具有该商标的所有权。如果有人对某个注册商标提出异议，并提供事实证明该商标已经成为通用名称，则该注册商标有可能会遭到质疑或移除。
To protect the name, their trademark, Johnson & Johnson always refers to its products as "BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages", not just "Band-Aid".	娇生公司为保护自身商标权益，一律将这项产品称为「BAND-AID® 牌黏性绷带」，而非只是「Band-Aid」。
