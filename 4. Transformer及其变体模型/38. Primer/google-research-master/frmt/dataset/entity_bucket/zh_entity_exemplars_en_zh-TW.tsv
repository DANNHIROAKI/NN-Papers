He received a BFA from the Fine Arts Department at Tunghai University, and an MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York.	他畢業於東海大學美術系，取得美國紐約視覺藝術學院碩士學位。
He is known for using the cultural debris of our modern society, such as old, discarded books, newspapers, phonebooks, and magazines as the medium for his sculptures.	他最聞名的是以各種當代社會的文化垃圾，如被丟棄的舊書、舊報紙、電話簿、雜誌做為雕塑作品媒材。
Chen is self-taught in carving wood, but started showing interest in our paper culture as a viable material for art – phonebooks, magazines, and computer paper when PC’s began growing popular in 1993.	陳的木雕為無師自通，後來開始對利用紙文化做為創作素材感到興趣，包括電話簿、雜誌，1993 年因電腦開始普及，也用印表紙來創作。
The advent of the personal computer changed the entire nature of information documentation – a role books used to play.	個人電腦的發展，整個改變了資訊文件化的本質，原本由書扮演的角色遭到取代。
Thus, by turning paper into the original wood for his sculptures, Chen offers renewed value to the meaning of paper.	因此，陳透過將紙轉變成其木雕作品的材料，賦予紙全新的價值。
He uses chainsaws, drills, band saws, sanders, and scissors, along with other carpenter's tools to shape his remarkable busts and figures, which appear stone, or even marble like from a distance.	他使用鏈鋸、電鑽、砂紙、剪刀、以及各種木工工具，雕塑出他特別的胸像與人像，外觀看起來像石雕，遠看甚至像大理石。

For Chen, using recycled materials to make art stresses the challenges presented by endless human consumption and waste, as well as the tantamount ecological problems of waste accumulation and disposal, the destruction of forests, and the mindless use of nonrenewable resources.	對他來說，使用回收材料來製作藝術品，是在強調人類無止境的消費與浪費造成的挑戰，以及廢棄物累積造成的生態問題、森林破壞、以及濫用不可回收資源。
The reams of used computer paper disprove the assurance of the electronic paper-less office, which instead augments the use of paper, as printing is made much easier.	大量使用的電腦紙，否定了電子化無紙辦公室的承諾，因為列印更為方便，用紙量反而增加。
Furthermore, his choice of medium also poses as a commentary on the loss of books as aesthetic objects, which have been replaced by mass-produced cheaply made paperbacks.	另外，他選擇的媒材也反映出書本這種美學載體的失落，因為大量印製的平裝本書籍取而代之。
Books are extremely important to Chen.	對陳龍斌來說，書本非常重要。
However, it is not the book itself, but its educational heritage, literary importance, historical knowledge, and the sacredness of the written word that he treasures most.	但他最重視的並非書本本身，而是其教育傳承、文學重要性、歷史知識以及書寫的神聖性。
The type of materials he acquires in a sense determines the sculpture he creates.	這種有意識的媒材選用，決定其創造出的雕塑作品。
While in New York, he scoured the streets of Manhattan collecting discarded refuse, scouted offices for their rejected reams of paper, visited brownstone streets to gather cast off telephone books when new ones were distributed.	駐在紐約時，他經常巡遊曼哈頓街頭，收集被丟棄的廢物、找尋辦公室丟出來的大批廢紙，並在發放新電話簿時，到高級社區收集被丟出來的電話簿。
And now, living in Taipei, Chen obtains his material from university libraries and bookstores, publishing companies, archeological museums, and telephone companies.	現在陳住在台北，到大學圖書館、書店、出版社、考古博物館和電話公司收集素材。
The special quality of Chen's works is that people can still read the pages.	陳作品的特色，就是觀眾仍可翻閱書的內容。
“I try to make sculptures that are appropriate for the content of the books.	「我試著讓作品與書的內容相互配合。
In my concept, the form and content is united together; the content gives me the idea of the form.	我認為形式和概念是合一的；內容給我了形式的想法。
Yellow Pages give me one kind of idea; books discarded from libraries inspire different styles…" Often, his art reflects the content of the pages within, such as one hanging installation featuring spirals of books with peepholes in which one can view a scene from the story within the original pages.	黃頁給我一種想法；圖書館丟棄的書啟發另一種風格...」，他的作品經常反應書頁內容，例如有個以螺旋形排列書籍的吊掛作品，附有可以讓觀眾閱讀內頁文字的開孔。

As early as the late Qing dynasty, many vendors were already selling beef slices served cold in the streets of Chengdu, using beef offal because they were relatively inexpensive.	早在晚清時期，許多成都街頭商家，就以較便宜的牛內臟切成薄片來賣。
Because of its low cost, the dish was popular among rickshaw pullers and poor students.	由於售價低廉，這道菜很受人力車腳夫與窮學生歡迎。
In the 1930s, a married couple in Chengdu became famous for making beef slices.	1930 年，一對成都夫妻因為做牛片菜色而知名。
The husband, Guo Zhaohua (郭朝華), and wife, Zhang Tianzheng (張田政), were particular about the beef slices they made, and often experimented with new ingredients.	丈夫郭朝華與妻子張田政以其手製牛肉片聞名，經常實驗各種新成分。
As a result, their beef slices had a distinct taste from the other beef slice vendors, and their business boomed.	因此他們的牛肉片有獨特味道，與眾不同，生意因此興旺。
Often though, mischievous children would pull a prank on the couple, and stick paper notes that read fuqi feipian ("husband and wife lung pieces") on their backs, and sometimes people would yell the words out.	經常有調皮的孩子對他們惡作劇，把寫有「夫妻肺片」的紙片貼在他們背上，有時路人會大聲唸出來。
Later on, a merchant tried the fuqi feipian and was so satisfied, he gave them a gold-lettered plaque that read fuqi feipian, and the name has stuck ever since.	之後有個商人一試之下大為滿意，送了一塊金字匾額給他們，上書夫妻肺片，自此聲名大噪。
To suit their customers' tastes, the couple made many improvements on the dish, and offal slices were eventually replaced by various beef or lamb slices.	為滿足顧客的胃口，兩人針對菜色做了多次改進，內臟薄片最終被各種牛肉與羊肉片取代。
Many people still preferred calling the dish fuqi feipian, thus the name is still used today.	許多人還是喜歡把它稱為夫妻肺片，該名一直沿用至今。
The meaning of fei was originally waste parts or offal (廢) but later changed to lung (肺) so the dish sounded less repulsive.	Fei 本來意指廢，是不要的內臟，後來改成比較不具貶意的「肺」。
The lung could be a part of this offal, but fei is not lung by itself in this dish's meaning.	肺也是內臟的一種，但在這道菜中不是指肺部。
