## Invariant Slot Attention

This repository contains the code release for "Invariant Slot Attention: Object Discovery with Slot-Centric Reference Frames".
The code is derived from the [Slot Attention Video codebase](https://github.com/google-research/slot-attention-video).

## Instructions
> ℹ️ The following instructions assume that you are using JAX on GPUs and have CUDA and CuDNN installed. For more details on how to use JAX with accelerators, including requirements and TPUs, please read the [JAX installation instructions](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

Get dependencies and run model training via
```sh
./invariant_slot_attention/run.sh
```

Or use
```sh
git clone https://github.com/google-research/scenic.git
cd scenic
pip3 install .
cd ../
pip3 install -r invariant_slot_attention/requirements.txt
```
to install dependencies and
```sh
python -m invariant_slot_attention.main --config invariant_slot_attention/configs/tetrominoes/equiv_transl.py --workdir tmp/
```
to train the smallest Invariant Slot Attention model on 512 examples drawn from [Tetrominoes](https://github.com/deepmind/multi_object_datasets).

We provide configs and data loaders for six datasets: Tetrominoes, Objects Room,
MultiShapeNet-Easy, CLEVR, CLEVRTex and Waymo Open. The first four can be run
without explicit download or preprocessing, whereas CLEVRTex and Waymo Open
have to be manually downloaded a preprocessed. Please see the datasets folder.

For each dataset, we provide a config for a baseline and several invariant
Slot Attention models.
