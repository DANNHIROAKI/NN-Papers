This code was used to produce all empirical results for the paper "A Joint
Exponential Mechanism For Differentially Private Top-k".  To replicate results
for the books dataset, first download it from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks.
Save it as "books.csv" in this directory. Then use

> cd ..
> python -m dp_topk.run_experiment

to run experiments for the books dataset and generate error and time plots,
saved as books_[error_metric].png and books_time.png, respectively. Instructions
for other datasets appear in dp_topk.run_experiment.
