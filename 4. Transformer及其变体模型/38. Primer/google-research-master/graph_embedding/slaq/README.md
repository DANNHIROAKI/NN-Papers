Just SLaQ When You Approximate: Accurate Spectral Distances for Web-Scale Graphs
===============================

This is the implementation accompanying our WWW'2020 paper, [Just SLaQ When You Approximate: Accurate Spectral Distances for Web-Scale Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01282).

Example usage:
---
First, make sure you have the requirements `numpy` and `scipy`. You can always install the with `pip`: `pip3 install -r graph_embedding/slaq/requirements.txt`.

Then, to try the example code on the [Karate club graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club), run

```python
# From google-research/
python3 -m graph_embedding.slaq.example
```

The output shows approximation errors with the parameters used in the paper.
