The Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Judgment,
You worship, and You are our helper.
Guide us to the straight path.
The path of those whom You have favored, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who are astray.
Alif, Lam.
There is no doubt in this Book, and it is a guidance for those who fear Allah.
Those who believe in the unseen, and perform the prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been sent down to you, and what was sent down before you, and they are in the Hereafter.
These are those who are guided by their Lord, and they are the successful.
Those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil, and theirs is a great punishment.
And there are some among mankind who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers.
They deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive themselves, and they do not perceive.
There is a disease in their hearts, and Allah has increased their disease, and they will have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Make not mischief on the earth," they say: "We are only peacemakers."
Nay, they are the heedless, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Shall we believe in the fools?" They say, "Shall we believe?"
And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe, but when they are alone with their devils, they say: Lo! we are with you.
Allah mocks them, and they will have their power in the grave.
Those are the ones who have led astray the way of error, so their commerce will not profit them, nor will they be guided.
Their likeness is like the likeness of the Fire, when he kindled a fire from the fire, then Allah took away their light from their light, and that which they saw not.
Deaf, dumb, dumb, and blind.
Or as a rainstorm from the sky, darkness, thunder, thunder, thunder, their hearts, their hearts, their hearts, their hearts, their hearts, and Allah is the All-Seer of the disbelievers.
The light of their eyes has come away from the light, so that it may be its light, and when they are fixed therein, they are in it; and if they are fixed, they will have their hearing and their sight; and if Allah wills, He will surely have power over all things.
O people, worship your Lord who created you and those who were before you, so that you may fear Him.
He has made for you the earth a resting-bed, and the sky, and the sky, and He sends down rain from the sky; then He has provided for you fruits for which He has provided sustenance for you.
And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Surah like thereunto, and call your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful.
And if you do not, and you will not be able to do it, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds; for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they say, "This is what we have been given before," they say, "This is what we have been given before before us."
Allah does not like the parable of the Qur’an, nor is the likeness of those who believe, and those who believe, that they know that their Lord is the Truth from their Lord; and those who disbelieve say, "This is what is like this; and those who disbelieve say, 'This is what Allah has forbidden for them.'
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and make mischief in the land; they are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were dead, then He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you to life, and to Him you shall be returned.
He it is Who created for you all things that are in the earth, and He has made the heavens subservient to them; and He has full knowledge of all things.
When your Lord said to the angels, "I am going to place a vicegerent on the earth," they said, "Will you place it as it will be?" They said, "We celebrate Your praise and extol Your holiness."
And Adam taught Adam the names of all things, then presented them to the angels, and said: Tell Me the names of these if ye are truthful.
They said, "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us, and You are the Wise, the Wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names, and when He showed them their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth?"
And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they prostrated themselves, except Iblis, and he refused to be of the disbelievers.
And We said: O Adam, dwell in the Garden and your wife, and eat freely of what ye eat; and approach not the tree of this tree, lest ye be among the unjust.
Then Satan turned away from them, and caused them to go out of the land, and said: "Go forth from yourselves, you are enemies of yourselves, and for you is the abode of the earth."
Then Adam received his Lord's words, and He relented to him; surely He is the Oft-returning, the Merciful.
We said: Go forth from all of you, so that you may come to Me who follows My guidance, and there is no fear for Me, nor shall they grieve.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the dwellers of the Fire; therein they shall abide therein.
O children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant with you, and fear Me, and fear Me.
And believe in what I have sent down to you, and do not disbelieve in it, and do not disbelieve in My communications, and do not exchange My signs for a small price.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth.
And establish the prayer (Iqamat-Salat) and pay Zakah, and establish the Zakat (Iqamat-Salat) and those who bow (in prayer).
And do you enjoin the people with good deeds, and do you think that you are the People of the Book?
And seek help for patience and prayer, and it is difficult for those who are humble.
Those who think that they will meet their Lord, and to Him is the return.
O children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above the worlds.
And fear the Day when there shall be no avail for another soul, nor shall it be accepted from him, nor shall it be accepted from him, nor shall they be helped.

And when We parted the sea for you, We saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh and you were watching.
And (remember) when We took the calf for forty nights, then you took him on the calf, and you were wrongdoers.
Then We subjected to you after that that you may be grateful.
And (remember) when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion (Torah), so that you may be guided.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed you have wronged the calf, so turn your backs to your Lord, so turn your backs from your Lord. He is the best of those who are the best of you. He is the Most Forgiving, the Merciful.
And when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly."
Then We gave you death after your death, so that you may be grateful.
And We shaded you with clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails, saying: We have provided you with good things for you, and that which they do not wrong.
And when We said, "Go forth in this town, and eat from it wherever you wish, and enter in the gate, and say, 'Our sins will forgive you your sins, and do good for us.'

He said, "This is what is best for you."
Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Sabians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward with their Lord, and there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.

They said, "Call out to us your Lord for us to make clear to us what He has said." He said, "It is not like a cow, nor a man, nor is a man in between you."
They said, "Beseech your Lord to make us clear to us." He said, "He said, "It is like a cow." He said, "It is like a cow."
They said: Pray to your Lord for us to make plain to us what is like us; and if Allah wills, He will surely guide us.
He said: "It is not like a cow that is like a cow, nor a bird, nor a bird, nor a garden, nor a garden, and a food." They said, "Now you have come to you." They said, "Now, they did not have been allowed to do anything."
And when you slew a man, then you disputed, and Allah is with what you conceal.
Then We said: "Strike it in the midst of Allah, so that Allah may bring the dead to life, and He will show you His signs."
Then then your hearts are hardened, and though they are heavy, they are like a rock; and there are some of them who are watered from water, and there are some who are watered from water; and there is a watered rain from them, and it is a rain from Allah; and Allah is not unmindful of what you do.
Have you ever considered those who believe in you until they hear the word of Allah, so that they hear the word of Allah, and after that they were averse to it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe"; but when they meet each other with each other, they say: "Do you inform what Allah has revealed to you?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?
And there are signs among them who do not know the Book except the people of the Book, and they are but but they follow.
So beware for those who write their tongues to the Book, they say, "This is from Allah." They say, "This is from Allah, so that they may have a share for what their hands have earned."
And they say: "The Fire will not touch us but for a number of days." Say: "Have you taken a covenant from Allah?" Say: "Did Allah not breaks His promise on you, or that which ye know?"
For those who do evil deeds and their sins, they are the dwellers of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, these are the dwellers of Paradise; they will abide therein.
And when We said to the Children of Israel, "Worship none but Allah, and give parents to parents and orphans, and orphans and orphans, and the orphans, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the poor, and you will turn away."
And (remember) when We took you (O Muhammad SAW), (saying): "Do not shed your blood, nor leave your people from your homes, and then you will be witnesses, and you will be witnesses."
Then you will take your people away from his people, and from his people a people who are a people who are a people of a nation, and a group of people who are patient. And they are like a one of them, and they will not be able to leave you in the life of the Fire. They will have a share in the life of the Day of Resurrection, and the punishment of the Day of Resurrection will come to you, and they will come to you in the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, and they will be driven to you in the punishment of the Day of Resurrection.
They are the ones who buy the life of this world for the life of this world, and their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book, and We followed him, and We gave Jesus Jesus son of Mary, and strengthened them with the Holy Spirit, and strengthened them with the Holy Spirit.
And they say: Our hearts are wrapped in their hearts; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief.
And when the Book came to them from Allah, confirming what is with them, and when they come to them, then they desire that they disbelieve in it; then when they come to them, they reject it.
That is because they disbelieve in that which Allah hath sent down to them, and that Allah may surely bestow down His mercy on His servants whom He wills. And the wrath of Allah is with those who disbelieve, and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what has been sent down to us."
And indeed Moses came to you with clear proofs, so you took the calf, and you were the wrongdoers.

Say: "If the abode of the Hereafter is only for Allah, then there is no other than the people for you, if you are truthful."
And they will not wish for that which their hands have sent before them, and Allah knows best the wrongdoers.

If they had believed and feared Allah, they would certainly have taken out a better reward from Allah if they knew.
O you who believe! do not say, "Do not say, say, ‘Listen to the word of Allah, and listen to it."
The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) who do not believe in the Book of those who disbelieve, and from the idolaters, except for the permission of your Lord; and Allah will bestow His Mercy on whom He pleases, and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.

We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner to you, and you will not be questioned from the Fire.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor will they follow your religion until you follow your religion. Say: "This is the guidance of Allah." Say, "If you follow their desires, you will have no protector or helper."

And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would certainly have removed their sins and admitted them to gardens beneath which rivers flow.
And if they had been sent down to the Torah and the Gospel and the Gospel, they would certainly have taken out of their hands from their Lord, and from their feet, and their feet, and their feet, and most of them are the worst.
O Messenger, deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord; and if you do it not, you will not have conveyed His message; and Allah will protect you from the people; and Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.
Say: "O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), you shall not follow the Torah until you have reached the Torah and the Gospel, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord."
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
We took a covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent them messengers to them, but when their apostle came to them, they denied their own souls, and they were killed.
And they thought that it was not a trial, so they became blind and deaf; then Allah turned back to them, and most of them are blind; and Allah sees what they do.
Surely, they say: “The Messiah is Allah, the son of Mary, the son of Maryam (Mary), saying: 'O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.'
Those who say: "Allah is the One who is the One who is the One who is the Arabic, there is no god but He."
And why do they not turn away from Allah and ask forgiveness for him? God is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, is not a messenger; indeed many of them passed away before him; and his mother was averse to him, and his mother ate food; so see how they are deluded.
Say: "Do you worship besides Allah that which you do not harm or benefit? Allah is All-hearing, All-knowing."
Say: "O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), do not exceed the limits of your religion in religion and do not follow the inclinations of the people who have gone astray before they have gone astray, and they have gone astray from the path."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they disobeyed him, and they disobeyed him.
They did not forbid those who have done evil, and they have done what they used to do.
You see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is what they have sent before them, and that which they have been sent before Allah, and in the Hereafter they will abide.
And if they believe in Allah and the Messenger and what has been sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends, but most of them are transgressors.
And you will see the people of the Jews and the believers, and those who believe, and those who say, "We are Christians," and they say, "We are Christians," and they say, "We are the ones who are among them, and they are not proud."
And when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), they will see their eyes overflowing with tears; they say: "Our Lord, we have believed, so write us down among the witnesses."
And what is it that we believe in Allah and that which has been revealed to us from the truth, and that we hope for our Lord, our Lord?
And they say: Allah has prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide therein; and that is the reward of the righteous.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, these are the inmates of the Fire.
O you who believe! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress limits; surely Allah does not love the transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has provided for you and good things, and fear Allah in Whom you believe.
Allah has sworn to you in your oaths, that you may not stop your oaths, and that you may take out the feeding of the poor, and that you may not eat the feeding of the cattle, and that you may eat the feeding of the cattle, or the cattle, or the cattle, or the cattle, or the cattle, or the cattle, or the cattle, or the cattle, or the cattle, or the cattle, and the cattle, and the cattle, and the cattle, and the cattle, and the cattle, and the cattle, and that you may be grateful.
O you who believe! intoxicants and gambling, and divining arrows are the arrows of Satan, and the devils are Satan's handiwork, so that you may prosper.
Satan has forbidden the devils and gambling, and hatred, and gambling, and the remembrance of Allah, and the prayer of your Lord. Will you not then be helped?
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away, know that Our Messenger is only a clear messenger.
“Those who believe and do good deeds, they have no hope for what they have done, and those who believe and do righteous deeds, then they fear Allah and do righteous deeds, and believe in Allah, and Allah loves those who do good.”
O you who believe! Allah has given you what is in your hands, or your hands, or that it may test you, so that Allah may test those who fear Him, and that He will surely give him a painful punishment.
O you who believe! Do not be in the state of the land, and you shall know what you have killed, and if you die, then you shall have a portion of the like of the like of you; or if it be a result of a man, he will have a portion for you, or the feeding of the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the feeding of the poor; and Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
It is lawful for you for the sea, and it is for you for you, and for you is a provision and a provision for you; and you are the inhabitants of the land, and the land, and the cattle, and you are in the land.
It is Allah who has appointed the Ka’bah for the Sacred House, the Sacred House, and the month, and the month, and the month, and the garlands, that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger is only a messenger, and you conceal what you conceal and what you conceal.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The hypocrites and the hypocrites are not equal to you, even though the worst of the worst of the abundance of the Most Gracious (i.e. Allah has forbidden you), so that you may be of Allah, so that you may be successful."
O you who have believed, do not ask you about what you have concealed from the truth, and if you ask about the Qur’an, you will surely ask them about it; and if you ask about it, then Allah will forgive you.
A people before you asked you about it, and then they disbelieved.
Allah has not ordained a soothsayer, nor a prophet, or a friend, or a friend, or a friend, and the Unbelievers, and the unbelievers, and most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them: “Come to what Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger," they say: "Sufficient for us is that which our fathers found."
O you who have believed, when you are guided by your own souls, you will not harm your sins, but Allah will surely return to you, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who believe! if death approaches one of you, then it is better for you; then if you are in the land, then you are in the land, or you are in the land.
But if they know that they are guilty of the punishment of the two parties, they are two of those who have received their portion of their wives, and they swear by Allah, and they swear by Allah that they say: "Our testimony is truer than our testimony, and we do not have been unjust."
That is nearer to that which they have denied, or a witness of their oaths, or their oaths after their oaths; and fear Allah, and listen to him; and Allah does not guide the unjust people.
On the Day when Allah will gather His messengers, He will say: "What is the matter of us?" They will say: "We have no knowledge."
And when Jesus, Jesus, son of Mary, said, “My mother, I have vowed your name to you, and your mother, and your mother, who will help you with the religion of Allah, and that which He has given you of the Book, and that which is in the Book, and that which is in the Book, and that which is in the Book, and that which is in the Book, and that which is in the Book, and that which is in the Book, and that which is in the Book, and that which is not of my own accord, and that which is in the sight of Allah, that is naught but a manifest sorcery.”
And when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: We believe and bear witness that we are Muslims.
And when the disciples said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, has your Lord sent down to us a table from heaven?”
They said: "We wish that we may eat from it and satisfy our hearts, and know that you have been truthful, and we know that you are a witness."
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "Our Lord, send down to us a table from which He has sent down to us a festival and a festival for us, and a sign from your Lord."
He said, "I sent down to you a sign, and whoever disobeys you, I will surely punish him with a severe punishment."
And when Allah will say: "O Jesus Jesus, son of Mary, said: 'O Jesus, why is it that I say to you, besides Allah, my mother, and my mother, and He will say: "You are not a thing of me."
Never did I say to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord, and I was a witness over them; when Thou didst take me up, Thou wast a Watcher over them, and Thou art the Watcher over all things.
If You punish them, they are Your slaves; and if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.”
Allah will say: "This is a day that will profit them with their truth, for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will abide therein forever. Allah is pleased with them, and that is the supreme success."
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in the earth; and He is powerful over all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and the earth, and the light, and the light, and the light of the Unbelievers.
He it is Who created you from dust, then He has decreed a term for you, and a term for a term.
And He is Allah in the heavens and the earth; He knows what you conceal and what He knows.
They will not come to the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it.
Then they denied the truth when it came to them, but they mock at what they used to mock.
Do they not see how We have destroyed many generations before them, and We have established the earth in the earth, and We have not given you authority over which We have bestowed upon them, and beneath which rivers flow, and We have prepared for them rivers, and We have made them a new creation.
And had We sent down to you a Book in paper, then they would have touched it with their hands, and they would say: "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not been sent down to him from him?" And if We had sent down a angel, it would certainly have been decreed for him.
If We had sent him a angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and they would have been like a single man, and they would have been confused with their deeds.
Messengers were mocked before you, but the scoffers mocked with them.
Say: "Travel in the land and see how was the end of those who denied (the truth)."
Say: "To whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "This is Allah's mercy, and on the Day of Judgment, that He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection, on the Day of Judgment, and on the Day of Judgment, that they will not believe."
And to Him belongs all that is in the night and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Say: "Shall I take besides Allah a protector, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, and He gives sustenance and provision, and He will not provide any provision for him? Say: 'I am commanded to be the first of those who submit to Him."
Say, "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous Day."
On the Day when it is averted from him, Allah will surely have mercy on him, and that is the manifest triumph.
And if Allah touch you with affliction, there is none who can remove it but He, and if He touches you with good, He has power over all things.
And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Say: "What is it that is in the Arabic language, and say: 'I bear witness between you," and that which is revealed to you, and that which is revealed to you, and that which is in the Qur'an? Say: "Worship Allah!" Say: "I bear witness to Allah, and I do not bear witness to Him."
Those to whom We have given the Book know that they know their sons; they have lost their own souls.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or rejects His signs, or who does not know the unjust?
And on the Day when We gather them all together, We shall say to those who associate partners: "Where are your associates?"
Then they will say: "By Allah, we have no power to say: 'By Allah, we have no partners with Him.'
See how they invent falsehood against them, and they will be among them as they invented.
And there are some of them who listen to you, and We have made their hearts veils, and deafness in their ears, and deafness in their ears; and if they see every sign, they will not believe until they come to you.
And they take away from it, and they turn away from them, and they do not destroy except themselves, and they do not know.
And if you see them when they were driven to the Fire, they say: "Alas! If we return, we would not deny the Signs of our Lord, and we shall not be believers."
Nay, but those who were deluded before that which they were concealing, and if they return to it, they would certainly have been forbidden for what they have been forbidden.
And they say: "There is nothing but this but the life of this world, and we shall not be raised up."
And if you see them when they come to their Lord, He will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" They say, "Yes!" He will say, "Taste the punishment of your disbelief."
Those who deny the Meeting of Allah (i.e. the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), then when the Hour comes to them, they will say: "Woe to us!" And when the Hour comes to them, they say: Alas for us that which they have earned, and their backs is what they have done.
And the life of this world is nothing but amusement and amusement; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Will you not then understand?
We know that they will grieve you with what they say, but they say, "You deny the verses of Allah."
Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient until they were patient until Our help came to them, until Our help came to them, and Allah will not change the messengers.
And if their aversion is removed from you, then if you find a tunnel on the earth or a ladder, or bring a sign to them, or bring them a sign to them, and if Allah willed, He would have guided them all.
Those who listen to Him will be called to Him, and Allah will raise them on the Day of Resurrection.
And they say, "Why has not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "This is from Allah, and most of them do not know."
And there is no creature in the earth, nor its bird, nor bird as a bird; but there are some like you in the Book, and We do not follow the Book.
And those who reject Our signs are deaf and dumb in darkness; but Allah guides whom He wills and guides whom He wills.
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you, or the Hour, or the Hour, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but if He wills, He will call upon you, and if He wills you will be called to Him, and you will not forget what you associate.
And indeed We sent Messengers before you, and We seized them with hardship and hardship so that they might humble themselves.
But when Our punishment came to them, they were not able to do so, but their hearts were hardened, and their hearts were averse to them.
So when they forgot them when they forgot them, We opened them with every gate, and We seized them with what they had done, and they were in despair when they were in despair.
And the people of the people were cut off, and all praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds.
Say: "Have you considered, if Allah should take away your hearing and your sight, and your hearts, and your hearts, who is a god other than Allah? And We see the verses of this Qur'an."
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly or openly, will be destroyed except the wrongdoing people?"
And We sent the Messengers and the givers of glad tidings and warners; and those who believe and mend their deeds, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our signs (i.e. the Qur’an), they will have a painful torment.
Say: "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you, 'I am the angel of Gabriel, and I do not follow anything except what has been revealed to me." Say, "Are not the blind and the hypocrites?"
And warn those who fear their Lord with fear, for they have no protector, nor intercessor, nor intercessor, that they may fear Allah.
And do not turn away from those who call upon their Lord in the morning and evening, seeking His Face, and do not turn away from them for what you have earned, and you will not have any share for them.
And thus We made some of them so that they might say: "Are this the people whom Allah has favoured for us?"
And when those who believe in Our communications come to you, say: Peace be upon you, your Lord has decreed for Himself; so whoever repents and repents thereafter, then surely he who repents and repents thereafter, then he is the Forgiver, the Merciful.
And thus do We explain the signs (of the Qur’an), and it is clear to them that they may be led astray.
Say: "I have been forbidden to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah. Say: "I follow not your desires."
Say: "I am a clear proof from my Lord, and you deny it; you are the ones whom you desire."
Say, "If you were in your homes, you would have been in a state of what you have been in your homes; and Allah knows best the unjust."
And He knows what is in the Unseen, and He knows what is in the land; and He knows what is in the land and the sea; and there is not a leaf or a leaf, or a leaf, or a leaf, or a leaf, or a clear Record.
It is He who takes the night by night, and He knows what you have done; then He raises you up to the day; then He raises you to your return; then He will inform you of what you used to do.
And He is above His servants, and He sends over you a cloud over you, until when death overtakes you, Our angels will not die, and they will not be able to do.
Then they will return to Allah, the truth, the truth, and He is the All-Sufficient, the All-returning.
Say: Who saves you from the land of the land and the sea, when ye call upon Him in prayer, and when He delivers us from this (dangers)?
Say: "Allah will protect you from all of them and from every distress, then you will associate Him."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "It is He who has sent down to you from you a torment from your feet or from beneath you, or from you, or from you, or of you who disbelieve, and We make you taste the violence of others, so that they may reflect."
And your people deny it, and it is the truth, and say: I am not a keeper over you.
And every term will come, and you will know.
And when you see those who dispute in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), then turn away from them, but if you forget Satan, then do not follow the wrongdoing (polytheists and wrong-doers).
And those who fear Allah will not be able to do anything for them; so that they may fear.
And (as for) those who take a religion for their religion, and play themselves, and make them present in the life of this world, and do not warn them in the life of this world; and if they turn away, they shall have no protector, and they shall have no protector, nor shall they have any protector.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall we worship besides Allah that which is not lawful for us, nor does he harm us, and that Allah will not guide us for that which He has guided us?"
“And (remember) the Prayer (prayer), and fear (Him), and it is He Who is the One Who will be gathered to you, and He is the One Who will be gathered to you.”
And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth, and on the Day of Judgment, and on the Day when He will say: "This is the truth," and on the Day when the Trumpet will be blown; He is the Knower of the unseen, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Wise.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, "O idols, why do you take idols as gods?
And indeed We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, so that he might be of the believers.
And when he saw the night, he saw a star, he said: "This is my Lord!" Then when he said, "I do not love what I do."
And when he saw the moon rising, he said: "This is my Lord!" When it be said, "If my Lord will not guide me, I will surely be among those who go astray."
And when he saw the sun rising, he said: "This is my Lord!" But when he fell up, he said: O my people! I am innocent of what you associate with Allah.
"I have turned to him in the sight of Allah that He has created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the polytheists."
And his people argued with him, saying: "Will you dispute with me about Allah, in which He has guided me to me? I will not fear what you associate with me; my Lord is the All-Knower of all things."
How should I fear what you associate with Him, when you have no fear of Allah?
Those who believe, and do not believe, for their disbelief, and their disbelief, they are guided.
And this is our argument which We bestowed to Ibrahim (Abraham) to his people, that We may try for him whom We please; surely your Lord is Wise, Wise.
And We gave Abraham Isaac and Jacob, and We guided him, and his progeny, and his progeny, and Job, and Job, and Job, and Aaron, and Aaron, and Aaron, and Aaron, and We do not reward the doers of good.
And Zachariah, and John, and Jesus, and Elias, and all of the righteous.
And Ismail, Elisha, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot, and all of them We have given the worlds.
And We gave them their fathers, their brothers, their brothers, their brothers, and their brothers, and We guided them with a guidance.
Allah guides whom He will, and He guides whom He will.
They are the ones who have given the Book and the Wisdom and the Prophethood; but if they do not believe in it, We have prepared for them a people who disbelieve not.
They are the ones whom Allah has guided, so follow them. Say: "I ask not for you any reward for this."
And they did not believe in Allah's command, because they said: "Why has not been sent down to us from Allah," Say: "He has sent down to you the Book and the guidance, and that which you are commanded to do, and that which you have been hiding, and that which you hide, and that which you hide not."
And this is the Book which We have sent before you, confirming that which We have sent down before you, and that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those who believe in the Hereafter, and those who believe in the Hereafter.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or says, "What has been revealed to me, or that which has been revealed to me, or that which is revealed to me?" Say, "I have been sent down to the Book and the angels." And if you see the death of the angels, then the angels will bite their hands. And if you see it, then the angels will have a painful punishment.
And you have come to Us as We have created you, and We have made you behind your backs, and We have not seen you with your intercessors, and We see you with those who associate partners with you. Surely, your religion are between you, and you were among those whom you used to assert.
Allah has forbidden the grain of grain and the date-trees, and the living, and the living, and the dead, and the dead, and the dead, and it is that which ye are deluded.
He is the dawn, the day, the day, the night, the sun, the moon, the moon, the moon, the reckoning for it, and He is the Mighty, the Knowing.
And He it is Who has made for you the stars that He may make it for you, and the sea, and the sea, and in the sea We have made clear signs for people who understand.
And He it is Who has created you from a single soul, then is a resting-place, and a resting-place, and a resting-place, so We have explained for a people who understand.
And it is He Who sends down rain from the sky, and We produce therewith therewith fruits; We produce therewith therewith from it, and from which rivers flow, palm trees, palm trees, palm trees, palm-trees, palm-trees, and palm-trees, and palm-trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, therein are a sign for a people who believe.
And they have created the jinn besides Allah, while He created them with knowledge and knowledge. Glory be to Him, and He is exalted over what they describe.
Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and He has taken a son, and He has created all things, and He has created all things?
Your Lord is Allah, there is no god but He, the Creator of all things, and He is the Creator of all things.
He perceives not His eyes, and He sees all things; and He is the Subtle, the Wise.
There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord; so whoever sees it, he will have his own loss, and whoever goes astray, it is for his own loss; and I am not a keeper over you.
And thus We have explained in detail to the Qur’an that they may say: "You have studied the Qur’an, and that which is in it, so that they may know."
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, there is no deity but He, and turn away from the idolaters.
And if Allah had willed, they would not have taken up (others), and We have not made you a watcher over them; and you are not of them as a guardian.
Do not abuse those whom they invoke besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully. Thus We have made fair deeds for every nation, so that they may return to their Lord, and they will return to their Lord, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swear by Allah that if a sign came to them, they believe in it, and say: "These are the Signs of Allah."
And We shall turn their hearts to their hearts, and their eyes, and they will not believe in it, and We will make them wander blindly in blindly blindly.
And if We had sent down to them the angels, and the dead were spoken to them, and We made all things with their eyes, they would certainly have believed in Allah; but if they had not believed, they would not believe.
And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy from every prophet and the jinn, and the devils, and some of the devils; and if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it.
And so that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to them, so that they may be able to give it to themselves, and they will have their deeds.
"Shall I seek other than Allah as He Who has sent down to you the Book which He has sent down to you, and that which is revealed to them from your Lord?
And the word of your Lord is true in truth and in justice: None can change His words; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from the path of Allah.
Your Lord knows best those who go astray from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
If you believe in God, then you will have to believe in Him.
And what is it that you do not eat of Allah's name which He has forbidden for you, and that which Allah has forbidden for you? And most of them are averse to their own desires; surely most of them are misguided.
And avoid the sin of sin and sin; for those who commit evil deeds will be recompensed for what they used to do.
And do not eat of what Allah has not mentioned for you; surely indeed, it is severe for the devil and the devils; and if you obey them, then you will surely be among you, and if you obey them, you will surely be among those who are liars.
Who gave him life, and We gave him a light, and We have made him a light to the people who are blind, like the like of the blind, who is the like of the like of the blind? This is not for those who disbelieve.
And thus We destroyed every city in every town, so that they might transgress in it, and they deceive none but themselves, and they do not know.
And when a sign comes to them, they say: "We believe not in Allah's Messengers, but when We believe in Allah's Messenger, they will not believe therein."
And Allah guides whom He wills to his religion, and He guides whom He will, and He makes his chest as though He sends down the sky as though they are climbing down as though they are climbing up.
And this is the Straight Path from your Lord, so We have explained Our signs for people who believe.
They will have their abode with their Lord, and their guardian is their guardian.
And on the Day when He will gather them all together, and He will say: "O men of the jinn, you have made a number of people among you, and the people will say: 'Our Lord! We have made for you a portion of others, and We have appointed a term for you.' He will say: "Enter the Fire."
And thus do We make the wrong-doers for those who do wrong for what they used to do.
Did not Messengers come to you from among the jinn and the jinn, reciting My Signs to you, and warning you from the Day of Resurrection? They say, "We bear witness that we bear witness against them." They will say, "We bear witness," and they testify against themselves.
That is because your Lord is not going to destroy the towns, but they are the people who are heedless.
And they shall have degrees for what they have done, and your Lord is not unmindful of what they do.
And your Lord is Self-sufficient, Most Merciful, and if He wills, He will take you out of your sins, and He will raise you from the like of the nations as He wills.
Verily, it is that which you have promised, and you will not be able to escape.
Say, "O my people, you have done your deeds; surely you will surely know what is in the Hereafter; then you will know that the righteous will not prosper."
And they assign to Allah a portion of what He has created for cattle and cattle. They say, "This is for Allah." They say, "This is for our partners." And they associate their partners with Allah, and that they associate their partners with Allah, and that they associate their partners with Allah. Evil is what they used to do.
And indeed, Allah has forbidden their associates to those who associate their partners with their own sons, so that they would destroy them, and their religion are averse to their religion; and Allah will not wish that they would have been deceived.
And they say: "We feed cattle and cattle, and eat for the crops which We have forbidden for you, and they are forbidden for cattle, and they are forbidden for cattle, and they do not remember Allah's name, and they will not be able to mention Allah."
And they say: "This is what is in the bellies of the cattle, for that which is in the cattle, and for our wives." But if they die, they shall have their share in it; and if they die, they will have their reward; surely Allah is Knowing, Wise.
