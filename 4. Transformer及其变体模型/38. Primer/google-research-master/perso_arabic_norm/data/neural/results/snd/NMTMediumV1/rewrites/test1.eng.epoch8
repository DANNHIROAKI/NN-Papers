The All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Resurrection.
We worship Thee, and You help us.
Guide us to the straight path.
The path of those on whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who are astray.
Alif Lam Mim.
This is the Book, there is no doubt about it, and it is a guidance to those who fear Allah.
Who believe in the unseen, and establish prayer and spend out of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was revealed before you, and they are certain of the Hereafter.
These are on a straight path from their Lord, and it is those who are successful.
As for those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.
Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; and theirs is a great punishment.
And some of the people say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers.
They deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none but themselves, and they perceive not.
In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has increased their disease, and for them is a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them: Do not cause corruption on the earth, they say: We are only peacemakers.
Indeed, they are the corrupters, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people believe," they say, "Shall we believe as the fools believe?"
And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe, but when they are alone with their devils, they say: Lo! we are with you; we are only mocking.
Allah will mock them and they will be in their rebellion in their rebellion.
These are the ones who have purchased error for guidance, so their commerce has no profit, nor are they guided.
Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire, and when it illuminated all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness.
deaf, dumb, dumb, and they will not return.
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, and the thunder, and the thunder, and the lightning, they thrust their fingers in their ears, fearing death. And Allah encompasses the disbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away from their eyes; when it comes to them, they walk in it, and when it comes to them, they stand therein; and if Allah wills, He would have seen their hearing and their sight; surely Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous.
Who has made the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy, and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth therewith fruits for your sustenance; then do not set up rivals to Allah.
And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our slave (Muhammad SAW), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do not do it, and never will you do it, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds; for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow; whenever they are given fruit, they say, "This is what we have been given before," and it will be given to them, "This is what we have been given before."
Allah is not ashamed of anything less than a gnat, nor a gnat, but those who believe, know that it is the truth from their Lord. And those who disbelieve say: What is this parable which Allah has revealed to you? And He causes many of them to err. He does not guide the transgressors.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after it has been confirmed, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the land; these are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will cause you to die, then to Him you will be returned?
It is He Who has created for you all things in the earth, then He has made the heavens, and made them subject to the heavens; and He has knowledge of all things.
When your Lord said to the angels, "I am putting a successor on earth," they said, "Will you place someone who will make corruption in it and shed blood, and shed blood, and proclaim Your praise?" He said, "I know what you know not."
And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels and said, "Tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-Knowing, the All-wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names, and when He gave them their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that you know what you reveal and what you reveal?"
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam," but they prostrated themselves except Iblis, and he was haughty and he became one of the disbelievers.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat of the bountiful things therein, and do not approach this tree, lest ye be of the transgressors.
Then Satan made them slip and made them go out of it; and We said, "Go down into the land," and We said, "Go down into the land," and for a time, and for a time, it is a place of security and provision.
Then Adam received words from his Lord, and He relented towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
We said: "Get down all of you, all of you, and if there comes to you guidance from Me, then whosoever follows My guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve."
But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they are the dwellers of the Fire; therein shall they abide forever.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil My covenant with Me, and fear Me.
And believe in that which I have sent down, confirming that which is with you, and be not the first of those who disbelieve, and do not sell My communications for a small price, and fear Me.
And do not confound the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth while you know.
And establish prayer, and give zakah, and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you bid people to do good deeds, and do you think that you are the Book of the Book? Do you not understand?
And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult for the humble.
Who think that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you over the worlds.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall they be helped.
And (remember) when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who were afflicting you with severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women. And in that was a tremendous trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people while you were watching.
And when We appointed for Musa forty nights, then you took the calf for the calf, and you were unjust.
Then We forgave you after that, so that you might be grateful.
And recall when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion that you may be guided.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves for the calf, so turn to your Maker and kill yourselves. That is better for you. He has mercy on you. He has mercy on you. He is the All-forgiving, the All-merciful."
And (remember) when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly."
Then We raised you up after your death, that you may be grateful.
And We caused the clouds to overshadow you, and We sent down to you manna and quails, saying: Eat of the good things which We have provided you. And they did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves.
And (remember) when We said, "Enter this town, and eat from it wherever you desire, and enter the gate, and say: 'Our sins, we forgive you, and we will forgive you your sins, and we shall be the best of the righteous.'
But those who did wrong changed the word that had been given to them, so We sent down upon them a plague from heaven, and We sent down upon them a punishment from heaven.
And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, "Strike your staff with your staff." Then twelve springs gushed forth from twelve springs; each tribe gushed forth from each other. Eat of the provision of Allah and do not act corruptly on the earth, and do not make mischief in the land.
And you said, "O Moses, we will not be patient until you are patient, so pray for us for your Lord, your Lord, the earth, the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds." He said, "Do not be patient.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And when We took a covenant from you and raised the Mount above you, saying, "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you may fear God."
Then you turned away after that, and if it were not for the grace of Allah and His mercy, you would surely have been among the losers.
And you know of those who were among you concerning the Sabbath, so We said to them: Be ye apes, despised and hated.
So We made it a lesson for the people of the towns and the latter generations, and a reminder for the pious.
And when Moses said to his people, "God commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Do you ridicule us?" They said, "I am the ignorant."
They said, "Call upon us for your Lord to make clear to us what it is." Moses said, "He says, "It is not like a cow, nor a young woman, nor a young woman."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make clear to us what it is." He said, "He says, "This is a yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow, whose color is yellow."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make clear to us what it is." And if Allah wills, we will surely be guided. And if Allah wills, we will surely be guided.
He said, "He said, "It is a cow that does not make the earth, nor the trees, nor the trees, nor any food." They said, "Give them a sign." They said, "Give them a sign, and they will not be able to escape."
And when you killed a man, and disputed about it, and Allah was to bring forth what you were hiding.
So We said, "Strike the part of some part of it. Thus Allah brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you may understand."
Then, after that, your hearts are hardened, though they are like a small wind, and they are not like a small wind; and there are some of them that gush forth from beneath the ground; and some of them are like water; and some of them are not afraid of it; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you hope that they should believe in you, while a party of them heard the word of Allah, then they understood it after they understood it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they meet one another, they say, "Do you tell them what God has disclosed to you?" They will say, "Do you tell them what God has revealed to you?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?
And among them are those who do not know the Book of the Book, but they do not know, but they are only conjecture.
So woe to those who write down their Book, and say, "This is from Allah," so they say, "This is from Allah," so that it may be a little for them, so woe to them for what they have earned, and woe to them for what they have earned.
And they say, "The Fire will not touch us except for a few days." Say, "Have you taken a promise from God?" Say, "God will not break His promise, or do you know what you do not know."
Nay, whoever earns evil and his sins are the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, these are the dwellers of Paradise; they shall abide therein forever.
And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: Worship none but Allah, and do good, and to parents, and to the near of kin, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and to speak to thee, and establish regular charity, and pay the poor-rate, and ye have turned away.
And (remember) when We made a covenant with you (saying): "Do not shed blood from your people, nor turn your people out of your homes, and you have borne witness."
So you were killed, and the people of his people were killed, and the people of his people were able to help one another, and some of them We asked of you, and they were like that which they were given. And if they were with you, they would not be able to make it lawful for you, and they will have a share of what they have done. And the punishment of the Day of Resurrection will not be returned to you. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
These are the ones who bought the life of the world for the life of this world, so their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And We gave Moses the Book and We sent messengers after him; and We gave Jesus the son of Mary, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit, and We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit, and when there came to you a messenger, you became arrogant, and you slew a lie.
And they say, "Our hearts are uncircumcised." Nay, God has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe in it.
And when the Book has come to them from Allah, confirming that which is with them, and that which is before them, they seek help for the disbelievers, and when it comes to them, they disbelieve in it, and the curse of Allah is upon the disbelievers.
Evil is that which they have sold, because they disbelieve in that which Allah has sent down, that Allah may bestow down His grace upon whomsoever He wills of His servants. So they have incurred wrath on the wrath of Allah, and there is a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us," but they disbelieve in what was sent down to them. And it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say, "Why did you kill the prophets of Allah?"
Moses came to you with clear proofs, and you worshipped the calf, and you were unjust.
And when We took a covenant from you and raised the Mount over you, saying, "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and listen to it." They said, "We hear and we do not believe," and their hearts took the calf for their disbelief. Say, "What is the matter for you that you are believers?"
Say: "If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you specially and not for other people, then wish for death if you are truthful."
And they will never long for it, because of what their hands have earned, and Allah knows the wrongdoers.
And thou wilt find them in the life of a people who are idolaters, and the idolaters. Each one of them wishes to be a thousand years; each one of them will be able to save him from a thousand years, and he will not be able to save him from the punishment, but Allah sees what they do.
Say, "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, he has sent it down to your heart by Allah's permission, confirming that which came before it, and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers."
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael, then surely Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.
We have sent down to you clear signs, and none will deny them except the transgressors.
Is it that when they hear a promise, it is a party of them, but most of them do not believe?
And when there came to them a messenger from Allah confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they were not aware.
And the followers of the devils, after that, had been sent down to the devils, and made the devils, but they disbelieved, and the devils disbelieved, and the devils did not believe in the magic of the people. And they did not know that they were the ones who had been sent down to the earth. And they were not in the presence of the people, and they were not in the midst of the people. And they were not in the presence of the people, and they had no power to be able to save them.
And if they had believed and guarded (against evil), the reward of Allah would have been better for them, if they but knew.
O you who believe! Do not say Unzurna, say Unzurna, say, "Listen and listen." And the disbelievers will have a painful punishment.
The People of the Book and those who disbelieve not wish for any good among you from your Lord, and Allah chooses for His mercy whom He pleases; and Allah chooses for His mercy whomsoever He pleases.
Whatever verse We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?
Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah and that you have no protector or helper besides Him?
Would you desire to question your Messenger, when Moses was asked to be questioned, and he who believes in the faith of a believer has gone astray.
Many of the People of the Book wish that they would turn you back after faith after you have believed, after the truth has become clear to them, after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook, until Allah brings His command. Allah has power over all things.
And establish prayer and pay the poor-rate, and whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah; surely Allah sees what you do.
And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." They are their own desires. Say, "Bring your proof if you are truthful."
Nay, but whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is a doer of good, he shall have his reward from his Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews say, "The Christians are nothing but the Christians," and the Christians say, "The Jews have no faith," but they recite the Book, so that they do not know what they do not know. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ.
And who is more unjust than he who forbids the name of Allah, that His name should be celebrated in the mosques of Allah, and strives for their ruin? They will not be able to change them except in fear. For them is disgrace in this world and theirs in the hereafter.
And to Allah belong the East and the West; so whither ye turn, thither is the Face of Allah; surely Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
They say, "Allah has taken a son." Glory be to Him. Glory be to Him, and to Him belongs all things in the heavens and on earth; all are all submissive to Him.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decreeth a matter, He says, "Be!" and it is.
And those who do not know say, "Why does Allah not speak to us, or to bring us a sign?" And those who have passed before them say, "Their hearts are like those who have passed away before them." They are like a people who believe.
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the companions of the Blazing Fire.
And the Jews will not be satisfied with you nor will the Christians follow you. Say, "The guidance of Allah is the guidance of the guidance." And if you follow their vain desires, then you will not have any protector or helper from Allah.
Those to whom We have given the Book read it, as they read it. They believe in it, and whoever does not believe in it, they are the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.
And guard yourselves against a day when no soul shall avail another, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be accepted from them, nor shall they be helped.
And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words, and he fulfilled him, and he said, "I am going to make you a leader for people." He said, "I am going to make a covenant between you." He said, "My son, I will not make the wrong-doers."
And when We made a covenant for the people and the people of the House, and We made a place of worship for Abraham and the Ka'bah, and We enjoined Abraham and Ishmael, and We commanded Abraham and Ishmael and those who bow down, and those who bow down and prostrate.
And (remember) when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this a City of Peace and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said, "I give life to those who believe in it, and I will punish him for the punishment of the Fire.
And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, they prayed, "Our Lord, accept this from us; You are the Hearing, the Knowing."
Our Lord, make us submissive to You, and make a distinction between our offspring, and to our offspring, and give us our rites, and forgive us. You are the All-forgiving, the All-merciful.
Our Lord, send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And who does not follow the religion of Abraham except that which he has chosen? We chose him in this world, and in the hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I submit to the Lord of the worlds."
And Abraham instructed his sons and Jacob, saying, "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you the religion, so do not die except as Muslims."
When death came to death, when he said to his sons, "What will you worship after me?" They said, "We worship God, your God, the God of your fathers, Abraham and Isaac, the God of Isaac, the One God, and to Him we submit."
This is a nation who have passed away; for them is what they have earned, and for what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
And they say, "Become Jews or Christians," say, "you are rightly guided." Say, "We follow Abraham's religion, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say: "We believe in Allah and that which was sent down to us, and that which was sent down to Abraham and Ishmael, and Isaac and Jacob, and the tribes and the tribes and the prophets and the prophets, and We make no distinction between any of them.
So if they believe in you, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, they are in schism; but Allah will suffice you against them; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
“And the religion of Allah, and who is better than he who is better than Allah?
Say, "Do you dispute with us concerning God, while He is our Lord and your Lord? And for us is our deeds and for you, and we are sincere to Him."
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, "Are you better than God?" Say, "Do you know better than that? God is not unaware of what you do."
This is a nation who have passed away; for them is what they have earned, and for you is what you have earned, and you will not be questioned concerning what they did.
The foolish among the people will say, "What has turned them away from the direction which they have received?" Say, "The East and the west belong to Allah. He guides whom He pleases."
And thus We have made you a middle community, that you may be witnesses over the people, and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) may be a witness over you, and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) will be a witness over you. And whoever turns away from the way of the Prophet (Muhammad SAW), We will surely make you taste a witness except that which you turn back on his heels. And Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
We see the turning of the heaven. We will surely turn you to a qiblah that will surely turn you towards the Sacred Mosque. So turn your faces towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are, turn your faces towards the Sacred Mosque. Those who have been given the Book know that it is the truth from their Lord. God is not unaware of what they do.
And if you bring to those who have been given the Book all the people of the Book, they will not follow your qiblah, nor will you follow their qiblah, nor will they follow any one of them.
Those to whom We have given the Book know it as they recognize their sons, but most of them know the truth.
The truth has come to you from your Lord, so be not of the doubters.
And every one has a direction, so that he may turn towards it; and in the way of righteousness, you will be gathered; wherever you are, Allah will bring you together; surely Allah has power over all things.
And wherever you turn forth, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you go forth, turn your faces towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it. So do not be afraid of them except those who are unjust. Do not fear them, but fear Me, and that you may be guided.
As We have sent among you a messenger from your own, reciting to you Our Signs, and purifying you, and teaching you the Book and Wisdom, and teaching you that which you did not know.
So remember Me, and remember Me, and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful to Me.
O you who believe! seek help in patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the patient.
And do not say of those who are slain in the way of Allah, "They are dead," but they are dead, but you do not perceive.
And We will test you with a test and a test, and in the crops and of the crops and of the crops and the fruits, and give glad tidings to the patient.
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say, "We belong to Allah, and to Him we shall return."
They are those on whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.
And the Safa and the Marwah are among the signs of Allah. So whoever performs the House or performs the pilgrimage, there is no sin on him. And whoever does good, then surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, All-Knowing.
Those who reject the truth and the guidance which We have sent down to them, after it has been revealed to them in the Book, and the curse of God, and it will curse them with the curse of the curse.
Except those who repent and make amends, and make clear their deeds, for I am the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, on them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all mankind.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
And your God is One God; there is no god but He, the Gracious, the Merciful.
He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the alternation of the night and the day, and the ships, and the ships, and the sea, and the sea, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and in the earth, there are signs in the sight of Allah.
And among the people are some who ascribe equals to Allah, as they love Him, as they love Him. And those who believe in the love of Allah, and those who do not know that they see the punishment when they see the punishment when they see the punishment, and that Allah is severe in punishment.
When those who are followed will be followed by those who followed them, and they will see the punishment and their ties between them.
And those who will say: "If we return to the truth, we shall certainly disown them." Thus Allah will show them their deeds in their deeds, and they will not be able to escape the Fire, and they will not be able to escape the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is in the earth and good things, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your open enemy.
He enjoins you to do evil and indecency, and that you speak about Allah that which you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say, "We follow what we found our fathers." Even even though their fathers did not know what their fathers did not know, nor were they guided.
The parable of those who disbelieve is like the parable of those who hear nothing like that which they hear, a call and a cry, deaf, dumb, dumb, so they do not understand.
O you who have believed, eat from the good things which We have provided for you and give thanks to Allah, if it is Him that you worship.
It is not for you to die, and blood, and blood, and the blood of swine, and that which is invoked by other than Allah. But whoever is driven by necessity, neither desiring nor exceeding the limit, nor shall he be guilty of sin; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
As for those who conceal the Book of Allah, they will not be able to purchase a small price in their bellies, and they will not be able to enter the Fire, but Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them; for them is a painful punishment.
They are the ones who have purchased error for guidance and forgiveness for forgiveness. How terrible is the Fire.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to the truth, and those who differ in the Book are in a great schism.
You will not be able to call the East and the West and the <unk>. Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the prophets and the prophets and the prophets and the prophets and the prophets and the orphans and the Prophets, and the orphans, and the needy, and the orphans, and the needy, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and those who are the pious.
O you who believe! <unk> will be decreed for you in order to be prescribed for you, and it is forbidden for the woman who is pregnant, and the woman who takes a wife from his brother, so that he may be a slave of his brother. And whoever does not follow his brother, then he will have a share of it. It is a mercy from your Lord, and whoever exceeds it after it is a painful punishment.
And there is life for you in retaliation, that you may guard (against evil).
"When death approaches one of you, if he leaves any property, he will give a bequest to the parents and near relatives.
But whoever changes it after he has heard it, the sin of the sin will be only upon them; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
But whoever fears a sin or a sin, then make a distinction between the parties and the parties who make a mistake; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may guard against evil.
The days of a appointed time, and whoever among you is sick or a journey on the day of reckoning, it is for the other, and whoever is able to take it, it is for the feeding of the poor; and whoever does good, it is better for him; but if you do not know, it is better for you.
The Qur'an is revealed in the Qur'an that the Qur'an is revealed to the people who have been guided.
And when My servants ask you concerning Me, I am indeed close to Me; and when I call upon Me, they respond to Me, so that they may respond to Me, and believe in Me, that they may walk in the right way.
It is lawful for you to be lawful to your wives in the night of the night. They are a garment for you, and you are a garment for yourselves. Know that you are enemies of your enemies. He will forgive you. He will forgive you and forgive you, so that you may not be able to eat. So do not approach them in the way of darkness. So do not approach them. God makes clear His revelations to you. So do not approach them. God makes clear His revelations to people that they may guard.
And do not consume the property of your wealth, nor make it lawful to them, nor do you allow the property of the people to devour the property of the people, while you know what you know.
They ask you concerning the Qur'an, and say: "It is for the people," and say: "It is for the people, and the appointed time for the time." And it is not that ye enter the houses, but it is good for them. And enter their houses, and fear Allah, that ye may prosper.
“Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors.”
And slay them wherever you find them, and kill them wherever you drove out from them. And if they fight you, then kill them until they fight with you. And if they fight you, then kill them; for the disbelievers is the recompense of the disbelievers.
But if they desist, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And fight them until there is no persecution, and the religion is only for Allah; but if they desist, then there is no hostility except against the oppressors.
The sacred month of the sacred month is a sacred month. So, if you commit adultery, then do not commit adultery. So, if you are guilty of sin, then fear Allah and know that Allah is with the pious.

Say, "The grace of Allah is in the hand of all that you have been given. He gives it to whom He pleases; and Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
He grants it to whomsoever He pleases, and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
And among the People of the Book are those who give you credit, if you give them a credit, and among them is one of them; and among them is a group of them who do not believe in it. That is because they say, "There is no blame on us." That is because they say, "We are not responsible for the ignorant."
Nay, but whoever fulfills his pledge and fears Allah, then surely Allah loves those who fear Him.
Those who sell the covenant of Allah and their oaths as a small price for a small price will not be in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and theirs will be a painful punishment.
And among them are some who twist their tongues in the Book, that you may think that it is not the Book of the Book, and it is not from the Book, and they say, "This is from Allah"; and they say, "This is from Allah," and they say, "This is not from Allah."
It is not for any human being that Allah has given the Book and wisdom, and He says to the people, "Be sincere to Me," and say to the people, "I am commanded to worship the Lord and the Book."
He does not order you, and the angels, and the prophets, so that you may disbelieve in it, and then will you disbelieve in it?
And (remember) when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets (saying): "I gave you the Book and Hikmah (wisdom) which I have come to you, confirming that which is with you, you must believe in him and help him."
Then whoever turns away after that, they are the transgressors.
Are they seeking a religion other than Allah, and whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned?
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us, and what has been revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Tribes, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and We make no distinction between any of them.
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How can Allah guide those who disbelieved after they had believed, and they bore witness that the Messenger had come with the truth, and that the Clear Signs came to them? Allah does not guide the unjust people.
These are the ones who will be punished with the curse of Allah and the angels and all the people of all mankind.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
Except for those who repent after that and make amends; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who disbelieve after their belief and then disbelieve in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted, and they are astray.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, there shall not be accepted from them the earth, the earth, if they offer it as ransom, and they shall have no helpers.
By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend of that which you love; and whatever you spend, Allah knows it well.
All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what was forbidden to the Children of Israel, and say, "Bring down the Torah, if you are truthful."
Then whoever forges a lie against Allah after that, they are the wrongdoers.
Say, "God has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the polytheists."
Indeed, the House of House, the House of House, is a guide and a guidance for the worlds.
There are signs in the Clear Signs. And whoever enters it, it is safe for him; and the House of Allah (i.e. the House of Abraham) is a place of security for the people, and the people who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism). And whosoever disbelieves, then Allah is Self-sufficient of the worlds.
Say: "O People of the Book! why do ye not believe in the Signs of Allah, and Allah is Witness over what ye do?"
Say: "O People of the Book! Why do you hinder the people of the Book from the way of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, while you are witnesses? And Allah is not unaware of what you do."
O you who have believed, if you obey a group of those who have been given the Book, they will turn you back after you have believed.
And how can you disbelieve when the verses of Allah are recited to you, and His Messenger is in you? And whoever holds fast to Allah, He will guide him to a straight path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims.
And keep fast to the rope of Allah, and do not be divided between them; and remember Allah's favour upon you, and that you may be united with the enemies of Allah, and He made your hearts your brethren, and you were in the midst of the Fire, and you were saved from it. Thus Allah makes clear to you His communications, so that you may be guided.
And there is a group of you who invite to good, and enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil; and these are the successful.
And be not like those who are divided among themselves and become divided in disputations after receiving Clear Signs: for them is a great Penalty.
On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be black, and those whose faces will be black will be asked, "Did you reject faith after accepting it? So taste the punishment for your disbelief."
And those whose faces are whitened will be in the mercy of Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the signs of Allah, which We recite to you in truth; and Allah does not desire the wrong-doers.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth; and to Him are all things to return.
You are the best of the nations. You are the people of the world. You enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong, and believe in Allah. And if the followers of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them; and most of them are transgressors.
They will not harm you except a little, and if they fight against you, they will turn their backs on you, and they will not be helped.
They will have a curse from Allah and a people who are a people of gold, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they have been afflicted with the wrath of Allah and has been made with them. That is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and did not kill the prophets. That is because they disobeyed the signs of Allah and were killed.
They are not all alike, and among the People of the Book is a community who recite the signs of Allah in periods of the night, and they prostrate themselves.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and vie with the righteous. They are among the righteous.
And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it, and Allah knows the pious.
As for those who disbelieve, neither shall their wealth nor their children avail them aught against Allah. They are the dwellers of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
The example of the life of this world is as a likeness of the harvest which is in the heat of the wind, and the harvest of the people of the harvest, and it destroys it, and it destroys it, and Allah does not wrong them.
O you who believe! Do not take for friends as friends other than your own friends, but they do not harm you. They love that which they desire; vehement hatred from their mouths; and what their breasts conceal is greater than what their breasts conceal; indeed, We have made clear to you the signs.
It is you who love them, and they do not love you, and you believe in the Book, and when they meet you, they say, "We believe"; when they meet you, they bite their fingers in rage by rage. Say, "Die in your rage; God knows what is in the breasts."
If good befalls you, it grieves them; but if evil befalls you, they rejoice at it; but if you are patient and fear Allah, their guile will not harm you; surely Allah encompasses what they do.
(Remember) when you went forth from your home in the morning, for the believers in the battle, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
When two parties of two parties were destroyed, and God had helped them, and they put their trust in God.
And Allah had helped you at Badr, when ye were a contemptible little force; so fear Allah, and be careful of that which ye may be thankful.
When you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down?"
Yes, if you are patient and guard against evil, then they will come to you with a thousand thousand angels, and you will help him with a thousand angels.
And Allah has not made it but a good news for you, and that your hearts may be secure. And Allah is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
That He may cut off a fringe of those who disbelieve, or expose them to infamy, so that they may turn back.
You have not been responsible for the decision, or He will punish them, or punish them for that they are wrongdoers.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that you may be successful.
And fear the fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Messenger, that you may obtain mercy.
And vie with forgiveness from your Lord and for a Garden whose width is as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.
Those who spend (benevolently) in prosperity and adversity, and who restrain anger and pardon men; and Allah loves those who do good.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; and who can forgive sins except Allah? and do not knowingly persist in what they have done.
For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever.
Many have passed away before you, so travel through the land and see what was the end of those who rejected the truth.
This is an exposition of the people, and a guidance and a reminder for the pious.
So do not be weak, nor grieve, and you will be superior if you are believers.
If a wound has touched you, then the like of the like of the disbelievers has been struck, and We have made the people go back to the people, so that it may be that Allah may know the believers, and that He may bring you forth from among you, and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test those who believe and make the disbelievers die.
Do you think that you will enter Paradise while God knows not those of you who are steadfast and who are steadfast?
And indeed you did wish for death before you met him, so you have seen it, and you have seen it.
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and there is no Messenger before him. If he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? And whoever turns back on his heels, does not harm Allah. And Allah will reward the thankful.
And it is not for death to die except by the permission of Allah. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him of it; and We shall recompense him with a reward for the thankful.
And many of the prophets have fought with them. They did not weaken in what befell them in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, and Allah loves the patient.
And their saying, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses, and make firm our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter, and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who have believed, if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you on your heels and you will become losers.
Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority. Their abode is the Fire, and evil is the abode of the unjust.
And indeed Allah has promised the promise of your promise, so that you took a covenant with them, and you were killed, and you disputed about the matter, and you disputed about the religion, and you did not differ in the manner of Allah, and He has made you clear. And He has pardoned you, and He has pardoned you. And Allah has pardoned you. And Allah is the Lord of the believers.
When you did not see, and do not wait for any one, and the Messenger will call you from your rear, so He has rewarded you with grief and grief, so that you might not grieve for what you did not have escaped, nor grieve for what befell you. God is aware of what you do.
Then it has made a slip with a calm, which has been sent down to you, and a party of you who came to a party of them, and some of the other, and some of them who were sick, they said, "What is the matter for us?" They said, "What is the matter for us?" They said, "What is the matter for us?" They said, "What is the matter with us?" Say, "What is it that has been given for us?" Say, "It is not for us." Say, "We have been sent down to you." Say, "It is only for us." And Allah knows what is in your hearts. And Allah is Knowing of what you do.
Those of you who turned back on the day of the two hosts, when they met them, Satan made them slip into some manner because of what they had done. And Allah has pardoned them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who have believed, do not be like those who disbelieve and say to their brethren when they travel in the land or fight, "If they had been with us, they would not have died, nor been slain." That Allah may cause him to die, and He will cause life to die. And Allah is Seeing of what you do.
And if you are slain or die in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are better than all that they amass.
And if you die or are killed, then surely Allah will be gathered to you.
So this is a mercy from Allah that you deal with them gently, and had you been rough and hard-hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from around you; so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and ask forgiveness for them; and when you have decided, then put your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, then who can help you after Him? So let the believers put their trust in Allah.
And it is not attributable to a messenger, and whoever defrauds, then he will be requited with what he has earned, and then every soul will be repaid for what it earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who has incurred the wrath of Allah, and his abode is Hell? And the evil destination is the destination.
They are in varying grades, and God sees what they do.
Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from themselves, reciting to them His Signs, and purifying them, and teaching them the Book and Wisdom, although they were in manifest error.
And when a misfortune befell you, if you were afflicted twice, you would say, "What is this?" Say, "What is from you?" Say, "This is from yourselves." Say, "God has power over all things."
And what befell you on the day the two armies met, and that He might test the believers.
And that He may know the hypocrites, and say to them, "Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves." They said: "Had we known that we had been with you, we would certainly have been with you." They are nearer to their mouths. They say, "They are not in their hearts. God knows what they conceal."
They are those who say to their brethren, "If they had stayed in their homes, they would not have been killed." Say, "If you speak the truth, then avert death from death, if you are truthful."
And reckon not those who are slain in the way of Allah as dead; nay, they are alive, and they are provided with their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them, and those who are behind them are those who have not joined them, and they have no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the Grace of Allah and His Bounty, and Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to the call of Allah and the Messenger after the wound has befallen them, and those of them who do good deeds and guard (against evil) shall have a great reward.
Those to whom the people said, "Verily, the people have gathered against you, so fear them, but it only increased them in faith, and they said: Allah is sufficient for us and He is the best Disposer of affairs."
So they returned with grace and grace from Allah; no harm touched them, and they followed the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is the Lord of great grace.
It is only Satan that suggests to you the fear of his supporters, so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And do not grieve those who rush to disbelief, because they do not harm Allah. Allah will not harm them in the Hereafter, and they will have a great punishment.
Those who purchase disbelief in disbelief will not harm Allah, and they will have a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for them. We grant them respite that they may grow in their sins; and they shall have a humiliating punishment.
Allah will not leave the believers in that which you are in, until He gives the good to the good. And Allah will not know that you know the secrets of the Unseen, but Allah chooses of His Messengers whom He pleases. So believe in Allah and His Messengers. And if you believe, then you will have a great reward.
And let not those who are niggardly in what Allah has bestowed on them of His grace think that it is good for them; nay, it is worse for them; nay, it will be worse for them on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is aware of the things you do.
Allah has heard the saying of those who say: 'Allah is poor and we are rich.' They shall say, 'We have been given what they say, and their slaying of the prophets, and we shall say, 'Taste the punishment of the burning.'
That is because of what your hands have sent forth and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say, "Allah has promised us not to believe in a Messenger unless he brings a sacrifice to us." Say: "Messengers have come to you before me, with clear signs and with what you say, if you are truthful."
But if they deny you, then did those who were before you denied the Messengers, the Books of Psalms, the Books of Enlightenment, and the Book of Enlightenment.
Every soul shall taste death, and you shall be recompensed on the Day of Resurrection, and on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever has been removed from the Fire, he will surely have attained a great triumph, and the life of this world is nothing but a delusion.
We will surely be tested in your possessions and your lives, and you will certainly hear from those who were given the Book before the Book and the idolaters. And if you are patient and fear Allah, they will surely be among the righteous.
And (remember) when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book (i.e., the Jews), that you may explain to mankind (the people of) the Book (i.e., the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.), and you did not hide it, but they threw it behind behind their backs, and it was a small price for it, and they took a small price for it.
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done, and do not think that they will not be punished.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah has power over all things.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, there are signs for those who understand.
Those who remember Allah, standing, sitting and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: “Our Lord, You have not created this in vain.
Our Lord! whomsoever Thou dost admit to the Fire, Thou coverest with shame, and never shall the wrong-doers find any helpers.
Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith, saying, "Believe in your Lord, and we will believe. Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us our evil deeds.
Our Lord, give us what You promised us through Your Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. You do not break His promise.
Then their Lord answered to them, "I will not kill you, nor will they kill you. Some of you are one of some of you, and some of you." They will be in the homes of their homes, and they will live in their homes, and they will have fought with their homes, and they will live in the midst of their homes. That is the reward of Allah. And He will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the reward of Allah.
Do not let the disbelievers deceive you in the land.
A brief enjoyment; then their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.
But for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever; and that which is with Allah is better for the righteous, and that which is with Allah is better for the righteous.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and that which has been revealed to you, and that which has been sent down to them, and that which has been sent down to them, and they do not sell the communications of Allah for a small price. Those are the reward of their Lord; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who have believed, persevere and endure and remain stationed and fear Allah that you may be successful.
O mankind, fear your Lord who created you from a single soul and created from it its mate, and from the pair of many men and women, and fear God and women. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is over you over you.
And give the orphans their wealth, and do not exchange the good things for the good, and do not consume their wealth; for this is a great sin.
And if you fear that you will not be established in justice until you marry one of the wives and the women, and if you fear that you will not be able to do so. If you fear that you will not be able to do justice, or your hands, or your hands, and that it may be that you do not do so.
And give women their dowries as a free gift; but if they give you a part of it, then give it to you with it and enjoy it.
And do not let those who do not have the property of your wealth give you a benefit for them, and provide them to give it to them and speak to them with kindness and speak to them with good words.
And give the orphans orphans's age until they reach the age of age. So if you give them their property, give them their wealth, and do not consume the fear of a great fear. And if you give a share, it is only for them. And if you give a share, then bear witness against them. And if you give them their wealth, you bear witness against them; and Allah is Sufficient as Reckoner.
To those who are near to the parents and near relatives, and for the relatives, and the women, and the women, or a portion of their wives, or a small portion, or a small portion.
And when the relatives and the orphans and the orphans and the needy are present, give them something of them, and speak to them honourable words.
And those who fear that they should be afraid of their offspring, if they should fear them, so let them fear Allah, and speak what is right.
Those who consume the property of the orphans in their bellies will burn in their bellies, and they will roast in the fire.
Allah has enjoined to marry you to the sons of the sons of the sons of Israel. And if he is a wife, he is two wives, and if he is two, they are two sons, and if he is a two being, he is one of them, and if he is one of the two sons, he will be one of them. And if he is a son, he will be one of those who are near. And if he does not take a son, he will have a share of it. And if he does not take a son, he will have a share of it.
And the wives of your wives will come to you and if they have a son, if a son is a son, then if a son had a son, it would be lawful for you, and if a son had a son, it would be lawful for you, and if you had a son, it would be for a female. And if a child had a son, he would not be able to give you a child. If a child or a child, it will be a little for them. And if you have a son, it will be a little for them. And if a child or a child, then they will be a slave. And if a child or a child, then they will be a slave.
These are the limits of Allah; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the great success.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will admit him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he will have a humiliating punishment.
And if any of your women are guilty of lewdness, call four witnesses from among you against them; if they testify, confine them to houses until death overtakes them until death overtakes them, or Allah opens a way for them.
And if two of you commit indecency, punish them; but if they repent and amend, turn aside from them; surely Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.
Allah accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent after that, and then repent afterwards; for Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.
And repentance is not for those who do evil deeds until death approaches one of them and he says, "I repent," nor for those who die while they die. We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
O you who have believed, do not let your wives go to inherit women, nor do they give you a clear authority, but you have to take away what you have given them, and release them with an honourable love. And if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike it.
And if you desire to take a wife to another wife, and if you have a share of a wealth, then do not bring it back to it. Would you take it against him and manifest a manifest sin?
And how can you take it for another, and have taken a covenant from you, and take it from you?
And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what is past; indeed, it is an indecency and an evil way.
It is all that you have, and what you have taken from Him, and that which you have created, and that which you worship, and that which you worship, and that which your mother has made, and that you are your mothers, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your mothers. And if you do not come to them, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And women, except for women, are not lawful. It is Allah's decree which is ordained by you, and that which is lawful for you, and that which is lawful for you. And if you do not find the wealth of your wealth, then give them a share of your wealth, and give women a share of what you have acquired, and then you will not be able to find any fault in it. God is All-knowing, All-wise.
And (as for) believing women, who are believing in believing women, not believing women, and believing women, and Allah knows best what you are of those who are of you. And Allah is well-pleased with all of you, and give them a share of their wives, and give them wives and women, as if they are a slave. And if they die, then surely they will be a slave of them. And you shall be rewarded. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah wishes to make clear to you, and to guide you towards the ways of those before you, and to turn towards you; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And Allah desires to turn towards you, but those who follow their lusts wish that you should be far away from a great deviation.
God wants to lighten for you, and man was created weak.
O you who have believed, do not consume yourselves in the property of one another, but eat of it, but do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whoever does this aggressively and unjustly, We shall soon cast him into Hell; and that is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the sin of sin, you will certainly be forgiven your sins, and We will admit you into a noble paradise.
Do not covet what Allah has made for you as much of others; men shall have a share of what they have earned, and women shall have a share of what they earn. And seek Allah's grace for His grace; surely Allah knows all things.
And We have made heirs for all of the parents and the relatives and all that We have made with you, and give them their share; surely Allah is Witness over all things.
The women of women are because of what Allah has made some of them than others, and that which they spend, and that they may spend their wealth, and that they may guard with good women, and keep the good-doers, and guard them with the fear of Allah. And if they obey you, admonish them. And if they obey you, do not make them go astray. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Great.
And if ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint a man from his family and from his family; if they wish for peace, Allah will cause them to grow into their midst; surely Allah is Knowing, Aware.
And worship Allah, and do not associate anything with Him, and to parents, orphans, orphans, orphans, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the companion, the companion, and the wayfarer.
Those who are niggardly, and are niggardly, and hide what Allah has given them of His bounty, and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who spend out of their substance in order to see the people, and who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and whoever takes Satan, it is an evil companion.
And how would it be that if they believe in Allah and the Last Day, and spend out of what Allah has provided them? And Allah knows them.
Allah does not wrong the weight of an atom, and if there is a good deed, He will double it, and He will give him a great reward.
How will it be when We bring forth from every nation a witness, and We bring you as a witness against them?
On that day, those who disbelieve and disobey the Messenger will wish that the earth will be leveled with them, and they will not be able to hide from Allah a single thing.
O you who believe! Do not be near to prayer until you come to the prayer, but when you know what you say, do not know what you say, and when you are sick, or if you are sick, or if you are sick, or if you are sick, or if you are sick, or if you are sick, or if you are sick, then do not give water to your wives; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, so that they may go astray, and that you may go astray from the way?
And Allah knows best your enemies; and Allah is Sufficient as a guardian, and Allah suffices as a helper.
And the Jews, who have been left away from their backs, and what they say, and to the ignorant, and to the ignorant, and to those who ask of it. They say, "It is better for them." They say, "It is better for them," but they say, "It is better for them."
O People of the Book! Believe in what We have sent down with you, confirming what is with you, and turn them on the backs of their faces, or curse them as We cursed them; and the command of Allah is the command of the Sabbath.
Surely Allah forgives not that partners should be associated with Him, but He forgives anything else to whomsoever He pleases.
Have you not seen those who ascribe purity to Him? Nay, but Allah will love whomsoever He pleases, and they will not be dealt with unjustly.
See how they invent lies against Allah, and that is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who have been given the Book, who believe in superstition and false deities, and say, "These are better guided than the believers?"
Those are those whom Allah has cursed, and whomsoever Allah curses, you will not find for him a helper.
Or do they have a share of the kingdom, so that they may not be able to do the least?
Or do they envy men because of what Allah has bestowed upon them from His bounty? We gave the Book and the Wisdom to the Children of Abraham, and We gave them a great kingdom.
And among them are some who believe in the Book, and of them are some of them who turn away from him. And sufficient is Hell.
As for those who reject Our communications, We shall soon cast into the Fire; as often as their skins are roasted, We shall change them for fresh skins; for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.
As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. They will be pure spouses, and We shall admit them into gardens of pure shade.
Verily, Allah commands you to give to the owners of the covenant, and when you judge between people, judge with justice; surely Allah is better for you. Lo! Allah is Hearing, Seeing.
O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those among you who are given authority. If you dispute about anything, refer to Allah and the Last Day, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day, so that better is better and better.
Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and they wish to have been ordered to judge against them, and they have been ordered to disbelieve in them. Satan wants to lead them astray.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites turn away from you.
How then, when evil befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, then they come to you swearing by Allah, and they will not come to you except for good and conciliation.
Those are the ones who know what is in their hearts; so turn away from them, and admonish them, and speak to them a word with their souls.
“We did not send any messenger but that he should be obeyed by Allah's permission; and when they had been unjust to themselves, they had come to you and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would surely have found Allah’s mercy and mercy.”
“But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they make you (O Muhammad SAW) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”
And if We had decreed for them, "Kill yourselves or your homes," but they would not have done it except a few of them, but if they had done what they were admonished, it would have been better for them, and most surely they would have believed.
And We gave them a great reward from Us.
And We guided them on a straight path.
And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), those are with them with Allah, the Prophets, the Truthful, the Truthful, the martyrs, the Righteous, and the righteous are the best.
This is from Allah, and Allah is aware of it.
O you who have believed, take your precaution, and go forth in companies and go forth in companies.
And among you is he who lingers behind; but if a misfortune befalls you, he will say, "Allah has blessed me that I am not present with them."
And if a favour from Allah comes to you, he would say, as if there had been no friendship between you and him, that if I had been with them, I would certainly have achieved a great success.
So let them who sell the life of this world to fight for the life of the Hereafter, and whoever fights in the way of Allah, or is killed, We shall give him a great reward, or a great reward.
And what reason have you that you should not fight in the way of Allah and of the weak among men and women and children and children who say: Our Lord! take us out of this town, whose people are oppressors, and give us from Thee a helper.
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Satan. So fight the friends of Satan, for the devil is not in the cunning of Satan.
Have you not seen those who were told to be said to their own hands, "As for the prayer, and the prayer, and the poor-rate, and then, when the fighting was fighting, a party of them feared a few of them, fearing the fear of God?" They said, "Our Lord, if you are afraid of them." Say, "Our Lord, you are the best of us." Say, "The life of this world is a good thing."
Wherever you are, death will overtake you, and if you are in towers, they say, "This is from God." But if good befalls them, they say, "This is from God." Say, "This is from you." Say, "All things are from God." And what is the matter with the people?
Whatever good befalls you, it is from Allah; and whatever evil befalls you, it is from your soul; and We have sent you as a messenger to mankind; and Allah suffices as a witness.
Whoever obeys the Messenger, obeys Allah; and whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a keeper over them.
And they say: "When you have come to them, then a party of them decide by night by night, and some of them swear by the night by night. And if they decide, Allah will judge between them and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is sufficient as a guardian."
Do they not consider the Qur'an? Had it been from Allah, they would have found in it many contradiction.
And when they know it or fear them, they make it clear to them; but if they send a messenger and those of them who have been given the Messenger, those among them who know it will know it. And if it were not for the grace of Allah and His mercy, you would have followed a few of them.
So fight in the way of Allah, for you are not responsible for yourself, and rouse the believers; maybe that Allah may restrain the fighting of the unbelievers; and Allah will punish the disbelievers, and Allah is Strong, Severe in punishment.
Whoever intercedes with a good deed will have a share of it, and whoever intercedes for it will have a share of it. And Allah is over all things.
And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet it with a better greeting or return to it; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
God, there is no god but He. He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. And who is more truthful than God?
What is the matter with you that you are two groups of the hypocrites, while Allah has made them for their deeds, so that you may guide him whom Allah has sent astray? And whomsoever Allah leads astray, you will not find a way for him.
They desire that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, so do not be equal to them. Do not take friends for them until they emigrate in the way of Allah; but if they turn back, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. Do not take a friend or helper.
Except for those who have come to you, and those who have come to you, and those who have come to you, or those who have come to you, or their hearts, or their people. Had Allah willed, He would have given them power over you. Had Allah willed, He would have given them power over you, and then you will be saved. And Allah will not cause you to go astray.
You will find a people who wish to be safe from you, and they desire to be safe from their people, and they will be in the midst of the wicked. If you do not turn away from them, and do not leave your hands, and do not leave your hands, then take them out of their hands and kill them wherever you find them. And We have given you a clear authority.
And there will not be for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) in the life of the believers (i.e. the believers). And whosoever believes in Allah and His Mercy, then verily, he who believes (in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad SAW), and is forgiven, (for him), verily, there is forgiveness from his Lord; and if he is a party of your family, he should be forgiven for the believers, and if he is a party of your family, then surely he is a slave of the believers. And if there be a party of the people of the family of the believers, he will surely be forgiven.
“And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, abiding therein forever, and Allah will curse him and curse him and prepare for him a painful punishment.”
O you who believe! When you go to fight in the way of Allah, investigate, and do not say to those who do not say, "You are not a believer." And the life of this world is not for the goods of this world; indeed, there are many of them in the presence of Allah; surely Allah has bestowed favor on you. So do not give alms. God is aware of what you do.
Those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) are not equal to those who believe, and strive hard in the way of Allah and their lives in the way of Allah with their wealth and their lives. And those who strive with their wealth and their lives are better in the cause of Allah. And Allah has promised all that is good, and Allah has preferred the reward of the believers.
There is forgiveness from Him, and mercy and mercy. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who have wronged themselves will say to their souls, "What did you think?" They will say, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say: "Was not the earth and the earth?" They will say: "Was not Allah's earth spacious?"
The men and the women and the women and the children of Israel will not find any way, nor can they find any way to guide.
Allah will forgive them, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And whoever emigrates in the way of Allah will find in the earth many locations and plenty, and whoever goes forth from his home, and death and death overtakes him, his reward is with Allah; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And when you travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve may afflict you; surely the unbelievers are open to you.
And when they pray, they pray for a group of them, and there is a group of them with whom they will find war. And when they bow down, they will follow you, and they will come after you. And when they stand down, they will follow you, and they will find a covenant with them. And if they are not a <unk>, they will take it away from you. And if you are ill, then you will not be able to change it.
When you pray, remember Allah, and sitting, and sitting on your sides, and when you are secure, establish prayer, and establish prayer. The prayer is for the believers.
And do not be weak in pursuit of the enemy. If you are suffering, they are suffering as you are suffering; and you hope for God's hope; and God is All-knowing, All-wise.
We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, so that you may judge between the people, that you may judge between the people, and do not be deceived.
And seek forgiveness from Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do not be deceived; God does not love those who are deceived.
They do not hide from the people, and they do not hide from Allah, but they do not hide their faces by night, and God encompasses what they do.
Verily, you are a people who argue about the life of this world, but who will argue with Allah on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be their guardian?
And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whoever commits a sin, then surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And whoever commits a fault or a sin, then then he is innocent of the burden of sin and a manifest sin.
And had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, a party of them would have led you astray, and they would not mislead you, and they will not harm you, and they will not harm you, and Allah has sent down to you the Book and wisdom, and He has taught you what you did not know.
There is no good in their secret in secret, except for what is good or good or conciliation between people. And whoever does this, We shall give him a great reward, and We shall give him a great reward.
And whoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the way of the believers, We shall leave him in the way he has chosen, and burn him in Hell, and what an evil destination!
Allah forgives not that partners should be associated with Him, but He forgives whomsoever He pleases. And whoever sets up partners with Allah, he has indeed strayed far astray.
They invoke none but Him besides Him, and they invoke none but Satan.
God has cursed him, and he said, "I have a portion of Your servants."
And I will lead them astray, and I will fill them in vain, and I will order them, and I will give them the ears of the cattle, and I will change them, and I will change the creation of Allah, and whoever takes Satan for a friend, surely he is a manifest loss.
Satan promises them to deceive them and let them deceive them. Satan is not only a delusion.
Their abode will be hell, and they will not find any way of escape from it.
And those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the promise of Allah, and who is more truthful than God?
It is not your desires nor the desires of the People of the Book. Whoever does evil will be requited for it. And besides Allah will they find no protector or helper.
And whoever does good deeds, whether male or female, will enter Paradise and will not be dealt with a single injustice, and they will not be wronged in the least.
And who is better in religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah and does good, and follows the religion of Abraham, the monotheist?
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth; and Allah encompasses all things.
They ask you concerning the women. Say, "Allah will show you what you have been commanded, and what they recite to you in the Book, and that which they do not do what they do not do.
And if a woman fears ill or ill-usage or desertion on his husband, there is no blame on them if they make reconciliation between each other, and reconciliation is better for themselves; and if you do good, then surely Allah is aware of what you do.
And you will not be able to be able to be in a relationship between women and women, so do not be stingy, but do not incline away from them; but if you do so, then surely Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And if they separate, Allah will enrich them in abundance, and Allah is All-Embracing, All-Wise.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And We have enjoined on those who were before the Book and those who were before the Book. And if you disbelieve, then whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth belongs to Allah; and Allah is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and Allah suffices as a guardian.
O mankind, if Allah wills, He will cause you to take it, and He will bring you forth. God has power over all things.
Whoever desires the reward of this world, then with Allah is the reward of this world and the Hereafter; and Allah is Hearing, Seeing.
O you who have believed, be steadfast in justice, witnesses against Allah, even though it be to your parents or to the parents or the needy. If he is a man or a poor or poor or poor, Allah will be the most merciful of them. So do not follow the desires of the righteous. God is aware of what you do.
O you who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book which He has sent down to His Messenger and the Book which He has sent down aforetime, and whoever disbelieves in Allah and His Angels and His Books and the Last Day and the Last Day and the Last Day, indeed, it is far better for him.
Those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe, then disbelieve, and increase in disbelief, Allah will not forgive them nor guide them on the way.
Give glad tidings to the hypocrites that they shall have a painful punishment.
Those who take the unbelievers for friends instead of the believers. Do they seek to seek them? Glory be to Allah!
And Allah has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the signs of Allah, and mocked them, and do not sit with them until they enter some other discourse. If you are like them, you will be like them; surely Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers.
Those who wait for you. If victory comes from you, they say, "Were we not with you," they say, "Were we not with you?" But if a portion of those who disbelieve say to those who disbelieve, they will not help you. God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. God will judge between the unbelievers.
Indeed, the hypocrites are averse to Allah. And Allah will raise them astray, and when they stand up, they stand at it, but they stand up, but they do not remember God, but they do not remember.
They are not a people, nor a nation. And whomsoever Allah leads astray, you will not find a way for him.
O you who have believed, do not take the disbelievers for friends instead of the believers. Do you desire to be a manifest proof against God?
The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire, and you will not find for them a helper.
Except those who repent and keep fast to Allah, and keep fast to Allah, and those who believe, and those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism), and Allah is the greatest of believers.
Why should Allah punish you if you are grateful and believe? And Allah is All-Appreciative, All-Knowing.
God does not love the evil of the wicked, but God is Hearing, Knowing.
If you do good openly or conceal it, or pardon an evil, surely Allah is Pardoning, Powerful.
Those who believe not in Allah and His Messengers and wish to make a distinction between Allah and His apostles, and say: We believe not in the Messengers and believe in it.
Such are those who disbelieve, and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them, We will soon give them their rewards; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The People of the Book ask you to bring down to them a Book from heaven; but they said, "Show us Allah," and they said, "Show us what Allah has revealed to us." So they took a calf for them, so that they took a calf for them, so that they may take a calf after them. And We gave Moses a clear authority.
And We raised the Mount over them, and We said to them, "Enter the gate," and We said, "Enter the gate," and We said to them, "Do not transgress the Sabbath, and We have made a covenant with them."
So, because of their breaking their covenant, and of the signs of Allah, and of the prophets, and of the prophets, and of the prophets, saying: Our hearts are covered by their hearts; nay, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not.
And because of their disbelief, and because of their disbelief, they lied against them.
That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:-
Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
And there is none of the People of the Book but will believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.
Then, for the wrong-doers, We forbade them of the good things that were lawful for them, and made them of the way of the people of the law, and of the way of the people of the people of Israel.
And for their taking usury, though they had been forbidden from it, and of the people of the people wrongfully, and We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
And among them are those who believe and believe in what has been revealed to you, and what has been revealed to you, and what was sent down before you, and the prayer, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and believe in Allah and the Last Day.
We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him, and We revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Aaron, and We gave David the Psalms.
And Messengers We have mentioned to you before, and Messengers We have not mentioned to you, and God spoke to Moses.
Messengers of good news and warners, so that they may not have any plea against the messengers after the coming of the apostles. And Allah is Mighty, Wise.
“But Allah bears witness that He has sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) that He has sent down (the Qur'an) with knowledge, and the angels (angels) bear witness, and Allah suffices as a witness.”
Verily, those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah (i.e. Islam), indeed, they are in a far error.
Those who disbelieve and do wrong, Allah will not forgive them nor guide them to a way.
Except for the way of hell, to abide therein, and that is easy for Allah.
O mankind, the Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe in it. And if you disbelieve, then surely whoever is in the heavens and the earth. To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
O People of the Book! Do not exaggerate in your religion, and say, "I am the Messiah, the son of Mary, the son of Mary, the son of Mary, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah, and His command. So believe in Allah and His Messengers. So believe in Allah and His Messengers. So believe in Allah and His Messengers. And whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth, it is He who is the Lord of the worlds.
The Messiah does not disdain to be a servant of God, nor will the angels, nor the angels, and the angels, and those who worship Him, and He will gather them all together.
But as for those who believe and do good deeds, He will give them their rewards in full, and He will give them more out of His grace; and those who disdain and wax proud, will suffer a painful punishment.
O mankind, there has come to you a proof from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.
And those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into His mercy and His grace, and He guides them to the Straight Path.
They ask you about the children of the Prophet, and say: "Allah, if you are not a child, He will give you the benefit of your wives." Say, "He is the son of Joseph." And if they die, he will not be able to give birth to his wife. And if they die, they will be able to take care of their wives. And if they are, they will have two wives. And if they are pregnant, they will have two wives. And if they are, they will have two wives. And Allah has knowledge of all things.
O you who believe! Fulfill the covenant which you have made, and the cattle is not lawful for you, except for the sake of Allah, and that you may be a stranger. Surely Allah does what He pleases.
O you who believe! Do not make the communications of Allah, the Lord of the Universe, and not a <unk>, nor a <unk>, nor a <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>.
It is lawful for you to die, and the blood of the flesh, and the flesh, and the flesh, and the flesh, and that which is named by the name of the other, and that which is the name of the Lord, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and the animals, and all that is in the flesh; and if they die, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
They ask you of the things that are lawful for them, say: "It is lawful for you." Say, "It is lawful for you, and that which is lawful to you, and that it may be lawful for you, so that you may be taught by what Allah has taught you, and that which He has taught you, so that you may fear Allah. Allah is swift in reckoning."
Today you have provided for you a good and pure food; and the Book is lawful for you, and that which is lawful for you, and that which is good for them. And those who have been given the Book and those who have been given the Book of the Book shall not be lost, and those who have been given a portion of the Book shall be lost, and he will be of the losers.
O you who believe! When you call your faces, your faces, and your souls, and your hands, and your souls, and to them in order that you may be cut off; and if you keep a pledge, then it may be that you are free. And if you are ill or keep off from it, it may be that you are free from it. And if you are ill, or keep it away from you, or keep it from your own hands. And if you are ill, then you are free.
And remember Allah's favour upon you and His covenant which He made with you, when you said, "We hear and we obey"; and fear Allah. Surely Allah knows what is in the breasts.
O you who have believed, bear witness to the testimony of Allah and be steadfast in justice. And let not the people of the people go to you in order to do justice. So fear Allah, and fear Allah. Surely Allah is aware of what you do.
Allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds that theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our Signs, they are the companions of the Fire.
O you who believe! Remember Allah's favor upon you when a people were able to stretch your hands on you, and He restrained their hands from you, and fear Allah. And Allah is Ever in order to believe.
And We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and raised them up from among them; and Allah said: Lo! I am with you; but if ye establish prayer and pay the prayer, and believe in My apostles and help them and help them and help them, and lend them a goodly loan, and if ye are in Gardens of Eden, I will surely acquit you of that which rivers flow; and thereafter shall I admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow.
So because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts hard; they change their words, and they have been reminded of what they were reminded of. So pardon them and overlook them. So pardon them, and overlook them; surely Allah loves those who do good.
And We made a covenant with those who say, "We are Christians," but they forgot what was reminded of them. So We stirred enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will inform them of what they did.
O People of the Book, there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much of that which you used to hide from the Book and passing over much.
Allah guides those who follow His pleasure to the ways of peace and brings them out of darkness into light by His permission, and guides them to a straight path.
Surely, they have disbelieved who say, "Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary." Say, "Who is the Messiah, the son of Mary, and his mother, and his mother, and all those who are on earth?" And the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. God creates what He pleases and what is between them. And Allah has power over all things.
The Jews and the Christians say, "We are the sons of God and His beloved ones." Say, "Why then does He punish you for your sins?" But He forgives whom He pleases and forgives whom He pleases. And He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. To Him belongs the return.
O People of the Book, there has come to you Our Messenger, making clear to you the Messengers, lest you should say, "There came to us no bringer of good news and a warner." But there has come to you a good news and a warner. And Allah has power over all things.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, remember Allah's favor upon you when He produced prophets among you, made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the peoples."
O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you, and turn not back ignominiously, lest you become losers.
They said, "O Moses, indeed there is a great nation in it, and we will never enter it until they leave it. If they go away from it, we will enter it."
And two men of the two men who feared God said, "Assault them," and they said, "Enter them," and when you are in it, you will be victorious; and trust in God, if you are believers.
They said, "O Moses, we will never enter it until they are therein, and you will be your Lord, and you will fight and fight."
He said, "My Lord, I have no power over myself and my brother, so judge between us and the wicked people."
He said, "It has been forbidden for forty years. They wander in the land. Do not grieve in the land, so do not grieve."
And recite to them the story of the two sons of Adam, when they offered a sacrifice to each other, and it was accepted from them, and it was accepted from them, "I will surely kill you." He said, "I will surely kill you."
If you stretch your hand to kill me, I will not stretch my hand on you to slay you; surely I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
I desire that you should bear my sin and your sin, and you will be among the inmates of the Fire, and that is the recompense of the wrongdoers.
Then he killed his brother to kill him, and he killed him, and he became one of the losers.
Then God sent down a raven, that He might show him how he was able to hide his brother's corpse, and he said, "Alas for me! I am like a raven like that which I am carrying to my brother." So he became one of the losers.
Thus We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a person as manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and as it was as if he had saved the life of all mankind; and if he had saved it, it would be as if he had saved the life of all mankind. And indeed, many of them were transgressors.
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.
Except for those who repent before you overpower them. Know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek the means of nearness to Him and strive in His way that you may prosper.
As for those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth and the like of the like of it, it would be accepted from them from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and theirs will be a painful punishment.
They will wish to go out of the Fire, and they will not be brought forth therefrom, and theirs will be a lasting torment.
As for the thief, the male or female, and the women of the male, as a punishment from Allah; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
But whoever repents after his crime and does good deeds, Allah will turn towards him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He pleases and forgives whom He pleases. And Allah has power over all things.
O Prophet! Do not grieve those who disbelieve, because they say to their mouths, "We believe in their mouths," and they say, "We believe," and their hearts do not have their faith. And those who are Jews and Christians do not come to you with a lie. They have not come to you with a lie. They say, "If you are commanded, you will be saved."
They listen to falsehood, but if they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. And if you turn away, they will not hurt you in the least. And if you judge them, judge between them with equity. God loves those who do good.
And how can they judge thee, when they have been given the Torah? In that case, they are in the presence of Allah, after they turn away, and they are not believers.
We have sent down the Torah, wherein is guidance and light; and the prophets and the rabbis and the rabbis and the Jews, who were commanded to observe the Book of God, and were witnesses against them. So do not fear the people, and have witnesses against them. Do not fear Me, and do not exchange My revelations for a small price.
And We decreed for them in the Book, the life of the eye, the nose, the nose, the nose, the nose, the tooth, for the tooth, and the tooth; and whoever remits the wounds, it shall be expiation for him; and whoever does not judge by what Allah has sent down, it shall be for him.
And We sent in their footsteps Jesus, son of Mary, confirming that which was before him of the Torah, and We gave him the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the light, and the Torah, and the Torah, and a guidance and a reminder for the righteous.
And the followers of the Book will judge according to what God has sent down, and those who do not judge according to what God has revealed.
And We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming the Book which is before them, and that which has been sent down from the Book, and that which Allah has revealed to you. So follow what has been revealed to you, and do not follow their desires. And do not follow the desires of those who have come to the truth, and do not follow their desires. And if Allah had willed, He would have made you all.
And judge between them by what Allah has sent down, and follow not their desires, and beware of them lest they seduce you from some of what Allah has revealed to you. But if they turn away, know that Allah will punish them for their sins. And most of mankind are transgressors.
What do they desire to do, and who is better than the people who believe in God?
O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever among you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease hastening towards them, saying, "We fear lest a misfortune befall us." So, God will bring them a victory, or a new command from Him, so that they may be remorseful.
And those who believe will say, "Are these the ones who swore by Allah that they are with you?" They will have their deeds, and they will be losers.
O you who have believed, whoever of you turns away from his religion, Allah will surely bring forth a people who will love Him and humble themselves to Him, who will strive against the believers, and they will strive hard in the way of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic. Such is the bounty of Allah; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
Your guardian is only Allah and His Apostle and those who believe, and those who establish regular prayers and pay the poor-rate.
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and those who believe, then surely the party of Allah will be the victors.
O you who have believed, do not take for those who have been given the Book and those who were before you as a joke and a joke for those who have been given the Book and the disbelievers, and fear Allah if you are believers.
And when you call to prayer, they take it as mockery and sport; this is because they are a people who do not understand.
Say: "O People of the Book! do you disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was sent down before, and that most of you are transgressors?"
Say, "Shall I inform you of something worse than that which I possess? Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed, and the curse of those whom He has cursed, and some of whom He has made apes and swine. They are worse than the evil-doers.
When they come to you, they say, "We believe," but they have come to disbelief, and they go forth with it; and Allah knows best what they hide.
And you see many of them hastening away, and the devouring of the forbidden and the devouring, and evil is what they do.
Do they not forbid the rabbis and the rabbis and the women of their own selves? Evil is what they do.
And the Jews say: "Allah's plan is in the hand of Allah." They say: "Nay, they are cursed by what they say, and they are not proud of what they say; nay, it is in the hands of Allah that He may make it known to you. And that which He pleases, and that which He pleases, and that which is in the earth. And We make enmity between them and those who do mischief in the land. And Allah loveth not those who make mischief.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would certainly have removed from them their sins and admitted them to gardens of bliss.
And if they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and what has been sent down to them from their Lord, they would have been provided from above them and from beneath their feet. Some of them are a people who have gone astray.
O Messenger! deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord; and if you do it not, then you have not delivered His message, and Allah will protect you from the people; and Allah will not guide the unbelieving people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book (Jews and Christians), ye shall not stand on the ground until ye stand up until the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord will increase many of them in inordinacy and disbelief. So do not grieve for the disbelievers.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.
We made a covenant with the Children of Israel and We sent messengers to them. When there came to them a messenger with what they did not desire, some of them they denied, and some they killed.
And they thought that there is no trial, so they became deaf and deaf; then Allah has shown them mercy, so that many of them are deaf and deaf. And Allah sees what they do.
Those who disbelieve say, "The Messiah, son of Mary, is God's son." And the Messiah said, "O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." But whoever associates with Allah, He will admit him into the garden, and his abode will be the fire; and the unjust will be a helper.
Those who say, "Allah is the third of three." There is no god but He. And if they do not desist from what they say, the disbelievers will not desist from the painful torment.
Will they not then turn to Allah and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. There were many messengers before him, and his mother was one of the truth. And his mother ate food. See how We make clear to them the signs; so see how they are turned away.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which can neither profit you nor benefit you? Allah is Hearing, Knowing."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O people of the Book (Jews and Christians), do not exaggerate in your religion in the religion of truth, nor follow the desires of the people who went astray before, and many misled many and misled many of the way."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses.
They did not forbid one another from what they used to do. Evil is what they used to do.
You see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which their souls have sent before them, and that God's wrath is that which they have been, and they will abide in the punishment of eternal punishment.
And if they believed in Allah and the Prophet and what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them for friends, but most of them are transgressors.
You will surely find the most hostile of the Jews and the idolaters in the sight of the believers, and you will see those who say, "We are Christians," and those who say, "We are Christians".
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the truth; they say: Our Lord! we believe, so write us down among the witnesses.
And what aileth us that we should not believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, and that our Lord will admit us to the company of the righteous?
So Allah has prepared for them that which they say, with gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever; and this is the reward of the righteous.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our Signs, they are the companions of the Fire.
O you who believe! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress limits; surely Allah loves not transgressors.
And eat of that which Allah has provided for you, lawful and good, and fear Allah in Whom you are believers.
Allah will not force you to account for the oaths that you will not seize your oaths, and if you do not swear, then you will not be able to kill the souls of your souls, and that you may eat the souls of the souls of the souls of the people, or if you are poor.
O you who believe! intoxicants and gambling, and idols and divining arrows are an abomination of Satan. So avoid that which you may prosper.
Satan wants to excite enmity and hatred between you and intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and prayer. Will you not then abstain?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and fear Him. If you turn away, know that Our duty is only to convey the duty of Our Messenger.
Those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, there is no sin on what they eat, and they believe, and believe, and do righteous deeds, and they fear God and believe in Him, and believe in Him; and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! Allah will test you through what you have earned or your lances, and that Allah may test those who fear Him, and whoever turns away after that, there is a painful punishment for him.
O you who believe! Do not be thankful for the sake of the people of the world. And whoever among you dies, then surely he dies, and he who dies, then He gives you a double of what he has given you. It is not lawful for you to die, or the poor, or the poor, or those who do not believe in the cause of Allah. That is the recompense of those who do evil deeds. And Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
It is lawful for you to eat of the sea, and to eat for you, and to provide for you a provision and a provision; and the land is forbidden for you. And fear Allah and be wary of Him.
God has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, the Sacred Month, and the Month and the Month, that you may know that you know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth; and Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment and that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message, and Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The good and the bad are not equal, even though the abundance of the bad may attract you. So fear Allah, so that you may be successful."
O you who have believed, do not ask about things which has been made clear to you, if it is clear to you, and if you ask about them, they will be made manifest to you. God has pardoned you. God is Forgiving and Forbearing.
A people before you asked about it, and they disbelieved in it.
God has not made any Bahirah, nor Wasilah, nor Wasilah, nor Hami, but they deny the lie of God, and most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," they say, "Sufficient for us is that which we found our fathers doing." Even even though their fathers knew not, nor were they guided.
O you who believe! Be careful to your souls. If you are guided, no harm can hurt you. To Allah you will be returned to all that you did. He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who believe! If death approaches one of you, then two two months are two; but if they are in the land, they will be among you, or other than you. And when you are dead, then surely you will be able to stand in the land, and if you have a doubt, then if you have no doubt, then let them swear by the name of Allah, and they will swear allegiance to Allah. And We will surely tell you the interpretation of the truth.
But if they know that they are guilty of sin, then two men have two nearest to one another, and they swear by Allah, that they may bear witness to the testimony of their testimony, and that they should not have been slain, and we have not transgressed.
It may be that it may be better for them, or fear their oaths after their oaths. And fear Allah, and listen to him. And Allah does not guide the disobedient people.
On the Day when Allah will gather all the messengers together, and will say: What is what you have been given? They will say: We have no knowledge. You are the Knower of all things.
And when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, "My Lord, remember Me, and my mother, and all that I have bestowed upon you, and the Holy Spirit, which I have bestowed upon you, and the people who are in the Book, and that which is in the Book of God, and that which is in the midst of the Book and the Gospel."
And when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said, "We believe and bear witness that we are Muslims."
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, will your Lord send down to us a table from heaven?" He said, "Fear God, if you are believers."
They said, "We wish that we may eat from it, and that our hearts may know that you are truthful."
“Jesus, son of Mary, said, ‘O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven, to be a festival for us and the last of us and the last of us and a sign from You.
He said, "I will send it down to you, but whoever of you disbelieves in me, I will punish him with a severe punishment."
And when Allah will say, "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take my mother and my mother?' He will say, "You are the glory of God." He will say, "You say, 'You are not truthful.'
"Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say: worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord."
If You punish them, they are Your servants; and if You forgive them, indeed You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say: "This is a day on which the truthful will profit their truthfulness, for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him. That is the great success."
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and He has power over all things.
All praise belongs to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the light light and light; then those who disbelieve ascribe equals to their Lord.
He it is Who created you from clay, then decreed a term, and a term (of a term); then there is a term in which you doubt.
And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal; and He knows what you earn.
There is no sign from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
They denied the truth when it came to them, but they will come to them.
Have they not seen how many a generation We have destroyed before them, and We established on the earth, that We had not established you, and We caused them to grow on the sky, beneath which rivers flow, and We caused them to grow in the rivers, and We have made them a generation of their sins, and after them We have created the nations of the earth?
And if We had sent down to you a Book on paper, and they had touched it with their hands, those who disbelieved would say: This is nothing but obvious magic.
And they say, "Why has not an angel been sent down to him?" Had We sent down the angels, it would have been decreed for them, but they would not be respited.
And if We had made him an angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would have made them doubt concerning what they have been confused.
Messengers have been derided before thee, but those who scoffed surrounded them, that they scoffed at them.
Say: Travel in the land and see how was the end of the deniers.
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the Day of Resurrection. He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection concerning the Day of Resurrection.
And to Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Say, "Shall I take for myself a guardian other than Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth? He feeds and gives no provision. Say: "I am commanded to be the first of those who submit to Him, and He will not be of the idolaters."
Say, "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous Day."
On that Day, whoever is averted from it, Allah has indeed shown mercy to him, and that is the manifest triumph.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, none can remove it but He; and if He touches you with good, He has power over all things.
And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Ask them, "What is the greater testimony?" Say, "I testify that God is witness to me and you, and I testify that the Qur'an has been revealed to you." It is revealed that it is revealed to you, and to those who warn the truth, and to warn those who are near to the truth. Do you think that there is no god but Allah? Say, "I am only a god."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own sons. Those who do not believe will not believe.
Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers do not prosper.
And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, "Where are your partners whom you used to assert?"
Then there shall be no excuse for them except that they say: By our Lord, we were not idolaters.
See how they lied against themselves, and that which they used to invent.
And among them are those who listen to thee, and We have put veils on their hearts, lest they understand it, and deafness in their ears; but if they see every sign, they will not believe in it. When they come to thee, they say: This is nothing but tales of the ancients.
And they forbid it, and they turn away from it, and they do not destroy themselves, but they do not know.
And if you could see when they are made to stand before the Fire, they will say, "Oh, would that we had been returned, and we would not deny the signs of our Lord, and we would be among the believers."
Nay, but that which they hide before them are manifest to them; but if they return to it, they shall revert to what they have been forbidden, and verily they are liars.
And they say: "There is nothing but our life of this world, and we shall not be raised again."
And if you see them, when they are made to stand before their Lord, He will say, "Is this not real?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord," and He will say, "Then taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve."
Those who deny the meeting with Allah will be lost. Until when the Hour comes on them suddenly, they say, "Alas for us!" And they will bear their burdens on their backs, and they will bear their burdens on their backs.
The life of this world is nothing but a sport and a sport; and the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Will you not then understand?
We know that what they say grieves you. It is not you who deny it, but the wrongdoers deny the signs of Allah.
Messengers were denied before thee, but they endured patiently, and they endured patiently, until Our help came to them. And there is none to change the words of Allah. And there has come to you the Messengers of the messengers.
And if their aversion is hard for you, then if you seek a tunnel into the earth or a ladder to the sky, then bring them a sign, and if Allah had so willed, He would have brought them all guidance, so do not be of the ignorant.
Those who hear (the truth) listen to the call of Allah, and those who are dead will be resurrected, and they will be returned to Him.
They say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "God is able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
And there is not a creature on earth nor a bird flying on its wings, but they are like you as communities; We have not neglected anything in the Book; then to their Lord they will be gathered.
And those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb in darkness; whom Allah wills, He leaveth astray; and whomsoever He pleases, He placeth on the right way.
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or the Hour comes upon you, will you call upon other than Allah if you are truthful?"
Nay, but you call upon Him, and if He wills, He will remove it from you, and you will forget what you associate with Him.
We sent Messengers before you, and afflicted them with distress and hardship that they might humble themselves.
So why did they not worship Him when Our punishment came to them, and their hearts were hardened, and Satan has made them seem attractive to what they did.
So when they forgot that which they had been reminded, We opened them to the gates of all things, and when they had been blessed, We seized them suddenly, and they became in despair.
And the people of the evildoers were cut off, and all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say, "Have you considered, if God should take away your hearing and your sight and set up a seal upon your hearts, who can bring it to you to bring you back to God?
Say: "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you suddenly or openly, will any one be destroyed except the unjust?"
And We send not the Messengers but as bearers of good tidings and warners; but those who believe and mend their ways shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And for those who deny Our signs, they will suffer the punishment of a painful punishment.
Say, "I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of God, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me. Say, "Are the blind and the blind?" Do you not reflect?
And warn those who fear their Lord, that they will be gathered to their Lord, and they will have no protector nor intercessor, that they may guard against evil.
And do not turn away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and at the evening, seeking His countenance. They do not have any account for you, nor are you accountable for them, nor are you responsible for them.
So We test some of them with some of them, so that they say, "Are these those whom Allah has favoured us?"
And when those who believe in Our Signs come to you, say: Peace be upon you; your Lord has inscribed mercy upon Himself; so that if any of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and amend, then He is Forgiving, Merciful.
And thus do We explain the signs, so that the path of the wicked may be manifest.
Say, "I am forbidden to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah. Say, "I do not follow your desires; I have gone astray, and I am not of the guided ones."
Say, "I have been clear to you from my Lord, and you deny it. I am not responsible for what you hasten. This is nothing but Allah's command, and He is the best of judges."
Say: "If I had been asked for that which you were asking, I would have been settled between you and you. God knows best the wrongdoers."
And with Him are the keys of the unseen. He knows what is in the land and the sea; and He knows what is in the land and the sea; and there is not a grain but a leaf, nor a grain of the earth, nor is it in the earth, nor can it be a manifest Book.
And He it is Who takes your souls by night, and He knows what you have done by day, then He raises you up, that a term appointed be fulfilled; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you did.
And He is the Omnipotent over His servants, and He sends guardians over you; when death approaches one of you, Our angels will die, and they do not perceive.
Then they will be returned to Allah, the True, the True. That is the command of Allah; and He is the swiftest in reckoning.
Say, "Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him humbly and secretly? If He delivers us from this, we will surely be among the thankful."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "It is Allah Who delivers you from them and from every distress, then you ascribe partners to Him."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "He has power to punish you from above you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to bring you into sects into sects, and to make you taste some of the violence of others. See how We explain the communications to you that they may understand."
And your people deny it, and it is the truth. Say: I am not a guardian over you.
For every time there is an appointed time, and you will know.
And when you see those who dispute concerning Our signs, turn away from them until they engage in other discourse; and if Satan makes you forget, then do not sit after the people of the evildoers.
And those who guard (against evil) will not be able to hasten on them on account of their deeds, but they are admonished, so that they may fear.
And (as for) those who take their religion, and sport and sport, and give them the life of this world, and do not remind them of the Qur'an, and do not forget the Qur'an, nor will he be able to take it out of their own soul. And if they do not have any protector, it will not be accepted from them. They will have no protector and a painful punishment.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall we worship besides Allah that which does not profit us, nor will He hurt us, and that which Allah has guided us, and that which they returned to their backs?
And (that is) the prayer (of prayer) and fear Him, and He is the One to Whom you will be gathered.
It is He who has created the heavens and the earth in truth; and on the day when He will say, "Be!" and it is; and His Word is the truth; and on the Day when the Trumpet shall be blown, and the Trumpet shall be blown; and He is the Wise, the Wise.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols for idols? I will see you and your people in manifest error."
Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who have faith.
When the night covered him, he saw a star, and he said, "This is my Lord;" but when it set, he said, "I do not love what I do."
When he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord;" but when it set, he said, "If my Lord does not guide me, I will surely be among the people who go astray."
When he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my Lord; this is greater than this." When it set, he said, "O my people, I am quit of what you associate with Him."
“I have turned to Him who has created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the idolaters.”
And his people disputed with him. He said, "Do you dispute with me concerning Allah, that He has guided me, and I do not fear that which you associate with Him? My Lord comprehends all things in knowledge. Will you not remember?"
And how should I fear that which you associate with Him, while you do not fear that you have associated with Allah what He has not sent down to you, but if you know that the two parties is better than the two parties?
Those who believe and do not follow their faith, for them is a secure security, and they are rightly guided.
And this was Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise in degrees whomsoever We please; surely your Lord is Wise, Knowing.
And We gave Ibrahim (Abraham) Isaac and Ya'qub, and We guided him, and We guided Noah and his family, and of his progeny, and of the progeny of David and Solomon and Job and Aaron and Aaron and Aaron, and thus do We reward those who do good.
And Zakariya and John and Jesus and Elias, and all of them are righteous.
And Ishmael, and Elisha, and Jonah, and Lot, and all the people of the worlds.
And among their fathers and their descendants and their brothers, and We chose them, and We guided them on the Straight Path.
Such is the guidance of Allah; He guides whom He pleases.
These are those whom We gave to the Book, and the wisdom, and the prophethood; but if they disbelieve in it, We have made a people a people who deny not.
Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so follow your guidance. Say, "I do not ask any reward for you. This is a reminder for the worlds."
And they did not have a covenant with Allah, because they said, "What has been sent down to us from Allah?" Say, "He has sent down the Book and the Gospel." Say, "We have been sent down to the Book of Moses and the guidance of the people." Say, "We have been sent down to you, and you do not know what you were doing." Say, "God has given you the Book." Say, "This is the Book."
And this is the Book which We have sent down, confirming that which is before it, and that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it, and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are obedient to their prayers.
And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or says, "It has been revealed to me," and he has been sent down to him, or he says, "I am sent down to the Book," or if you do not see what God has sent down, and if you see the angels, the angels will have a humiliating punishment.
And indeed you have come to Us as We created you first, and you left behind your backs, and We have not seen you with your intercessors, and We see not with you those whom you asserted that you asserted that you were partners.
It is Allah Who brings forth the grain and the date-tree, the living and the dead, and He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead. That is Allah, how you are turned away.
He is the One Who makes the dawn, and He has made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon, and the sun and the moon; this is the decree of the Almighty, the Knowing.
And it is He Who has made the stars for you, that you may be able to guide them in the darkness of the land and the sea; indeed We have made clear to you the signs for a people who know.
And He it is Who has created you from a single soul, and then a resting place and a resting-place; indeed We have made clear to you the signs for a people who understand.
And He it is Who sends down water from the sky, then We bring forth therewith of it all kinds of plants, and of which We have brought forth fruits, from which We bring forth crops of date trees, trees and pomegranates, and the fruits of date-trees, and the fruits and the pomegranates, and the fruits, and the fruits, and the fruits, and it is the fruits of the living.
And they ascribe to the jinn with the jinn, and He has created them, and they falsely ascribe themselves to Him, and ascribe sons and daughters. Glory be to Him! High is He above what they ascribe to Him.
Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? How can He have a son, and He has no consort, and He created all things, and He has knowledge of all things?
Such is Allah, your Lord; there is no god but He, the Creator of all things; therefore worship Him, and He is the Guardian of all things.
Vision comprehends Him not; He comprehends all things, and He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Indeed, there has come to you clear proofs from your Lord; so whoever sees, it is for his own good; and whoever blinds himself, it is to his own loss; and I am not a keeper over you.
And thus do We explain the signs, and that they may say, "You have studied," and that We may make it clear to a people who know.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, there is no god but He, and turn away from the polytheists.
And if Allah had willed, they would not have associated others with Him, and We have not made you a keeper over them, and you are not a keeper over them.
Do not insult those whom they invoke besides Allah, lest they should revile Allah in ignorance. Thus We have made their deeds fair-seeming to them, and to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they did.
And they swear by Allah with their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they would believe in it. Say: "These signs are with Allah." Say: "If only they believe, they will not believe."
And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes, and they will not believe in it, and We will leave them in their rebellion in their rebellion.
And if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken to them, and We had gathered together all things before them, they would not believe unless Allah willed, but most of them are ignorant.
And thus have We made for every Prophet an enemy from among the jinn and the jinn, and some of the jinn, who inspire each other with speech, and made it an object of discourse, so that if your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it. So leave them alone.
And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with it, and that they may be the ones who do what they are doing.
Shall I seek other than Allah as a judge? He has sent down to you the Book. Those who have been given the Book know that it is the truth from your Lord. So do not be among the doubters.
And the word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment and justice. None can change His words; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And if you obey most of those on earth, they will lead you astray from the path of Allah.
Your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
If you believe in God, then you have to believe in Him.
And what aileth you that ye eat not of the name of Allah, that He may make clear to you what Allah has forbidden you? And verily, many of them have been compelled to follow their desires. And most certainly many of them follow their desires. Lo! thy Lord knows best the transgressors.
And forgive the sin and the sin, and those who commit sins shall be recompensed for what they have done.
And do not eat of that which Allah has not mentioned to you. That is a sin, and the devils inspire their hearts to dispute with you; and if you obey them, then you are idolaters.
Who has brought him to life, and made him a light, and made him light in the way of the people, like he who walks in the darkness, and he is not able to bring it out of the darkness? Thus do they seem fair to the disbelievers.
And thus We have made in every town its leaders, in order to make mischief therein, and they do not make mischief in any way, and they do not know.
And when a sign comes to them, they say, "We will not believe until we have been given the Messengers of God." Allah knows best what He sent to His servants, and those who commit evil will have a painful punishment.
And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his heart to Islam; and whomsoever He wills to go astray, He makes his heart narrow and constricted, as if he were climbing into the sky. Those who do not believe in the way of Allah will be punished.
This is the Straight Path of your Lord. We have explained Our signs for a people who remember.
For them is a place of security for their Lord, and He is their guardian.
And on the Day when He will gather them all together, and say, "O assembly of jinn, many of you have been weak." The people of the people say, "Our Lord, we have made some of us one of another." Then, when We have given you a term, then say, "Your abode is hell." He will say, "Your abode is hell." And God is Wise, Knowing.
And thus We have made the wrongdoers friends of one another, because of what they used to do.
O assembly of jinn and men, did not Messengers come to you from among yourselves, reciting to you My signs and warning you of this Day of yours? They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves." They will say, "We bear witness against them." They will bear witness against themselves. They will bear witness against themselves.
That is because your Lord did not destroy the cities unjustly while their people were unaware.
And all of them are in ranks, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
Your Lord is Self-sufficient, All-merciful. If He wills, He will destroy you and bring you to the successors, and He will raise you up as He pleases you.
Verily, the promise which you have been promised will surely come to pass.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Work according to your deeds, and I am rightly-doing. Soon you will come to know that the reward of the Hereafter will be the end of the Hereafter; surely the unjust will not prosper.
And there shall be a portion of the crops and cattle whom He has created, and say, "This is for Allah," and they say, "This is for Allah," and that is for our associates. And what they associate with Allah will not reach them. And what they associate with Allah is what they judge.
And how many of the idolaters have made fair seeming to their own children, that they may make their own fair deeds seem fair to them, so that they may make them go to confusion, and that Allah would not have made them so that they would not be able to do so; so leave them, and what they fabricate.
And they say, "It is forbidden for the crops and the crops." They say, "We have no power except for what we please, and some of them are forbidden." And they are cattle and cattle, and they do not mention the name of God. They will be recompensed against God.
And they say: "What is in the wombs of the cattle is for our people, and for our wives, and for our wives; but if they die, they shall have all that they have." He will punish them with their punishment; surely Allah is Wise, Knowing.
Those who have lost their children foolishly, without knowledge, without knowledge, and forbid what Allah has provided for them. They are indeed the losers, and they have gone astray. They have gone astray.
And He it is Who has produced the gardens and the trees, and the date-palms, and the crops, and the olives, and the pomegranates, and the olives, and the olives, and the olives, and the harvest, and the harvest, and the harvest thereof; and do not be wasteful, and do not be wasteful.
And of the cattle and the earth, and eat of what Allah has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is to you an open enemy.
Eight wives, goats, goats, and goats. Say, "Who has forbidden the two males or the two females?" Say, "Who has forbidden the two males, or what the two females contain?"
And of the camels, and of the camels, and of the cattle, or the two males, or the two females, or the two females, or when you were witnesses? When you were commanded, you were witnesses when you were witnesses. And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against God? God does not guide the unjust people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "It is not lawful for me that I have been sent down to the <unk> (i.e., <unk>), except that which is forbidden from death, or of blood, or of blood, or of the blood of swine, and that which is in the breasts, or that which is in the breasts, or that which is in the name of Allah." But whoever is driven to necessity, neither desiring nor exceeding the limit, then surely your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.
And We forbade the people of the Jews all kinds of fat, and We forbade to them the fat of the fat and the goats, or the entrails, or the entrails, or the entrails, or the entrails, that We should punish them for their sins; and We have given them the truth.
If they deny you, say, "Your Lord is the Lord of mercy, and His punishment will not be averted from the guilty people."
They will say, "Had Allah willed, we would not have associated anything with Him, nor did we have our forefathers, nor did we have forbidden anything." Thus did those who were before them deny the truth until they tasted Our punishment. Say, "Bring us a proof. You only conjecture."
Say: "If Allah had been with the conclusive religion, He would have guided you all."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Bring your witnesses, if you bear witness to their witnesses, so do not bear witness against them, and do not bear witness to them who deny Our signs and who do not believe in the Hereafter.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Show me what your Lord has forbidden you. Say: 'Do not associate anything with Him, and be good to your parents, and do not kill your children. Do not kill your children. Do not kill your children, and do not kill them. This is what God has given you. That is what He has revealed to you. This is what God has given you.
And do not approach the property of the orphan, except for the best of what is best, until he comes to maturity, and give full measure and weight. We do not impose on any soul beyond its capacity. And when you speak, then if you speak, then if you speak, then if you speak, then if you speak, then if you speak, and the promise of God is complete.
“And this is my Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not other paths, for they will separate you away from His way.
Then We gave Musa (Moses) the Book (the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.), that We might make it a clear explanation of all things, and a guidance and a mercy, that they may believe in the meeting with their Lord.
And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, that you may receive mercy.
Lest you should say, "The Book was sent down to two groups before us, and we were unaware of it."
Or lest they should say, "If the Book had been sent down to us, we would certainly have been more guided than them." Now there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who is more unjust than he who rejects the signs of Allah and turns away from them? We shall punish them with a painful punishment.
Are they waiting for the angels, or the angels, or some of the signs of your Lord? On the Day when the signs of your Lord will come to pass, the people will not believe in it, nor will they believe. Say, "Wait, we are waiting." Say, "Wait, we too are waiting."
As for those who divide their religion and became sects, you have no share in them. Their affair is with Allah; then He will inform them of what they did.
Whoever brings a good deed shall receive a harvest like it; and whoever does evil, it shall be recompensed for him, and they will not be wronged.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Verily, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a religion of religion, the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say: "Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the Worlds."
There is no partner in Him, and I am commanded to be the first of those who submit to Him.
Say: "Shall I seek other than Allah as Lord, and He is the Lord of all things?"
And He it is Who has made you inherit the earth, and raised some of you above others in ranks, that He may try you in that which He has given you; surely your Lord is swift in retribution; surely He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Alif, Lam, Meem.
This Book has been sent down to you, so that it may not be in your breast, so that you may warn it, and a reminder for the believers.
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and follow not the friends of Him, but you remember that you are little.
And how many a township have We destroyed, so Our punishment came to them, or they were sleeping at noon.
And when Our punishment came to them, they said, "We were wrongdoers."
Then We will surely question those to whom the Messengers were sent, and We will certainly question the messengers.
Then We shall inform them of their knowledge, and we were not absent.
And the weighing on that day will be true, and those whose scales are heavy will be successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, they are those who have lost their souls because they used to deny Our signs.
And We have established you in the earth and made for you in it a means of livelihood, but little thanks.
And We created you, then fashioned you, then We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam." So they prostrated themselves, except Satan, who was not of those who prostrated.
He said, "What prevented you from what you say?" He said, "I am better than that; I am better than you, and You created him from clay."
He said, "Get it down from the sky. So do not be arrogant for you. So go forth, and you are among the losers."
He said, "Give me respite until the Day of Resurrection."
He said, "You are given respite."
He said: "Because Thou hast led me astray, I will surely wait for them on the Straight Path."
Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and from their right and on their left, and You will not find most of them grateful."
He said, "Get away from heaven, and go away from them. I will fill hell with you all together."
"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat of it wherever ye desire; but approach not this tree, lest ye be of the wrongdoers."
Then Satan whispered to them that he might manifest to them what was hidden from them of their shame, and he said, "Your Lord, save you from this tree lest you should become angels or become immortal."
And he swore to them, saying, "I am a sincere adviser to you."
So he caused them to fall down; so when they tasted their nakedness, their shame became manifest to them; and their Lord called them out of the Garden, and did not say to you, "Did I not forbid you that Satan is an open enemy to you?"
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will surely be among the losers."
(Allah) said: "Go ye down, for ye are enemies of one another, and for the earth there is a place of enjoyment and provision for a time."
He said, "Therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought forth."
O children of Adam! We have sent down to you a garment that may cover your nakedness, and a garment, and a garment, and the garment of piety; this is the best of the signs, so that they may remember.
O Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you, as he got your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their raiment, to expose them their shame; and he and his tribe watch you from a position where ye cannot see them. We made the devils friends for those who believe.
And when they commit an indecency, they say, "We found our fathers doing it," and God commanded us. Say: "Why do Allah not command such an indecency?" Say, "Allah does not command indecency."
Say: "My Lord has commanded justice, and set your faces at every place of worship, and call upon Him, making the religion sincerely to Him. He created you as He created you, so you will return."
He has guided the people, and some of them are misguided. They have taken the devils for friends instead of Allah, and they think that they are rightly guided.
O children of Adam! wear your apparel at every time of worship, and eat and drink and drink, but do not be excessive, for God loves not the wasters.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has brought forth for His servants and the good things?" Say: "This is for those who believe in this world and on the Day of Resurrection. Thus do We explain the signs for those who know."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has forbidden me (all) that is shameful and open, and that which is hidden, and that which is hidden, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has no authority, and that you say concerning Allah that which you do not know."
And every nation shall have a term; when their term comes, they shall not be able to delay a single hour, nor shall they precede it.
O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses, then whoever fears Allah and reforms, there shall be no fear on them nor shall they grieve.
And those who deny Our signs and treat them with arrogance, they are the companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His signs? Those whose portion is given to them will be given to them, "Where are the people whom you used to invoke besides Allah?" They will say, "Where you were called to worship besides Allah, and bear witness against themselves."
He will say: "Enter the fire of Hell, which you have gone before, and those who were before you, and the people of the nations, when it will be as a destruction, and when it will come to pass, the last of them will say, 'Our Lord! Our Lord! You have led us astray, so that He may punish them for a double punishment.' He will say: "This is a double punishment."
And the first of them will say, "You have not been arrogant for us, so taste the punishment for what you used to earn."
As for those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, the gates of heaven will not be opened, nor will they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. Thus do We recompense the guilty.
For them shall be a bed of fire and folds over them; and thus do We recompense the unjust.
And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We impose no burden on any soul beyond its capacity; these are the dwellers of the Garden; therein shall they abide.
And We shall remove from them what is in their hearts, and rivers flow beneath them, and they will say, "Praise be to Allah, Who has guided us." If Allah had not guided us, we would not have been guided, and we would not have been guided. Our Lord has brought the truth to you.
And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of the Fire: "We have indeed found that which our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true?" They will say, "Yes," and a crier will call between them.
Those who hinder (men) from the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked, and they do not believe in the Hereafter.
And there shall be a barrier between them and on the heights, and on the heights will be men who recognize their marks, and they will call out to the dwellers of Paradise, "Peace be upon you." They will not enter it, but they will have hope.
