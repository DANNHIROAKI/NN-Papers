# **`CV-MIM`**: Learning View-Disentangled Human Pose Representation by Contrastive **C**ross\-**V**iew **M**utual **I**nformation **M**aximization

We propose an approach for learning disentangled representations for human poses and their camera views for view-invariant pose-based action recognition and view classification. Please refer to our [CVPR'21 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01405) for more details.
