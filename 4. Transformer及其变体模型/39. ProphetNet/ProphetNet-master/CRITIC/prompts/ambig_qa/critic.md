> Evidence: [United States at the FIFA World Cup - Wikipedia] The United States participated in every World Cup from 1990 through 2014, but did not qualify in 2018, marking first time the team had missed a World Cup since 1986.

Question: Where was tin pan alley in new york city?
Proposed Answer: Tin Pan Alley was a nickname for the collection of New York City music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. So the answer is: New York City

Question: What does barium do in a ct scan?
Proposed Answer: Barium is used in CT scans to help highlight the digestive system. So the answer is: highlight the digestive system

What's the problem with the above answer?

1. Plausibility:

The question asks for the function of barium in a CT scan, and the answer is "highlight the digestive system", which is a function. So it's plausible.

2. Truthfulness:

Let's search the proposed answer:

> Search Query: Barium is used in CT scans to help highlight the digestive system
> Evidence: [Barium Sulfate (Enhancer)] Barium sulfate works by coating the inside of your esophagus, stomach, or intestines which allows them to be seen more clearly on a CT scan or other radiologic (x-ray) examination.

According to the evidence, the proposed answer is not completely accurate.

Let's search the question in google:

> Search Query: What does barium do in a ct scan? site: wikipedia.org
> Evidence: [Barium sulfate suspension - Wikipedia] Barium sulfate suspension, often simply called barium, is a contrast agent used during X-rays. Specifically it is used to improve visualization of the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, intestines) on plain X-ray or computed tomography.

The evidence suggests that barium is used to "improve visualization of the gastrointestinal tract", which includes the digestive system. Therefore, the proposed answer should be more specific by staing "improve visualization".

> Search Query: Why barium used in CT scans?
> Evidence: [What To Expect Before Your CT Scan - St. Elizabeth's Medical Center] The barium helps to highlight body areas for the CT scan. If you are having a scan of a body part other than the abdomen you should arrive 30 minutes before your appointed time.

The evidence suggests that barium helps "highlight body areas" for the CT scan, not specifically the digestive system. However, it is possible that barium is used to highlight the digestive system in many cases, so the proposed answer is not complete.

Conclusion: While the answer "highlight the digestive system" is a common usage of barium in CT scans, it is not a complete description of barium's function. A more complete answer would be "to improve visualization of the gastrointestinal tract."

Question: What does barium do in a ct scan?
Here's the most possible answer: Barium is used in CT scans to improve visualization of the gastrointestinal tract, including the digestive system. So the answer is: to improve visualization of the gastrointestinal tract.

The question asks for the location of the fort, and the answer is "Fort Sumter", which may be a location. So it's plausible.

2. Truthfulness:

Let's search the question in google:

> Evidence: [Civil War Begins - U.S. Senate] April 12, 1861 At 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861, Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter in South Carolinaâ€™s Charleston Harbor. Less than 34 hours later, Union forces surrendered.

The evidence suggests that the first shot of the Civil War was fired at Fort Sumter, which is consistent with the proposed answer.

We then need to check whether Fort Sumter is located in Charleston, South Carolina.

> Search Query: Where is Fort Sumter located?
> Evidence: [Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park (U.S. National ...] Fort Sumter is located in the middle of Charleston Harbor, and is only accessible by ferry rides through Fort Sumter Tours.

Conclusion: From the above evidence we know that the first shot of the Civil War was fired at Fort Sumter, and Fort Sumter is located in Charleston, the reasoning process is correct. However, the proposed answer should specify the location "Charleston" rather than only state "Fort Sumter".

Question: Where was the fort located at which the first shot of the civil war was fired?
Here's the most possible answer: The first shot of the Civil War was fired at Fort Sumter, which is located in Charleston, South Carolina. So the answer is: Charleston, South Carolina.

Question: Who plays wilmas mom in the flintstones movie?
Proposed Answer: Wilma's mom is played by Elizabeth Perkins in the 1994 live-action film The Flintstones. So the answer is: Elizabeth Perkins

What's the problem with the above answer?

1. Plausibility:

The question asks for the name of the actor who plays wilmas mom, and the answer is "Elizabeth Perkins", which is a name. So it's plausible.

2. Truthfulness:

Let's search the question in google:

> Search Query: Who played Wilma's mom in the flintstones movie? site: wikipedia.org
> Evidence: [Elizabeth Perkins - Wikipedia] Elizabeth Ann Perkins (born November 18, 1960 ) is an American actress.

The evidence does not mention Wilma's mom in the flintstones movie.

Let's search the proposed answer:

> Search Query: Wilma's mom is played by Elizabeth Perkins in the 1994 live-action film The Flintstones.
> Evidence: [The Flintstones (film) - Wikipedia] The film stars John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble, Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma Flintstone, and Rosie O'Donnell as Betty Rubble, along with Kyle MacLachlan as Cliff Vandercave, a villainous executive-vice president of Fred's company, Halle Berry as Sharon Stone, his seductive secretary, and Elizabeth Taylor (in her final theatrical film appearance), as Pearl Slaghoople, Wilma's mother.

The evidence shows that Elizabeth Perkins did appear in The Flintstones movie as Wilma Flintstone, but not as Wilma's mother. And Elizabeth Taylor played as Pearl Slaghoople, the role of Wilma's mother in The Flintstones movie.

> Search Query: Who played Wilma's mom in the flintstones movie?
> Evidence: [] The Flintstones / Wilma Flintstone / Mother / Played by Elizabeth Taylor

The evidence shows that Elizabeth Taylor played the role of Wilma's mother, which contradicts the "Elizabeth Perkins" in the proposed answer.

Considering all above evidence, we need to correct the answer.

Question: Who plays wilmas mom in the flintstones movie?
Here's the most possible answer: Elizabeth Taylor played the role of Wilma's mother (ie., Pearl Slaghoople) in the 1994 live-action film The Flintstones. So the answer is: Elizabeth Taylor.
