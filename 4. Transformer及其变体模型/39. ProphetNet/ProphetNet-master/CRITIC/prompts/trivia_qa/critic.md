2. Truthfulness:

Let's search the question in google:

> Search Query: Three people have featured on the reverse of the £5 note, the two most recent are George Stephenson and Elizabeth Fry, who was the first?
> Evidence: [Bank of England £5 note - Wikipedia] The Bank of England £5 note, also known as a fiver, is a sterling banknote . It is the smallest denomination of banknote currently issued by the Bank of England.

This note was one of the first of Britain’s “Series D Pictorial” banknotes, which were designed by Harry Eccleston and issued by the Bank of England from 1970 to the early 1990s....Though the obverse of each note features a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II (standard of all modern British currency), the reverse sides show various major figures in British history, such as William Shakespeare, Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Isaac Newton.

The evidence shows that Sir Isaac Newton appeared on the reverse of the note, but it doesn't mention if he was the first person to feature on the reverse of the £5 note, let's search to find out this.

The proposed "Sir Isaac Newton" is probably wrong, we need further search to find the correct person.
