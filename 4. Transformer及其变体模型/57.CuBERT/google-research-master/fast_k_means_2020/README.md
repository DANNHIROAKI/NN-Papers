# Fast k-means

This is an efficient C++ implementation of the algorithms and baselines from
"Fast and Accurate k-means++ via Rejection Sampling".

## This is a command to compile the code

One can compile all the files together. The main file is fast_k_means_main.cc.

## Input description

We expect the number of points and number of dimensions in the first line
(space separated). Followed by one line for each input point, describing the
dimensions in double format (space separated).

Input Example:
3 2
1.00 2.50
3.30 4.12
0.0 -10.0

## Output description

There is no fixed output, more description is provided in fast_k_means_main.cc.

## The command to run the code.
The code does not have any external dependencies nor requires flags.
One can simply run the code.
