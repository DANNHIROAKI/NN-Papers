# Speech Embedding Examples

This repository contains three example Colab notebooks that demonstrate how to
use the speech embedding tf-hub module.

 * [speech_commands.ipynb](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/speech_embedding/speech_commands.ipynb) Demonstrates how to train a keyword spotting model on the speech commands dataset.
 * [record_train.ipynb](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/speech_embedding/record_train.ipynb) Shows how a keyword spotting model can be trained on your own voice (requires a microphone).
 * [kws_synth.ipynb](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/speech_embedding/kws_synth.ipynb) Train a keyword spotting model on synthetic data.
