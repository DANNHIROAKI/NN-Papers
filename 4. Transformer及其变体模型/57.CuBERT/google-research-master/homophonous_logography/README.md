This directory contains the supporting code for
["The Taxonomy of Writing Systems: How to Measure how Logographic a System is"](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00409)
article that proposes a novel measure of the degree of logography that uses an
attention based sequence-to-sequence model trained to predict the spelling of a
token from its pronunciation in context.
