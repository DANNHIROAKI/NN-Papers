In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
Master of the Day of Resurrection.
You alone alone, and we will help.
Guide us on the straight path,
Such are the path of those whom Allah has bestowed upon His servants, and those who are upon them are astray.
<unk>
This is the Book, there is no doubt about it. It is no doubt for it.
who believe in the unseen, and perform the prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
And they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and they believe in the Hereafter.
They are on guidance from their Lord. Such are the successful.
Those who disbelieve, whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearts, and their hearts are veiled, and there is a great punishment for them.
And among mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they believe not.
They seek to deceive Allah and the believers, but they deceive themselves but they do not understand.
In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has sealed their hearts. They will have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Do not cause corruption on earth," they say, "We are only reformers.”
Indeed, they do not understand the mischief, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, “Believe in the like of it," they say, "Shall we believe? Shall we believe?” They do not know the truth.
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe." But when they privily, they say, "We are with you. We are not at the same.”
Allah mocks them, and letteth them wander astray in their transgression.
These are the ones who purchased error for error, so their profit will not profit them, nor will they be guided.
Their likeness is like those who kindled the fire, and when it lit it, Allah took their light on their light, and left them in darkness.
Deaf, dumb, and blind, and they will not return.
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, and thunder, and thunder, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears, and they thrust their fingers out of the thunderclap. God encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away their sight; whenever it shines to them, they walk to it, and when they stand on it, they stand on it. Had Allah willed, He could have taken their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah has power over all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you, so that ye may fear.
It is He Who has made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a canopy, and sent down water from the sky, and brings forth fruits from it, and then, you do not know with Him.
And if you are in doubt with what We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it, and call your call to Allah, if you are truthful.
And if you do not, then, you will not be able to do it, and the Fire whose fuel is fuel, and the fuel for the disbelievers.
And give good news to those who believe and do good works, that they will enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will be given it as fruits, and they will say, "This is what we had been given before before.” They will have spouses, and they will abide therein forever.
Allah does not guide a similitude, except a gnat of a gnat, except a gnat. Those who believe will know that it is the truth from their Lord. Those who deny the truth say, "What is God's creation?” He leads astray, and He does not guide them.
Those who break Allah's covenant after validating it, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption in the earth. These are the losers.
Why do you not disbelieve in Allah? He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then will cause you to die, and you will be returned to Him.
It is He who created the earth for you, then then He turned the heavens and the earth, then He created the heavens and the earth; and He is Cognizant of everything.
And when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to make a viceroy on the earth." They said, “Do you make it who will cause corruption in it, and shed blood, and we glorify your Lord.” He said, “I know what you do not know.”
He taught Adam the names, then He created them. He said, “Produce your names, if you are truthful.”
They said: "Glory be to Thee! We have no knowledge that we have no knowledge. Indeed, You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." Then when they gave them their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and what you reveal?”
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they prostrated themselves, but they refused themselves, and he was among the disbelievers.
And We said, "O Adam, you and your wife dwell in Paradise, and eat from it wherever you wish, and do not approach this tree, lest you are wrongdoers.’
Then Satan tempted them from their people, and caused them to be in the state of the land, and We said: "Get down to you, and you will be one another."
Then Adam received from his Lord a Word, and He turned his repentance; surely He is the Relenting, the Merciful.
He said, "Go down from it, and there is come to you, and if there comes to you from My guidance, he will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.”
But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the dwellers of the Fire, abiding therein forever.
O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant, and fulfill My covenant, and fear Me, and fear Me.
And believe in what has been sent down to you, and do not believe in it; and do not sell My signs for a paltry price, and fear Me, and fear Me.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor hide the truth while you hide the truth.
And perform the prayer, and pay regular charity, and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin good good deeds, and forget yourselves? Do you not understand?
And pray at patience and prayer, and Allah is with those who believe.
They think that they will meet their Lord, and to Him they will be returned.
Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you above the worlds.
And guard yourselves against a Day when no soul will avail another soul, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who inflicted you with evil torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women. This was a great trial for you.
And when We took the sea for you, and We drowned you and drowned the people of Pharaoh, and you were looking.
And when We appointed Moses for forty nights, then he took you as a Calf, and you were wrongdoers.
Then We pardoned you, so that you might be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, you have indeed wronged yourselves against God. So turn your Creator to your Creator, and kill him. That is best for you, and He will forgive you. He is the All-clement, the All-merciful."
And when you said, “O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah.” Then you struck them at the thunderbolt.
Then We gave you the life of your life so that you may be grateful.
And We sent down the clouds with you, and We sent you manna and quails, and quails, “Eat of the good things We have provided you, and do not wrong them.”
And when We said, “Enter this town, and eat it wherever you wish, and enter the gate bowing with humility, and say: 'We will forgive you your sins; we will forgive you your sins, and We will increase the virtuous.”
But those who were unjust changed changed to those who were unjust. So We tasted the wrongdoers for a severe punishment, so that they were wrongdoers.
And when Moses prayed for his people, We said, “Strike your staff with the rock.” And gushed forth from it twelve springs. And every tribe gushed forth from the water, and said, “Eat of God, and do not roam the earth.”
And when you said, "O Moses, we have no power to do not save us, and our Lord will make us go back to our land, and then we will return to your Lord, and then our Lord and your head, and your mates, and your mates, and the pair of your animals.” That is because they rejected the signs of Allah, and that you may be able to eat it. They behaved their sins and the prophets. That is because they disobeyed the signs of God."
Those who believe, and those who believe, and the Sabians and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do good deeds, their reward shall be their reward with their Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And when We took a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you, saying, “Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember that you may fear.”
Then you turned away from it, and you would not have mercy for God's mercy and mercy upon you.
And you did not know the people who violated the Sabbath, so We said to them, "Be apes, despised.”
And We made it a deterrent for them, and a guidance for them, and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
And when Moses said to his people, "God commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Have you make fun from us?" He said, "I seek refuge from God, the ignorant.”
They said, "Call upon your Lord to make us clear what He has given us." He said, "He says, "He says, "He says, "He says, “And neither, nor, neither, nor, nor, between the middle of all things.”
They said, "Call to your Lord to make us clear to what He wants to reveal." He said, "He says, "He says, "He says, "It is a yellow cow.”
They said, “Pray to your Lord for us that He may make clear to us the cow." And if Allah wills, we will surely be able.
He said, "He says, ‘He says, “It is no cow, nor ploughing to plow the earth, and there was not a field to the earth.” They said, “We have brought it.” Then they sacrificed them, and they were not aware.
And when you slew a man, then quarrelled about it, and Allah knows what you hide.
And We said, “Strike him with the dead.” Thus God brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, so that you may understand.
Then your hearts hardened hardened, as though they are like rocks, and harder, and there are rocks, and there are some rocks which split forth from them, and there are some of them that split asunder from Allah; and there is some of them, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you think that they will not believe in you? The party of them are a party of a party of them, and then understood it, after they understood it.
When they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe.” But when they are privily with one another, they say, “What do you speak to speak to them?" They will wish to mention your Lord. Do you not understand?
Do they not know that Allah knows what they hide and what they disclose?
And among them are unlettered who follow the Book, but they do not follow it, and they are only guessing.
Woe to those who write their hands with the Book, and they say, "This is from God." So woe to them for a small price, and woe to them for what they earn.
And they say, “The Fire will not touch us for a number of days." Say, "Have you taken a covenant from Allah, He will not promise His promise, or do you speak about God what you do not know?"
Nay, but those who do evil and wrong evil deeds—these are the inmates of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
As for those who believe and do good works, they shall be the inhabitants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.
And recall when We took the Children of Israel with a covenant, saying, “Worship none none except Allah, and to parents, and to relatives, and to relatives, and to the needy, and to the needy, and speak regularly, and pay the religious charity.”
And when We took a covenant from you, saying, "Do not shed your blood, but expel your people from your homes, and you have brought your homes.”
And ye slew you from the people who slew his people, and made a party of people, and helped the persecution over you. And if they had come to come, there would not have been given you. And if they had come to come with you, he could have no power over him. And if they had reached you, he could have no power over them. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
These are the ones who bought the life of this world, so their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And We gave Moses the Book, and We sent him as a messenger, and We gave him the son of Mary, and We gave him the son of Mary, and We gave him with the Holy Spirit. When there not come to you a messenger, he would not forget it, and they were a party of those who disbelieve.
And they say: Our hearts are uncircumcised. Nay! Allah hath cursed them for their unbelief; so they are not believers.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming what was revealed to them, they prayed to those who disbelieve, when it came to them that they recognized it. So Allah's curse is upon the disbelievers.
Evil is because they have sold what Allah has sent down to them, so that they may not believe in what Allah has sent down to His servants, and that Allah will make His bounty to whom He will of His servants. And they have incurred wrath upon wrath on wrath. And the disbelievers will have a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them: Believe in that which Allah hath sent down, they say: We believe in that which hath been sent down to us, and they disbelieve in it. Say: What who were given you did not believe, and the prophets have been given you.
Moses came to you with clear signs, but you took him as a calf, and you were wrongdoers.
And when We took the covenant with you, and raised you above the Mount of the Mount, and said, "We have given you what you have given to you," they said, "We hear and we obey.” And their hearts absorbed the calf because of their disbelief. Say, "What you have faith.”
Say: 'If the Hereafter is in the providence of Allah, the exclusion of all people will be better for you, if you are truthful."
And they will never be able to die in it for their deeds. God knows the wrongdoers.
And you will surely find them in the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the world. He will replace them for a thousand years. Each one of them will be able to die. God sees what they do.
Say, "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, he has sent it down to it by your heart, it has been sent down to it by your heart, and guidance and glad tidings to the believers.
Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels, and His messengers, and Michael, and Michael, God is the enemy of the faithless.
We have sent down to you clear signs, and none will deny the unbelievers.
Or did they not make a covenant, when it has made them a party of them? Nay, but most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming what has been sent down to them, a party of those who were given the Book behind their backs behind their backs, though they do not know.
And they said, "We have followed the covenant of God," and the chief of the people were made, and they were not arrogant, and they were a people who were in the Book, and they were not in the same. And they did not make any one of them, and they were not in the same. Those who have been given, they have no power in it. They have no power in the Hereafter.
And if they had believed and have been Godwary, they would have been better from Allah, if they but knew.
O you who believe! Do not say, "Do not speak to us," and say, "Unzurna and a painful punishment.”
There is not for the People of the Book and those who disbelieve, lest they should not be able to make a good thing from your Lord. But Allah singles out from His mercy whom He wills; and Allah is Extremely Munificent, Owner.
When We abrogate a verse, or We abrogate it, or We replace it better than a better, or do not know that Allah has power over all things?
Knowest thou not that unto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And ye have no protector or helper.
Do you not say to the Messenger when Moses was questioned before Moses? Anyone who exchanges faith from disbelief has strayed to the Right Path.
Many of the People of the Book wish you, if they turn you away from your faith, and make the clear part of their hearts after the truth has come to them. So forgive them. God has power over all things.
And establish prayer and prayer, and whatever good good for you will find it; and Allah is Seeing of what you do.
And they say, “None will enter Paradise unless he enter the garden.” They say, "These are your own desires.” Say, “Produce your proof if you are truthful.”
Nay, but he who submits his face to Allah and do good works, will have his reward with his Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews say, “The Christians are not based on the religion of Allah.” And the Christians say, "The Christians are not based on the religion of the Jews." They do not know those who do not know the truth. God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning which they differ.
And who is more unjust than one who invokes Allah's name to be mentioned in the name of Allah, and contributes to their ruin? It is not fitting for them to enter them unless they enter them. For them is disgrace in this world and in the Hereafter.
To Allah belong the east and the West. Whichever turn you turn away. God is the Embracer, the Knower.
And they say, “Allah has taken a son." Glory be to Him! He is the All-beneficent, the All-merciful.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a thing, He only says, "Be," and it is.
And those who do not know say, "Why does Allah not speak to us or why bring him a sign?" Thus did those before them. Their hearts are alike. We have made the signs clear for the people who believe.
Indeed, We have sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) as a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner, and you will not be among the inmates of hell.
Nor will the Jews be pleased to be pleased to you, nor do they follow their creed. Say, "The guidance of Allah is true." And if you follow their desires, they will not follow you. And if you follow their desires, you will have no protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book follow it as it ought to follow it; and those who believe not in it, it is they who are the losers.
O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you above the worlds.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And when his Lord tested him with his Lord, and fulfilled them. He said, "I am a leader of you." He said, "My Lord, the wrongdoers.” He said, “The unjust of the wrongdoers.”
And when We made the House a place of place and a place for the people, and We made it a place of prayer, and We appointed Abraham and Ishmael, and We said: Purify My House for those who are modest and those who bow down, and those who bow down and prostrate themselves.
And when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city a city, and provide its fruits with fruits, for those who believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said, “So I do not believe in it, and I will provide him to the punishment of the Fire, and I will be the worst.”
And when Abraham and Ishmael the foundations of the House, they prayed: Our Lord! Accept from us from Thee; surely Thou art the Hearer, the Knower.
Our Lord! make us submissive to Thee and make our progeny submissive to us, and make us the rites of prayer and forgive us; surely Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.
Our Lord, raise them a Messenger from among them, who recite to them Our revelations, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them; indeed You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And who desires the religion of Abraham, except he who follows his religion. We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Surrender," he said, "I have surrendered to the Lord of the Universe."
And Abraham enjoined his sons and Jacob. He said, "O my sons, have Allah has chosen for you, and do not die except Muslims.”
Have you considered when you were present when he said to his sons, "What will you worship me?" They said, "We will worship your God, and your Lord, Ishmael, Isaac, and Isaac. God is the One, the Muslims.”
That was a nation that has passed away, so that they have earned, and for what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what you used to do.
And they say, "Be Jews or Christians, or you will be guided." Say, "We follow the creed of Abraham, and he was not one of the polytheists.”
Say: 'We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets, and that which was given them. We have no distinction over any of them."
If they believe in you, they have believed in it. But if they turn away, then they are in schism. Allah will suffice you from them. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Allah's way, and who is better than the better better than Allah? And we worship Him.
Say, “Do you argue about us about God, and He is our Lord, and your Lord is the Lord of your deeds, and you are your deeds, and we are the worshippers of Him."
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob, and the Tribes, or the Christians, or the Christians, or the Christians? Say, “Are you better?” And who is more unjust than he who conceals God, and who is not aware.
That was a nation that has passed away, for what they have earned, and for what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what you used to do.
And the foolish among the people say, "What has turned them away from their qiblah?" Say, “The East and the West belong to God. He guides whom He wills to the straight path."
We have made you a nation who are a witness to you, and the Messenger, and the Prophet, and We have made no promise to them, so that he may follow those who follow the truth, and who turn away from the way of Allah. Those whom Allah has guided to you. God is All-merciful and All-merciful.
We have seen you in the sky. We will turn you to the direction of your qiblah. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your face towards your face. Those who have been given the Book will know that it is the truth from their Lord. God is aware of what they do.
And if you call them to the Book, they would not follow your direction; nor do they follow your direction, nor do they follow the direction of the direction of the qiblah. And if the knowledge had come to you, they would follow their desires. If you follow their desires, you would surely be wrongdoers.
Those to whom We gave the Book recognise it as they recognize their sons. But some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.
And every one has a direction towards which he inclines. So vie to be good in good deeds. Allah will bring you all together. God has power over all things.
And whencesoever you turn forth, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And whencesoever you turn forth, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you call, then turn your faces towards it. And those who do not have faith, except those who are unjust. So fear Me, and fear not Me; and I will complete My favour on you, and that you may be guided.
As We have sent to you a Messenger from among you, relating to you Our verses, and sanctifying you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teacheth you the Book, and that you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful.
O ye who believe! Seek help in patience and prayer; verily Allah is with the patient.
And do not say to those who are slain in the way of Allah, "They are dead.” Rather, they are alive.
And We will try you with something and hunger, and diminution with goods and lives and lives, and give glad tidings to the patient.
Who, when a misfortune befalls them, they say: "We are Allah, and we will return to Him."
They are the mercy from their Lord and mercy and mercy. These are the rightly guided.
And Safa and Marwa are the symbols of Allah; and whoever makes the sacred House, then performs the House, or performs the House, and performs the House; and whoever does good spontaneously, then Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Those who conceal the Book and the guidance after it We have sent down to them, We have made the Book to the people who have made the Book, and those who have been cursed.
except for those who repent and mend their ways, and make them are the truth; and I am the Relenting, the Merciful.
Those who disbelieve, and die, and die, they are the curse of Allah, and the angels, and the angels.
They will abide in it, and it will not be lightened to them, nor will they be granted respite.
Your God is One God. There is no deity but He, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the ships that sail to the people, and the ships that sail in the sea, and He sends down water from the sky, and He revives the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who have been gathered.
And among mankind are some who take up rivals to Allah. They love Allah for love. And those who believe are in Allah's cause; and those who believe will see the punishment, if they see the punishment. And Allah is the Mighty, the Great.
And when those who followed them will be followed, and they will see the punishment, and they will be formed with their mark.
And they will say, "If only we had been returned to us, we would disown them, and we would disown them." Thus Allah will inform them of their deeds, and they will not enter the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is lawful in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is your open enemy.
He enjoins you to commit vice and indecency, and that you do not know God.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what God has sent down," they say, "Rather, we follow our fathers following us." Even though their fathers had no knowledge, nor were they guided?
The likeness of those who disbelieve, is a likeness of a man who calls nothing to hear, and to not hear anything but yelling, and they are deaf.
O ye who believe! Eat of the good things which We have provided you, and give thanks to Allah, if ye worship Him.
He has forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and the flesh, and the flesh, and the flesh of swine, and that which is in the name of Allah, and that there is no sin in it; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Indeed, those who conceal what Allah has sent down to the Book, and purchase a small price for a small price, they eat nothing in their bellies. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. They will have a painful punishment.
Those are they who have purchased error for guidance, and forgiveness for forgiveness. How how they are the Fire!
That is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth, and those who differ concerning the Book are in extreme schism.
And the angels and the angels are not in any means to you, except that Allah's good is good. To Him, and the angels, and the angels, and the believers, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, they are the ones who are true.
O you who have faith! It is not for the believers to make it to you. It is lawful for them, and he who is pregnant, and his wife is a child, and his wife is a woman who is his wife, and his wife, and his wife, and his wife, and it is a painful punishment.
Do you possess the life of this world for you, so that you may be Godwary.
And when death approaches you, if he leaves upon death, he will bequeath his parents, and to relatives, and to relatives equitably, and the duty is upon the godfearing.
But whoever changes it after he has heard it, it will be no sin for him. Allah is All-hearing and All-knowing.
But whoever commits a testator intentionally, or sin, and sin, and the sin between them, shall not be blamed. God is Forgiving, Merciful.
O ye who believe! Fasting hath been prescribed for you (O Muhammad SAW) as those who have been prescribed, so that you may be godfearing.
On the days of days; but if you are sick, or on a journey, or on a journey, and on a number of a day, it is no ransom on him; and whoever does good, it is better for him; but if you knew, it is better for you.
It is a Book that has been sent down to the people, a guidance, and the guidance, and the Book, and the confirmation of the Book, and that you may find a means of the night, and that it comes to pass on it. God will provide it for you, and He will make it to you. God will provide you to be grateful.
And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then I am near to Me. When I answer the call, he calls to Me, and let them believe in Me, so that they may believe.
It is not lawful for you to inherit your wives. They have made a few of you to make you think that you have your eyes, and He will have turned you away, and He will forgive you your sins, and He will forgive you your sins, and He will forgive you your sins, and He will forgive you in the land, and do not ask them. Thus does Allah clarify the parables to the people.
And do not consume your property unjustly, and do not consume the means of the judges, and devour not the property of the people wrongfully.
They ask you about the crescents. Say: 'These are the people, and the pilgrimage, and the pilgrimage, and the pilgrimage. And do not enter the houses, unless you enter their houses. And fear Allah, so that you may prosper.
And fight in the way of Allah those who fight the cause of Allah, and transgress not; verily Allah loveth not the trespassers.
And kill them wherever you find them, and expel them from them, and fitnah is worse than killing. And if they fight them, they fight them. But if they fight them, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.
But if they desist, then Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And fight them until there is no harm in them. And if they desist, there is only for Allah. Then if they desist, then there is no blame against them.
The sacred month is for the sacred month, and the sacred month are prohibited. So if anyone who retaliate against you, then aggress against him. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is with the pious.
And spend in the way of Allah, and do not cast yourselves out with your own hands; and do good; God loves the good.
And give the Hajj, and the wayfarer. And if you are standing, then let the people-camel of Allah's way, and if you are afraid, then they are not able to be able to leave it. And if you fear a person, then, it is no expiation for him. And if you fear, then, it is prescribed for him. And when you are compelled, it is the expiation for you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is severe in retribution.
The pilgrimage is only for the pilgrimage; and whoever undertakes the pilgrimage, it is not for the pilgrimage to the pilgrimage, and to the pilgrimage, and to not commit the pilgrimage; and if you do good, Allah knows it; and the provision is better for you. So fear Me, and fear Me.
It is no blame for you on your Lord, but when you die, Arafat, and the Sacred Mosque, and remember Allah's blessing; and He has guided you to Him; and you were before before Him.
Then go away from the land, and ask forgiveness for Allah. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And when you have completed your rites, remember you remember your Lord, and remember much you remember your Lord. There is some who say, “Our Lord, give us this in this world, and in the Everlasting Life.”
And there are some who say: "Our Lord! Give us in this world in this world and in the Hereafter, and save us from the punishment of the Fire."

It is not lawful for you, so that it be not lawful for them. And if ye are lawful, it is not lawful for you. And if ye are careful, then do not be in the least. And if ye are careful, then Allah hath no knowledge of it. And if ye are careful, then Allah is the transgressors, the wrong-doers.
And if he divorces him, then she has not forbidden it, and she has married her, and if he divorces him, then they are not in the limits of Allah. And if he divorces the limits of Allah, they would not be able to maintain their houses.

He is the All-sufficient, the All-glorious.

Allah is the Protector of those who believe, He brings them out from darknesses into darkness. And those who disbelieve, those who disbelieve, they are the ones who have taken them out from darkness. They are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.

And when Abraham said to his people, “My Lord, show me the dead like the dead?" He said, "Do you not say?" He said, "Yes," he said, "He has set them up."

The semblance of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is as the grain of corn which grows seven ears, and a hundred grains; and Allah multiplies whom He wills; and Allah is Ample, Knowing.
Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, and do not follow their generosity with reminders, will be rewarded with their Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
A kind of forgiveness and forgiveness, and good charity is better than good. Allah is Self-sufficient and forbearing.
O you who have faith! Do not invalidate your charities, and let the charities, who spends his wealth, who spends his people, and do not believe in God and the Last Day. As for the likeness of a rock, it is covered with a downpour, and it has been covered with it. They will not have any power over anything. God does not guide the faithless.
And the semblance of those who spend their wealth to seek Allah's pleasure and assuring their hearts, is a likeness of a garden, and a drizzle, and the drizzle, and it yields its fruits; and if it had no heavy rain, it could have no power over it; and Allah sees what you do.
Would any one of you desire that he should bring a garden and vines, and rivers flowing beneath it rivers flow, and in it is he who gave him life and old age, and he hath given him a fire, and it is consumed for him. Thus doth Allah clarify His signs, so that you may understand.
O ye who believe! expend of the good things which ye have produced for you, and expend that which ye have produced for you, and expend not for the earth that ye should not be able to hide yourselves. And know that Allah is Rich, Praised.

It is not for you to guide the guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills; and whatever good you spend, it is good for you; and whatever you spend, you will be repaid in full of what you spend, and you will not be wronged.
They are the ones who are niggardly in the way of Allah, and they are unable to travel in the land. They do not think that they are rich in the land. They rejoice in the way of God. They will recognize them from their mark. God knows what you do.
Those who spend their wealth by night and day, secretly and publicly, and spend that their Lord will have their reward with their Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
It is no one who is unable to stand on it, and he has no authority on the earth. That is because they say, and what is forbidden to Allah, and that which is forbidden to Allah has been sent down; and it is from Allah's command; and it is not for the people who are the Fire.
Allah destroys usury and nurtures charity; and Allah does not love the ungrateful.
As for those who believe and do good works, and establish regular prayers and pay the zakat, their reward is with their Lord; and there shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
O ye who believe! Be careful of Allah, if ye are believers.

O you who have faith, when you have a journey, a number of a day, and We have established you, and among you are a witness of justice, and he who does not know him is not able to know him. And if Allah has not taught him to know, he will not have been given him. And if you are compelled, it will be for him. And if you are compelled, it will be sufficient for you. And if you are compelled, it will be sufficient for you. And if you are compelled, it will be sufficient for you. God is aware of all things.
And if you are on a journey, and not find a scribe, then be a pledge to you; and if one of you entrusts one another, let him let his trust, and let him fear his Lord; and let him not conceal the testimony, his heart is sinful; and Allah knows what you do.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Whether you disclose it or hide it, Allah will forgive you for account of what He wills, and He will forgive whom He will, and Allah is Able to do all things.
The Messenger believe in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and believe in the believers. Each of them believe in God and His angels and His Books, and they say: "We hear and we obey." They say, "We hear and we obey. Our Lord, our Lord, forgive Him, and to Him is the return.”
No soul can avail his burden, except it has done it, and when it has earned, He will have made it a burden. Our Lord will say, “Our Lord, do not have us.” And if our Lord should not say, “Our Lord, we have not taken us, but we have not been given us. Our Lord, forgive us, and forgive us; our Lord is not over us.’
Alif't.
Allah, there is no deity but He, the Living, the Great.

Our Lord, why do not make us a guide of the guidance, and make us die, and give us mercy from Your mercy. Indeed, You are the Perpetual Forgiver."
Our Lord! You shall gather mankind together wherein there is no doubt; surely Allah does not break His promise.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah. They will be the fuel of the Fire.

Allah bears witness that there is no god but He, and the angels and the witnesses. There is no god but He, the Exalted, the Wise.
Surely, the religion of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Book did not differ after it after knowledge after knowledge. And whoever disbelieves in Allah's revelations, verily Allah is swift in reckoning.
And if they argue with you, say, "I have submitted me to God." And those who have been given the Book say to them, “Have you surrendered?” If they surrendered, they are guided, and if they turn away, then they turn away from it. God is Seeing of His servants.
Those who disbelieve in God's revelations and kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those who enjoin justice among justice, kill them to the painful punishment.
Those are they whose works in this world and in the Hereafter, and they have no helpers.
Have you not seen those who have been given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God to judge between them, and they turn away from it.
That is because they say: "The Fire will not touch us for a number of days for us." And they have deluded their religion.
How will it be when We gather them together on the Day of which there is no doubt, and every soul will be paid in full what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Say, "O Allah, Master of the Kingdom, gives whom Thou wilt, and seizest whom Thou wilt, Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt; surely Thou art over everything Potent.
Thou causest the night to pass into the day, and Thou causest the day to pass into the night, and Thou bringest forth the living from the living, and Thou bringest forth the living from the dead; and Thou givest sustenance for whom Thou wilt.

Say: Obey Allah and His Messenger. If they turn away, Allah does not love the unbelievers.
Allah chose Adam, and Noah, and the Family of Abraham, and the Family of Imran.
They are one of their wives, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
And when the wife of 'Imran said, "My Lord, I have vowed to Thee in dedication that which is in my womb; so accept me. You are the All-hearing, the All-knowing.”
And when she said, she said, "My Lord, I have given birth to the girl." He said, "It is what God has given birth to the birth of Mary, and I have named her Mary, and I have named her Mary, and I commend her and her offspring from Satan.”
Her Lord graciously accepted her with her, and made her grow with a goodly growth. Whenever Zechariah entered her in the sanctuary, he found her food for her. He said, "O Mary, it is from God.” She said, “This is from God.” God provides to whomever He wills without measure.
Thereupon Zechariah prayed to his Lord, and said, "My Lord, grant me good offspring from my offspring. Indeed, You are the Listener of hearing."
Then the angels called to him in the sanctuary, saying, "God gives you glad tidings to the Word of God, and the Word, and among the righteous, and among the righteous.”
He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son when I am overtaken and my wife is barren?" He said, "God does what He wills.”
He said, “My Lord, give me a sign." He said, "Your sign is that you will not speak to three people except by gestures. Your Lord and evening and evening, and glorify Him in the evening.”
And when the angels said, "O Mary, God has chosen you and purified you and purified you above the women of the worlds.”
O Mary, worship your Lord, and bow down with those who bow down."
This is of the news of the unseen, which We reveal to you, and you were not with them when they cast lots from their pens, and when they were not present, you would not have come to them.
And when the angels said, "O Mary, God has chosen you from the Word of Him, whose name is Messiah, son of Mary, Jesus, Jesus, in this world and in the Hereafter.
And he will speak to me in the cradle and in the cradle, and he will be among the righteous.
He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son when no man has touched me?" He said, “Thus Allah creates whatever He wills, He creates whatever He wills." He creates it He wills, "Be".
And We gave him the Book and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel,
And We sent the Children of Israel with the Children of Israel. He said, "I have come to you a sign from your Lord." So, when it was, he said, “Strike your staff, and eat it, and eat of the land, and eat the flesh of God, and eat the flesh of your Lord, and eat what you used to do.”
And follow that which was before me, and that which hath been forbidden unto you of that which hath been forbidden unto you, and there hath come unto you a sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me.
Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him. This is the straight path.”
When Jesus sensed the denial of their disbelief, he said, "Who will be my helpers in God?" The disciples said, "We are God's helpers; we have faith in God, and we are the believers.”
"Our Lord, we have been sent down to the Messenger, and we follow the Messenger. Inscribe us with the witnesses."
And they plotted, and Allah planned; and Allah is the Best of planners.
And when Allah said, "O Jesus, I will take you to Myself and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve, and I will follow those who follow you with the Day of Resurrection. To Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning what you used to differ.”
As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them in this world and in the Hereafter, and there will be no helpers for them.
And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages; and Allah does not love the unjust.
This (Qur'an), We recite to you the Qur'an, and the Wise, the Wise.
The likeness of the Messiah is that of Adam, who created him, and He created him, and said, “Be,” and he was.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be of the doubters.
Then whoever disputes with you concerning that which hath come to you, say, “Come, let us call our sons and your sons, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and pray to us, and invoke the curse of Allah on the liars.”
This is the true narrative. There is no deity except Him. God is the Almighty, the Wise.
But if they turn away, then Allah knows best the mischief.
Say, "O People of the Book! Come to you a Book, and a witness between us, except that we worship none except Allah, and we associate no partner with Him.” Then if they turn away from Allah, say, “Bear your testimony, we are Muslims.”
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham when the Torah and the Gospel came to him? Do you not understand?
You are those that you have knowledge about God. Do you argue about you about which you have no knowledge? God knows and you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian, nor was he, a Hanif, and he was not one of the idolaters.
Abraham (Abraham) are among those who follow him, and those who follow him, and those who believe, and Allah is the Protector of the believers.
A party of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they lead themselves astray, but they are not aware.
O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah? And if you are witnesses?
O People of the Book! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood and hide what you hide?
And there was said to the People of the Book(saying): "Believe in what was sent down to the believers (i.e. the Quran) in the morning (i.e. the Quran), and those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and disbelieve in the Hereafter.
"And do not follow those who follow your religion." Say, "It is the guidance of Allah." And they say, "Why do you not believe?" Say, "The Hand of Allah is above you. He grants whomever He wills, and He grants whomever He wills. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
He singles out whom He will; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
And among the People of the Book are he who, if he is with you, he will restore him with it; and if there are some of them, he will not restore him with him. And if you entrust him, he will not leave it with you. That is because they say, "We have no power over the gentiles.” But they attribute lies against Allah.
Nay! Allah loves those who fulfill their covenant and fears Allah; and Allah loves those who do.
Those who sell Allah's covenant and their oaths, for a small price, they have no share in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them.
And among them is some who distort the Book with their tongues, that they may recite it to the Book, and they say: This is from Allah. They say, “This is from Allah.” And they attribute lies, and they speak lies against Allah.
It is not for any human being to whom Allah has given the Book and wisdom and prophethood, and he said to his people: "Be my servants," and he said: "Allah is my Lord, the Book."
And you would not believe in the angels and the angels, when you have surrendered to Him, then will you disbelieve?
And recall when Allah took a covenant from the prophets, “We have been given the Book, and to give you the Book, confirming what is sent to you, and he will come to you." He said, "I will then believe." And when he help him, they said, “We am with you, and I am with you.”
But whoever turns away, then they are the transgressors.
What, do they seek a religion other than Allah, and who are in the heavens and the earth, willingly, or unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned.
Say: "We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, and the Tribes, and the Tribes, and the prophets, and the prophets. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have surrendered."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, he will not be accepted, and he will be in the Hereafter, and in the Hereafter.
How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after they have believed, and they bore witness to their Messenger, and the clear signs came to them. God does not guide the unjust.
These are the ones who will be punished from Allah, and the angels, and the angels.
They will abide therein forever, nor will they be granted respite.
Except those who repent and mend their ways; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
As for those who disbelieve after their faith, after disbelief, and then increase their disbelief, will not be accepted, and they are further astray.
As for those who disbelieve, and die, and die, and die in the earth, it will not be accepted from them, nor will they be accepted from it. They will have a painful punishment.
You will not attain righteousness until you spend for the cause of Allah, and whatever you spend, and whatever you spend. God is aware of all things.
All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel had given unlawful to the Torah. Say, "Bring the Torah, if you are truthful."
Then whoever fabricates lies against Allah, it is the wrong-doers.
Say, "God has spoken the truth. Do not follow the creed of Abraham, and he was not one of the polytheists."
Indeed, the first House (of Makkah) is established for mankind, and a blessed place for the people.
In the signs there are clear signs, a clear sign. And whoever enters it, it is to enter it; and for the House is the pilgrimage to Allah. And whoever disbelieves, it is only for him. And whoever disbelieves, then Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say, "People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the signs of God? God is all-aware of what you do."
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you bar the way of the Book from Allah, seeking to make it crooked? Do you not know God? God is aware of what you do.
O you who believe! If you obey those who were given the Book, they will turn you away from your faith, and you will disbelieve.
How can you disbelieve in the signs when Allah has recited to you, and His Messenger and His Messenger? And whoever holds Allah's way, he is guided to the straight path.
O ye who believe! Be careful of duty to Allah, and do not die except for those who die.
And hold fast to the command of Allah, and be not divided. And remember Allah's blessing upon you, when He made you forget, and He made your hearts so that you were your brothers. And you were under the brink of the Fire, and He saved you. Thus Allah expoundeth to you His signs, so that you may be guided.
Let there be a group of you who invite a people to be good, and enjoin what is right. These are the successful.
And do not be like those who divided themselves after themselves had come to them, and there is a great punishment for them.
On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be blackened, and the faces of those who faces will be blackened, “Did you disbelieve? Now taste the punishment, because you disbelieved.”
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah; they will abide therein forever.
These are the verses of Allah. We recite them to you in truth; and Allah does not love the unjust.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Him all matters return.
You are the people who made the people to inherit the people, and enjoin what is right, and forbid what is right. And if you believe in Allah's guidance, it would have been better for them. But most of them are believers, and most of them are transgressors.
They will not harm you. But if they fight you, they will turn their backs, and they will not be helped.
They shall be pitched by the mosque of Allah, wherever they are stricken to a wrath of Allah. They have incurred wrath from God, and they have incurred their wrath. That is because they disbelieved in God's revelations, and the prophets slew them. That is because they disobeyed the signs of God.
They are not alike. Of the People of the Book are those who recite the revelations of Allah, and they are constant in prayer, and they are humble.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin good deeds, and forbid evil deeds, and do good deeds, and are among the righteous.
And they will not be grieved in what they did, and Allah is the best of the godfearing.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah. They are the inhabitants of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
The likeness of those who spend in this world will be likened to a freezing wind like a freezing wind, which is a likeness of a wind, which is in a state of the Fire, and they wronged themselves. And Allah does not wrong them, but they are wronging themselves.
O you who have faith! Do not take your confidants to worship other than Him, they will not spare you. They do not love you. Hatred has been their hatred. Their hatred has come to hide from their mouths. We have made the signs clear for you, if you understand.
And you are not loving to them, and you love them. And you believe in Allah's Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe.” But when they meet you, they bite their fingers in rage. Say, "Die in rage. God knows what is within the breasts.”
If good good happens to you, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls you, they rejoice at it. But if you are patient, their guile will not avail you. God encompasses what they do.
And recall when you entered your home at the morning, appointing the believers for the believers, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
And when two parties among you were settled to their affair, and Allah is their Protecting Friend; and in Allah let the believers put their trust.
God has already helped you at Badr at Badr. So fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord will reinforce you with three thousand angels?"
If you are patient, and the enemy, and the enemy, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels.
And Allah did not send it as a glad tidings for you, and to reassure your hearts. God is Mighty, Wise.
That is a section of those who disbelieve against the disbelievers, or turn them away, so they turn back.
It is no doubt to you whether He will punish them or punishes them, or will punish them.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubling and quadrupling, and fear Allah, that ye may prosper.
And fear the Fire which is prepared for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Messenger, that you may receive mercy.
And seek forgiveness from the forgiveness of your Lord and Paradise in the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.
Those who spend in charity and adversity, and those who are angry, and pardon the anger of God, and forgive them; and Allah loves the righteous.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgiveth sins, and do not know that they are wont to do.
Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent is the reward of the virtuous.
Many people have passed away before you. So travel in the land and see what was the end of the deniers.
This is a reminder for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for the Godwary.
And do not be sad, nor grieve, but if you are believers, you are believers.
If a wound has touched you, there is a similar wound for those who have gone away, so that Allah may know those who have faith, and that Allah may know those who have faith, and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may purge the believers and the unbelievers.
What, do you think that you will enter Paradise? Do not Allah know those who do not believe in the cause of God, and who are steadfast.
And you had wished to hasten before death before death, and you did not see your eyes.
Muhammad is not a messenger. Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is slain, you will turn back on your heels. And whoever turns back to his heels, Allah will not harm any harm on anyone. God will reward the thankful.
No soul can receive its Lord's decree; but whoever desires the reward of this world, We will provide it with him; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We will give him his reward; and We will reward the thankful.
And many a prophet have fought from the people who have been fought, and they fainted not in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken them, nor did they weaken themselves; and Allah loves the patient.
And they said, “Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and our excesses, and make us steadfast, and make us victory over the faithless.”
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! if you disbelieve the unbelievers, they turn you back to your heels, and you will turn back losers.
Nay! Allah is your Patron, and He is the Best of helpers.
And We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve that they have associated partners with Allah with that which He hath sent down for them. Their abode is the Fire; and the evil-doers is the Fire.
Allah has promised your promise to you, but he made you forget to make you forget in the matter, and when you disputed, you would have been disputed to lose courage. And if you were ungrateful, He will make you taste some of you, and He will make you taste that which He wants, and He will make you taste that which He wills; and He is the best of the believers.
And when you were not afraid when you did not shed a scribe, but the Messenger, and the Messenger, and he took you as a Messenger, so that you might not grieve in what you did not expect, so that you might not grieve for what you have done, and God is aware of what you do.
Then, He made you a sign, and He sent down the sea, and there was among them a party of them, and they said: "This is no more than you." They said, "We have no knowledge about it." They said, "We can have no power in it." They said, "We have no power to be in your hands." They say, "Had you have any knowledge, it would have been sent down for you.” And Allah knows what you reveal.
And those of you who turned back on the Day when the two armies met, then Satan made them forget to backslide, because of what they have earned; and Allah has forgiven them; and Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when they go forth to their brethren, when they travel in the land, or when they go forth, they say, “If they were attacked, they would not have been slain. God will cause it to life in their hearts, and He gives life and causes death. And Allah is Seeing of what you do.
And if you are killed in the way of Allah or die, and the mercy of Allah is better and mercy.
And if you are slain or are killed, then Allah will surely be gathered to you.
This is the grace of Allah to show mercy to you. Had you had been harsh and hardhearted, they would surely have been uneasy. So pardon forgiveness for them, and ask forgiveness for them. But when you consult them, then put your trust in God. God loves those who trust Him.
If Allah helps you, there can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, He will help you? And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent, but whoever defrauds will bring him on the Day of Resurrection, when every soul will be paid in full, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who has incurred the wrath of Allah, whose abode is Hell, and whose destination is Hell.
They are in ranks, and Allah is Seeing of what they do.
God has granted the believers a great favour to the believers, when He sent to them a Messenger from among them, reciting to them His verses, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom. Before they were in manifest error.
And when you had inflicted it with a great punishment, you would have inflicted twice twice twice? Say, "What is your business?” Say, “It is from your own selves. God has power over all things."
And on the day when the two armies met before the two armies, the day of which Allah might be sent down, so that He might know the believers.
And that He might know the hypocrites, and when it was said to them, "Come, fight in the way of Allah,' they said, "If we knew it, we would surely have followed you.” They will say, "We were with you.” They are nearer to unbelief because they say, and Allah knows what they hide.
They are those who say, "If they obeyed us, they would not have been slain.” Say, "If you are truthful, then, you are truthful.”
Do not think those who are killed in the way of Allah. They are alive, and they will have a provision from their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has given them from His grace, and those who have not been joined with them. They shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in Allah's grace and bounty, and Allah does not waste the believers.
Those who responded to their people, and the Messenger, and those who have done their duty to God, will have a great reward.
Those who were told to say, "There is a people who have gathered you away, so fear them." They said, "God is sufficient for us. God is the best of providers."
So they returned to Allah's grace and grace, and they followed them, but they followed the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
It is Satan who frightens you. Do not fear Me, if you are believers.
And do not grieve for those who disbelieve in the way of Allah. They will not be able to harm Allah's harm. God will not punish them in this world, and they will have a great punishment.
Indeed, those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) in the price of disbelief, Allah will not harm them in the least, and theirs will be a painful torment.
And let not the disbelievers think that they should give them respite for them; but if We give them respite, they will increase their sins, and theirs will be a torment afflictive.
It is not for Allah's cause to make you enter the believers. And if they are pure from the good of the unseen, Allah will not know you in what He wills. And believe in Allah and His Messenger, and if you believe and fear Him, you will have a great reward.
And let not those who spend that which Allah hath given them out of His bounty, it is better for them; but it is worse for them. They will be niggardly on their necks on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is aware of what you do.
Allah has heard those who say: "Allah is poor and we are rich." We will write down what they say, and their prophets martyring of the prophets, and We will say: 'Taste the punishment of the Fire."
This is because of what your hands have sent before, and Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say say, "God has promised us to do not believe until we shall not believe with him." Say, “My Messengers have come to you with clear signs." Say, "Did you have brought Messengers with clear proofs, then you have been told?”
But if they belie you, then were Messengers before you, and the Book, and the Book, and the Illuminating Book.
Every soul will taste death, and it will be no recompense on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever is removed from the Fire, he will certainly be admitted to the Fire, and he will have achieved the life of the world, and this is the enjoyment of the world.
You will surely be tested in your possessions and your lives, and those who were given the Book before you, and those who have been given the Book before you, and those who have been given the Book, and you are patient.
And when Allah made a covenant to make a covenant from the People of the Book, they would not conceal it, and it did not hide it, but they cast it behind their backs, and it took a small price for a small price.
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and do not love those who have not done themselves for themselves. They will have a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over all things.
Surely, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, there are signs for those who believe.
Those who remember Allah, standing, and sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, “Our Lord, You have not created you; so do Thou protect us from the punishment of the Fire.”
Our Lord, make us enter the Fire in the Fire; and the wrongdoers have no helpers.
Our Lord, we have heard the caller calling to faith, "Believe in your Lord. Believe, our Lord will forgive us our sins and forgive us from our sins, and make us die with the righteous.”
Our Lord, give us what You promised us with Your messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You are not patient."
Their Lord will say to his Lord, "I will not eat you with a single person, or a woman or a woman, and you have been brought to the people who have been forbidden to live, and did not drive them from the land, and they will admit them in the Gardens of which rivers flow. God will admit them with gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the reward of God."
Do not make the strutting to deceive the disbelievers in the land.
It is but a brief enjoyment; and their abode is hell, and evil is the resting place.
But those who fear their Lord, for them will be Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the reward of Allah; and with Him is the best.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and what has been sent down to them, and that which has been sent down to them, humbling their Lord, humbling a small price; these are the reward of their Lord; and Allah is swift in reckoning.
O ye who believe! Be patient and surpass your endurance, and be careful of worship, and fear Allah, that ye may prosper.
O mankind! Be wary of your Lord, who created you from a single soul, then He created it from the mate, and He created it from men and women, and women, and women. And fear Allah; and Allah is watchful over you.
And give the orphans their property, and do not substitute the good of the bad. And do not devour your property with your property; indeed it is a great sin.
And if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly to orphans, marry the women of your wives, or two other, or two other, or two other. If you do not, you will not be able to deal to deal to be equitable. That is nearer to you.
And give the women their dowries graciously, but if they forego you, eat with it with it, and eat not with it.
And do not kill those who do not give up their property for Allah has made for you a portion of Allah, and clothe them and clothe them, and speak to them with kindness.
And give the orphans until they reach the age of marriage, until they reach them, and if ye find them, their wealth is straitened, and not not let up extravagantly extravagantly, and it is not for you extravagantly. And if they give their own accord, then give him be needy. And if they give them their own accord, then take them with them; and Allah is sufficient over everything.
Men shall be given a share of what parents and his parents, and what is behind for parents, and what is given to their parents, or a share, or a little, or a little.
And when the division of the division of the orphans and the needy and the needy and the needy, provide out of them, and speak to them speak to them.
And let them fear those who have left behind their homes, if they have no offspring, so that they may be afraid. And fear Allah, and speak to them.
As for those who devour the property of the orphans, eat in their bellies, they eat their bellies, and they will enter the Fire.
He has given you daughters of your mothers, and female, and female. If two two men are given, they are two-mothers, and if you are two, he would have given birth to his parents. But if he is a child, he would have given birth to his parents, and he will have appointed his parents. But if he is a child, he will have no power over him. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
And the children of your children which ye have given you, and if there had touched them, they had given him two of their mothers, and if they had given a child, he would have given him two, and if ye are given a child, he would have taken it for him; and if they are given a child, he would have made them a thousand-place; and if they had been a child, he would have made them a thousand-place; and if they had been a child, he would have taken it for him; and if they had been a child, he will have taken a burden, and he is a child, and the All-knowing.
These are the limits. Allah who obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the supreme triumph.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresseth His limits, he will be admitted to the Fire wherein he will abide, and there will be a humiliating punishment.
And those of your women who commit lewdness, and if they testify, confine them from two witnesses, and if they testify, confine them to their houses, or Allah will not guide them for a way.
And those among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, then if they repent, then turn them away, and if they repent, then verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah accepts repentance from the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance, and then repent to Him. God will relent to them. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
And repentance is not for those who do evil deeds, and when death approaches one of them, he says: "I repent," and those who disbelieve. We have prepared a painful punishment for them.
O you who have faith! Do not marry women for women, and let not their oaths be lawful to them, so that you may be given them, unless they may give them away of what you have given them. Live with them. If you dislike them, it will be better for you, if you dislike.
And if you desire to replace a wife, then do not have a heap of gold, then do not take it back to one another, unless you do not take it back to another, and it is more a manifest calumny.
And how can ye take you back when ye have created, and they have made you a solemn covenant?
And marry not women whom your fathers married, except that which hath been decreed. That is an indecency, and evil is the evil.
You will have your wives, women, and women, and women, and women, and all hair, and women, and women, and your women, and your women, women, women, and women, your wives, and your women. And if you are truthful, they will not be weak. And if you are truthful, they will have no sin against you. God is forgiving and merciful.
And the women and the women are not one of their mothers; but Allah has appointed for you what ye have been forbidden, and that ye are forbidden to do not be forbidden to them, and do not take your property in the past, unless ye have made a means of marriage, and that ye may not be able to be blamed. Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And marry not the women, women, women, women, and women, and those who are faithful, and the women who are among you. And Allah knows you in the Book, and they are not among them. And when they give their fathers, give them not be the marriage of marriage. And if they are admonished, then they shall have no expiation. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah wants to make clear to you clear things, and to guide you from the ways of those before you. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
And Allah will forgive you to the Mercy of your Lord; and those who follow their lusts are far away from it.
Allah wants to lighten your affair, and He is created weak.
O ye who believe! Do not devour the property of your property, except for the trade of mutual consent, and do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is Most Merciful, Most Merciful.
And whoever does the wrong-deed and does wrong wrong, We will surely drive him into the Fire. That is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden, We will remove your sins, and make you enter the gate of Honor.
Do not covet what Allah has given for you some of some of others, and for others for what they have earned, and what they have earned, and for their wives; and Allah is Cognizant of everything.
And We have appointed heirs to the parents and his parents, and those who have made their covenant, and to them their share. Allah is watchful over all things.
The people of the women are those whom Allah has given some of them excel of others, and those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, and those who are careful of their wealth, and are careful for Allah; and if you obey them, they will not be able to repel them; and if you obey them, they will not be able to repel them. God is Strong, Powerful.
And if you fear a breach between the two and a woman and his wife, appoint her arbiters from his wife. If they wish to make reconciliation, Allah will unite them. God is All-knowing and All-aware.
Worship Allah, and do not associate anything with Him, and to parents, and to relatives, and to the needy, and to the needy, and to the neighbour, the neighbour, the companion, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer. God does not love the arrogant.
Those who are niggardly and enjoin others, and hide what Allah has given them of His bounty; and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, and do not believe in Allah and in the Last Day, and who have taken an evil companion, and he is an evil companion.
How were it that they believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spent what Allah has given them out of what they have spent, and Allah knows best what they spend.
Allah does not wrong any atom's weight in the least. If anyone receive a good deed, He will give it with a great reward.
How will it be when We bring a witness from every nation, and We bring you a witness from a witness?
On that Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were levelled into the earth, and they will not be able to hide God.
O you who have believed! Do not approach your prayers until you are drunk, but when you know it, do not approach the people, unless you are travelling, and if you are sick, or if you are sick, then, or, if you are sick, then, there is no blame from you, and if you find a journey, then, you will find a light, and wipe your faces. God is Pardoning and Forgiving.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, purchasing it astray, and lead you astray from the way?
Allah knows your enemies. God suffices as a protector and Helper.
And there is some of the people who have been forbidden in the way of Allah, and and make you forget, and say, "Take your mouths, and you speak with your mouths.” But if they are guided, We are made him and the Book. They have made the wrath of the disbelievers, but they do not believe.
O People of the Book! Believe in what We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW), confirming what is sent down to you, and We turn them away from their backs, and We have cursed them, and We shall curse them with the worst.
Verily Allah does not forgive association with Him, and He forgives whom He wills. And whoever ascribes partners with Allah, he is a great sin and a great sin.
Have you not considered those who claim themselves? Rather Allah purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged.
Look, how they invent a lie against Allah, and that is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who have been given a portion of the Book, saying, "They disbelieve in the Book, and who disbelieve, and the unbelievers, who are better than the believers.”
They are the ones whom Allah has cursed. Whomever Allah curses, you will have no helpers.
Or have they a share in the Kingdom? Then, when they do not give a people a speck?
Or do they envy some people that Allah has given them of His bounty? Indeed, We gave Abraham the Book, and the Book, and We gave them a great kingdom.
And of them there are some who believe in the Book, and among them are some who have gone away from it.
As for those who reject Our signs, We will soon enter the Fire, as as as as their skins, as as as as their skins, We will replace them for others. Indeed, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
As for those who believe and do good works, We will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and We shall admit them with a gate of which rivers flow, and We will admit them to the gate of Paradise.
Allah commands you to render trusts to their owners. And when you judge between the people, judge between justice with justice. God advises you. God is All-hearing and All-seeing.
O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those who are with you. If ye dispute about the matter of Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day, then believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and better.
Have you not seen those who believe that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you? They desire to worship the judgement of God, though they have not been commanded.
And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down to you, and the Messenger, when you see their faces?”
How could it be when a misfortune befalls them from their hands? Then when they come to you swearing, "We are only reformers and conciliation.”
They are the ones whose hearts Allah knows what is in their hearts. So admonish them from them and admonish them from their word.
And We sent not the messenger to follow Allah's leave. And when they had wronged themselves, they would have asked it. And when they had wronged themselves, they would have asked forgiveness for Allah and forgiveness for forgiveness for them. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
But no, by your Lord, they do not believe until they will be able to judge between them, until they judge in the matter of Allah, and that they may not find their hearts, nor will they believe.
And if We had commanded them, "Kill your homes, or your homes,' but they would not have done it. Had they had done it, they would have been better for them, but they would have been better.
And We will surely have given them from Us a great reward.
and guided them to the Straight Way.
And those who obeys Allah and His Messenger, and those whom Allah has promised, the Prophets, the martyrs, the martyrs, the martyrs, the righteous, and the righteous, and the righteous.
This is the bounty of Allah, and Allah is the All-sufficient, the All-knowing.
O you who believe! Take your precautions, and go forth in detachments, or go forth in groups.
And most of you are one who lag back. But if a misfortune befalls you, he says: 'Allah has been gracious to me."
And if a grace of Allah comes to you, he would have no affection between you, and he would say, “Oh, if I had followed me, I would certainly have been a great success."
Let those who sell the life of this world for the life of this world, and whoever fights in the way of Allah, he shall surely give him a great reward in the life of Allah, or whether he is victorious or a great reward.
How is it that you do not fight in the cause of Allah, and the oppressed men, and children, and children, "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, and appoint us from Yourself, and appoint us from Yourself from Yourself, and appoint us from Yourself.”
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah; and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Satan. So fight the friends of Satan. Indeed, the strategy of Satan is weak.
Have you not considered those who claim to worship your parents, and pay the alms, and pay the alms, and said, "Our Lord, do not have a Messenger?" So when a time befell them, he would say, “Our Lord, why, when you have been Godwary.” They will say, “Our Lord, why, we have been given us.” And they will say, “We have no faith.” And the reward of the Hereafter is not equal, and they will not be wronged.
Wherever you may go, you will be able to go forth on it. But if they are towers, they say, "This is from God.” But if some good them, they say, “This is from Allah.” But if a misfortune comes, they say, “What is the matter from Allah.”
Whatever good befalls you is from Allah, and whatever it reaches you, and We have sent you as a warner; and Allah is sufficient as a witness.
Whoever obeys the Messenger, he has obeyed him; and if they turn away, We have not sent you as a keeper.
They say, "Obedience, but when they turn away from them, there is some of them by night." But when they hide what Allah has commanded to pass, they are commanded. So turn away from them; and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee.
Do they not ponder the Qur'an? Had it been the other from Allah, they would have been settled in it.
When there comes to them a news of security or security, they would hide it. Had they referred it to the Messenger, they would have followed it. Had it not been for the grace of Allah, they would have followed it. Had not Allah's mercy upon you, you would have followed Satan.
So fight in the way of Allah, and do not be like yourself. Urge the believers, for Allah will restrain the unbelievers. God is stronger in retribution and strongest in retribution.
Whoever intercedes for a good intercession will have a share for it, and whoever intercedes for an evil deed will find it. God is watchful over all things.
And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet with a greeting with it or return to it. Allah is swift over everything.
Allah, there is no god but He. He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection, wherein is in the truth, and who is more truthful than Allah.
What is the matter with you, when you are divided about the hypocrites? God has forgiven them for their deeds. Do you want to guide God? Whomever God sends astray, you can find no way for him.
Fain, they disbelieve that you disbelieve, like the disbelievers, and do not take them for them. Do not take them to fight in the way of Allah. If they turn away, then kill them wherever you find them, and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take a guardian for them.
And fight not those who take a way between you, and among them, or to fight to fight from you, unless they fight from their religion, and to not fight their religion.

God creates whatever He wills, and He is powerful over everything.”

Then Allah sent a crow scratching on the ground, so that he might show him to the corpse of his brother. He said, "Woe to me! Am I have seen me, so that he may be the corpse of the calf?” So he was regretful.
And We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a person for a murder, or to murder it in the earth, he will be as though he had slain. And whoever saves him, he will be as though he had saved him. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, but most of them were transgressors.
Those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, and spread corruption in the land in order that they shall be able to be crucified or crucified, or their hands, or their feet, or their feet, or their feet, or their feet. Such is in this world, and in the Hereafter there is a great punishment.

And they are not aware, and some of them are in doubt. They say, "If you are truthful, you will not be able to be like." They have no knowledge in the life of the world, and they have no power of it. Those who do not have faith.
They are listeners to falsehood and devourers. If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. If they turn away from you, they cannot not harm you in the least. But if you judge, judge between them with justice. God loves the equitable.
And how can they make you judgment about the Book which has been revealed to them? And they turn away after Allah's judgement? And they are not believers.
And We have sent down the Book, a guidance, and the light, and the Christians, and the prophets, and the rabbis and the prophets, that they were commanded with Allah. So do not fear Me, and fear not for Me, and do not sell My signs for a paltry price; and do not make a few of a people who disbelieve not.
And We ordained for them in this world, a life for a eye, a nose for a nose, and a nose for a nose, and a nose for a nose, and a tooth for a tooth; and whoever forgoes it, it is a atonement for him; and whoever does not judge by what Allah has sent down, it is they who are the evildoers.

We have sent down to you the Book, the Book, confirming the Book, and the Book, and has appointed them. God has sent down to them the Book, and has not followed their desires. Do not follow their desires, nor follow their desires. Had Allah willed, He would have made you a great deal.
And judge between them by what Allah has sent down, and follow their desires; and beware of them, lest they turn away from that which Allah hath sent down to you, and if they turn away, know that Allah will punish them for their sins; and most of mankind are transgressors.
Do they seek the judgement of ignorance? And who is better than Allah who is better than the people?
O you who have faith! Do not take the Jews and the Christians, nor do they are friends. They are allies of each other. And whoever takes you is allies of them. God does not guide the unjust.

That is the bounty of God. He grants His favors to whomever He wills. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
Your Lord is the guardian of Allah and His Messenger, and those who perform the prayer and pay the alms, and bow down (in charity).
And whoever is the enemy of Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, the party of Allah is the victor.
O you who believe! Do not befriend those who have been given the Book before you, as as a sport, and sport, and play, and those who disbelieve, if you are believers.
And when they call to prayer, they take a mockery and fun a sport; because is because they are a people who do not understand.
Say, “O People of the Book, why do you make us any harm in the Book? We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and that which was sent down before us, and most of you are transgressors.”
Say, “Shall I inform you who will know the worst of God, worse than whom He has cursed them, and He has cursed them with His wrath and swine and swine and swine. These are the worst ones, and they are further astray from the right path.”
When they come to you, they say, "We believe in it, and they are in their disbelief.” God knows best what they hide.
And you see many of them hastening with sin and transgression, and consuming illicit another earnings. Evil is evil for what they do.
Do not prevent the rabbis and the priests, and consuming their consuming them, and do not prevent the unlawful. Evil is what they do.
And the Jews say, "Allah is the fourth, and their hands.” They say, "It is not for us." Rather, when they are in the least, they say, "It is only for Allah." It is only that He has sent down to you, and it has been revealed to you in the way of your Lord, and He will make them taste the Day of Resurrection, and He will make those who have faith. God loves not the corrupters.
Had only the People of the Book believed and been Godwary, We would surely have redeemed their sins, and We would admit them to the Gardens of Bliss.
And if they had followed the Torah and the Gospel, and the guidance from their Lord, they would have found them from above them, and they have made them out from above them; and most of them are evil.

Say, "O People of the Book, do not follow you until you follow the Torah, and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to you from your Lord.” That is revealed to you from your Lord, and increase them in disbelief. So do not grieve for the unbelievers.
Those who believe, and the Sabians and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do righteous deeds, shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
We made a covenant to the Children of Israel, and We sent to them messengers. And whenever a Messenger came to them, they would not speak to their hearts, but they were faithless.
They thought that they would not experience it, but they became blind and deaf, and Allah turned them to His mercy, and they were blind and deaf. God sees what they do.
Those who disbelieve say: 'Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary." They said, "Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord, and your Lord." But whoever associates with Allah, He has forbidden the Fire; and the Fire is the Fire.
Those who disbelieve say, "Allah is the third of three people." There is no deity but He. But if they desist not, they should have a painful punishment.
Do they not turn back to Allah and ask forgiveness for forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was nothing but a messenger, passed away before him. And he was his mother, and his mother, and they ate food. Look, how We paraphrase the signs, so they see it.
Say, "Do you worship that Allah has no power to benefit or benefit you? God is All-hearing and All-knowing."
Say, "O People of the Book, do not follow your religion in the way of God, and do not follow the desires of the people who were led astray, and they have gone astray, and strayed from the right path.”
Cursed of the Children of Israel, who disbelieved, and Jesus, and Jesus, Jesus, the son of Mary, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed.
And they did not prevent them from one another. Evil was what they used to do.
Thou seest many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is what they have been sent before them. God's wrath is upon them, and they will abide in the torment of Hell.
And if they had believed in Allah and the Messenger and that which was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as allies, but most of them are believers.
You will find the Jews, the Jews, the Jews, the believers among the believers, and those who believe, “We are Christians.” That is because they say, “We are Christians.” That is because some of them are priests and monks.
And when they hear what hath been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears with their eyes. They say, “Our Lord, we believe, so write us with the witnesses.”
And why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? Our Lord will admit us from the righteous of the righteous.”
Allah will reward them with gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever forever. That is the reward of the virtuous.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the dwellers of the Fire.
O you who have faith! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. God does not love the transgressors.
Eat of what Allah has provided for you and good good things, and fear Allah, and be careful of Him.
It is not for you that ye should not be able to be weak, but do not be afraid of one another. And when you give up to them, He will not give you up to life, nor do not give any one of them. And if you are able to do, it is not to be able to be a thousand months. Thus Allah completes His commandments to you, that you may be grateful.
O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling and gambling, and divining arrows are abominations; and shun the abomination of Satan, so that ye may prosper.

Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. If you turn away, know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey you.
Those who believe and do good works, they shall not be blamed for what they have eaten, and do good deeds, and believe, and believe, and believe, and believe, and believe, and Allah loves those who do good. God loves the pious.
O ye who believe! Allah knoweth you with the game of which ye hide, and that Allah may know that Allah will know who fears Him. And whosoever transgresses after him, there is a painful torment for him.
O ye who believe! Do not be in the state of a game, and ye have made your hands, and ye have forbidden it. And if he hath forbidden a like of that which hath been forbidden for you, there shall be a means of one for you, and he is a means of a slave, and he is a means of the poor, and he who retaliates for his own soul; then Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
Lawful to you is the game of the sea and the sea, and the game for you, and the game for the travellers, and the game that ye are forbidden. And fear Allah, unto whom you will be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka-bah, the Sacred House, the Sacred month, the Sacred month, and the necklaces, and the garlands, and the garlands, and the garlands, so that you may know that God knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and that you may know.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger (Muhammad SAW) is only to convey the message, and Allah knows what you conceal and what you reveal.
Say: "The good and the good are not equal, even though the abundance of the corrupt attract you. So fear Allah, so that you may prosper.
O you who have faith! Do not ask about things about which God has revealed to you, if it is clear to you. If you speak to them, they will have been sent down to you. God is forgiving and kind.
A people before you asked questions, and they turned away in it.
Allah has not forbidden the superstitions of Bahirah, nor sa, nor sa, nor sa, or wasilah or ham. They disbelieve in Allah, and most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," they say, "We found our fathers following us.” Even though their fathers had no knowledge, nor are they guided.
O you who have faith! Do not befriend your own souls. If you are guided, it will be no harm for you, and you will be returned to Him, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
O ye who believe! When ye take a part of a man, he will be two two of you, and if one of you die, then ye are mightier than you. And if ye are in the land, then then ye will be able to offer up their religion. And if they are to be able to worship, then they will be in the least. And we shall surely be drowned the guilty.
But if it is discovered that the two one of the guilty of the two-doers has been guilty, then two of the two of the two-doers, let two of them leave their testimony, and they swear by Allah, "Our testimony is truer than the testimony of the truth, and we do not think that we should be wrongdoers."
That is likelier that they speak to the truth, so that they may bear their oaths or their oaths. So fear Allah, and be careful. And Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
On the Day when Allah will gather them together, He will say, "What did you say?" They say, “We have no knowledge.” He is the Knower of the unseen.
And when Allah's son said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, and remember I gave you to the son of the heavens and the earth, and to make you a mount of the mountain." And when He brought to you the Book, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, the Torah, and the Gospel.
And when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and My apostle, they said: "We believe, and bear witness to us."
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord able to send down upon us a repast from heaven?" He said, "Fear fear of God, if you are believers.”
They said, "We wish that we should eat and our hearts, and that you may know the truth, and we have been sent to the truth.”
Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O Allah, our Lord, send down down to us a table from heaven, that it may be a festival from us, and the last of us, and a sign, and provide us for the people of the world, and provide us for sustenance.”
Allah said: "I am sent down to you. But if you have any knowledge, I will punish him, and I will punish him with a great punishment."
And when Allah said, "O Jesus, the son of Mary is the son of Mary? Why do you not believe?" He said, “What, do you have faith me?" He said, "I have no knowledge about me.” Say, "I have no knowledge of what you have done. You know what you do not know. You know what you do not know. You know the unseen.
I did not say to them except that I commanded them, "Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." But I watched them as a witness over them; and when Thou tookest me, they Yourself would have watched them. Thou art over them, over all things.
If You punish them, they are Your servants; and if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say, “This is the Day when the truthful will benefit for their truthfulness. For them there will be gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. God is pleased with them and they will be pleased with Him. That is the supreme triumph."
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them; and He is Able to do all things.
All praise is to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light. And those who disbelieve equalise their Lord.
It is He Who created you from clay, then then decreed a term, and appointed a term for you. Then you are in doubt.
He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you do.
And there comes to them a sign from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
Indeed, it has come to them the truth when it has come to them, and they will soon learn the consequences of what they used to ridicule.
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, who did not established you in the earth, and We established you in the earth, and We sent down upon them the rain of heaven, and made them rivers flow beneath them. So We destroyed them for their sins.
And if We sent down to you a Book from paper, they would have touched it with their hands. The unbelievers say: "This is nothing but plain magic."
And they say, “Why has not an angel been sent down to him?” Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have been settled, and they would not have been reprieved.
And if We sent him a angel, We would have made him a man, and they would have been confused in their doubt.
Messengers were mocked before you, but those who scoffed at them were enveloped by what they scoffed.
Say: Travel in the land and see how was the end of the rejecters.
Say: 'To whom belongs the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To Allah. He has mercy for Himself. On the Day of Resurrection, He will gather you all together. Those who lost themselves will not believe.
And to Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day; and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Say: 'Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, who feeds for Him, Who feeds and gives me sustenance." Say, "I have been commanded to be the first, and I am not one of the idolaters.”
Say, "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of the Great Day.”
On that Day, the punishment will be averted from him, His mercy is upon him. That is the supreme triumph.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, none can remove it except Him. And if He touches you, He is Able to do all things.
He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise, the Wise.
And they say, "The best is better.” Say, "The witness is only with Allah, and it has been sent down to you, and it is revealed to you, and you will have sent down the Book.” Say, "God is the One, there is no god but He.” Say, "I do not witness anything except God." Say, "I do not witness anything.”
Those to whom We have given the Book recognise it as they recognize their sons. Those who have lost themselves will not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies His signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.
On the Day when We gather them together, We will say to those who ascribed partners to Allah, “Where are the associates whom you claimed to worship?"
Then they will not say, "God's Lord worshipped us. We have not been associated to worship."
Look, how they lie to the lie, and what they used to fabricate themselves will vanish against them.
Among them are some who listen to you, and We have set veils over their hearts, and heaviness, and heaviness, and heaviness, even though they see the sign, they would not believe in it. And if they come to you, they say, “This is nothing but stories of the ancients.”
And they turn away from it, and they turn away from it, and they do not save except themselves.
And if you could see when they will be raised before the Fire, and they will say: "Would that we had been sent back, and we would not reject the signs of our Lord."
Nay, but what they used to hide will come to them; and if they had been returned to, they would surely have been forbidden, and they are liars.
And they say, “There is nothing but the life of this world, and we shall not be raised up (to life]."
If you could see when they will stand before their Lord. He will say, "Is it not the truth?" They will say, “Yes, by our Lord.” He will say, “Taste the punishment for your disbelief."
Those who deny the meeting with Allah, they will certainly be losers. When the Hour overtakes them suddenly, they say, "Alas for us! Alas, we will bear their backs on the Day of Resurrection, and their backs will bear their backs. Evil is what they did.”
The life of this world is nothing but a sport and a pastime; and those who are Godwary is better for the Godwary. Will you not understand?
We know what they say to you. But they do not say, but they deny the revelations of Allah.
Messengers before you were rejected, and they were patient, and they were patient until Our help came to them. There is none who can alter the words of God. And there has come to you the news of the Messengers.
And if their aversion is distressful for you, then if you seek a tunnel to the earth, or bring a tunnel to them, or bring them a sign to bring them. Had Allah willed, He would have made them all guidance. So do not be of the ignorant.
Only those who listen to the truth, and who are the dead. God will resurrect the Day of Resurrection.
And they say, “Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “God is Able to send down the sign, but most of them do not know.”
And there is not a animal that crawls on the earth, nor bird its wings, and are communities like you. We have no knowledge in the Book, and they will be brought back to their Lord.
Those who reject Our signs are deaf and dumb in the darkness of darkness. God leads astray whomever He wills, and He guides whom He wills.
Say, “Have you considered? If God's punishment comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, you would call upon Him other than Him?”
In fact, they call upon Him, if He wills, and He will call you away from Him, and you associate partners with Him.
And certainly We sent Messengers before you, and We seized them with distress and adversity, so that they might humble themselves.
But why did they not submit when Our punishment came to them? Their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their deeds seem decorous to them.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded, We opened them for the extent of what they had been given, and when they were given to see what they were given, We seized them suddenly.
So the roots of those who were unjust were destroyed, and they are commanded to be praised.
Say, “Have you considered, if God took your hearing and your hearts, and set your hearts in the hearts, and He has set it down?” Look, how We paraphrase the signs, so they turn away.
Say, “Have you considered that if God's punishment comes upon you suddenly or openly, would you be destroyed?”
And We have sent the Prophet of the Prophet of the Prophet and a warner. So those who believe and do righteous deeds shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
As for those who deny Our signs, they will suffer the consequences of the sinners.
Say, "I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you, "I am only a warner." Say, "I am only the blind and the seeing.” Will you not then reflect?
And warn those who fear their Lord, that they may have no protector or intercessor besides Him, and they will have no protector or intercessor.
Do not turn away from those who invoke their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Countenance. You are not accountable for them. You are not accountable for them, nor do you turn away from them.
And We have made some of them some of others, because they say: "Are these the people whom Allah has favored us?" Does Allah not know the appreciative?
When those who believe in Our signs come to you, say, "Peace be upon you. Your Lord has mercy for you. So whoever does evil deeds, then repents, and then repents repents, then He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Thus do We explain Our signs, so that the criminals may be warned.
Say, "Have you call to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah, say, "I do not follow your desires. I would have been guided, and I will not be guided.”
Say, "I have been sent to my Lord, and you deny it. You have no power to change you in what you have no power. The decision is only with God. He is the Best of deciders."
Say, "If I seek to hasten for you, it would have been settled between me and me." God knows best the wrongdoers.
To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He knows all that is in the earth and the sea, and He knows the earth, and there is no leaf on it, but there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, and there is not a grain in the heavens and the earth.
It is He Who recalls you by night, and He knows what you earn, and He raises you to die, then He raises you to die. Then to Him you will return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
He is He Who prevails over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, and when death comes to you, Our messengers give him, and they do not hear.
Then they will be returned to Allah, their Lord. His is the judgment, and He is the swiftest of reckoners.
Say: "Who rescues you from the land and the sea, when you call upon Him humbly and privately?" Say, "If we save us from this, we will surely be among the thankful.”
Say, "It is Allah Who delivers you from every distress and from every distress, and you associate partners with Him.”
Say, “It is He Who has sent down upon you from your hands, or from beneath them from the sky, or to make you taste one another factions, and make you taste one another. Look how We explain the signs, so that they may understand.
And the people of your people is the truth. Say: "I am not a keeper over you."
Every soul is a finality, and you will know.
And when you see those who listen to Our signs, turn away from them until they engage to dispute with them. But if Satan had made you forget to forget you, then do not be unjust.
And those who fear (the duty of Allah), for them there is no doubt for them, so that they may fear (Allah).
And let the people who have made their religion a diversion and a pastime, and the life of this world, the life of this world, so that he may warn them for a Day of Resurrection. And if he had no protector, they will have no protector, nor will they have any guardian besides Him, and it is not for those who disbelieve. They will have a painful punishment.
Say, "Shall I not take any one from Allah, or will have no power to harm it, nor will we harm it? If Allah delivers us, we would have turned away from you, so that you might turn away from us.” Say, "The way of the Book is only upon the right.” Say, “It is only a guide of the right path.”
And to establish prayer, and fear Him; and it is He who is the Day of Resurrection.
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth with truth. And the Day when He will say, “Be," and it is. His Word is the truth, and on the Day when the trumpet is blown; and He is the All-wise, the All-wise.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols as gods? I see you and your people in error."
And We gave him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be among the believers.
Then when the night covered upon him, he saw a star. He said, “This is my Lord." And when it set, he said, “I do not love the ignorant.”
Then, when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord.” But when it set, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I would surely be among the erring.”
When he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, “O my people, I am quit of what you associate with God.”
Indeed, I have turned to my Lord the One Who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the idolaters.
And his people argued to him. He said, "Do you dispute with me about Allah? He has guided me to me, and I do not fear Him. My Lord embraces best all things. Will you not reflect?
And why should I fear what ye associate with Allah, and do not fear you with that which He hath sent down to you? What then is the two parties, if ye know?
Those who believe and do not believe in the way of Allah, for them are security, and they are rightly guided.
This is Our argument which We gave to Abraham his people. We raise them in degrees. Your Lord is All-wise and All-knowing.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and We guided them, and We gave them the Book, and his descendants, and Ayyub, and Ayyub, and Moses, and Aaron. Thus do We reward the virtuous.
And Zachariah, and John, and Elias, and Elias was one of them.
And Ishmael, Elisha, and Jonah, and Lot, and Lot, and each of them We gave the worlds.
And of their fathers and their progeny, and their brethren, and We chose them, and We guided them to a straight path.
Such is the guidance of Allah, whom He guideth whomsoever He will; and if they had associated partners to Him, they would have been destroyed.
They are the ones of whom We gave the Book and the wisdom, and the Prophethood. And if they disbelieve not in it, We have made a sign for mankind, and they will not deny it.
They are those whom Allah has guided. Say, "I do not ask any fee for you. It is only a reminder for the worlds."
And they do not say to Allah that they say, "He has not sent down a Book." Say, "The Book has sent down to you, who has made it a Book, and He has made it a guidance.” And if you have knowledge, He could have made it clear to you, and you have no knowledge.
And this is the Book which We have sent down, confirming that which was sent down before it, so that you may warn the people of the Mother of Cities and those who believe in it, and those who believe in the Hereafter, and they are constant.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or has been revealed to me, and has been sent down to you, or is a angel? Say, "Has Allah sent down down the Book?" But if you see it, they will say, “Today, when you were unjust, it will be your faces.” Then you will suffer the punishment for the faithless.
And indeed We have come to you, (O Muhammad], to Us We created you, and We have made you all that you have been given. We do not see any intercessors with you, and you claimed those whom you claimed besides God. Indeed, you were your associates.
It is Allah who causes the grain and the date-stone, and brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the living from the dead. Such is Allah; then how are you perverted?
It is He Who causes the night, and causes the night for the day, and the sun and the moon for calculation. He is the Mighty, the Knower.
And it is He Who made the stars for you, so that you may find it in the darkness of the land and the sea. We have explained the signs for people who have knowledge.
And it is He Who created you from a single soul, then made it a resting place and a resting place. We have explained the signs for people who have knowledge.
It is He Who sends down water from the sky, and therewith We produce it with the earth, and We produce it with the kind of grain, and We produce it with clusters of clusters, and olives, and olives, and olives, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates. Surely herein are signs for people who believe.
And they have created the jinn and the idolaters, and He created them, and they impute to their sons, and daughters, and daughters. Exalted is He above all that they ascribe to Him.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He has no consort, and He has created all things. He has knowledge of all things.
Such is Allah, your Lord, there is no god but He. So worship Him, and worship Him. He is the Guardian over all things.
No eyes can grasp Him, and He perceives it. He is the Subtle, the Wise.
Indeed, there has come to you from your Lord." So whoever sees it, it is for his own good, and whoever goes blind, it is only for him, and I am not a guardian over you.
Thus are how We paraphrase the signs, that they may say, "You have studied," so that they may know it.
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord. There is no god but He. So turn away from the idolaters.
Had Allah had willed, they would not have associated anything other than Him. We have not made you a watcher over them.
Do not insult those whom they invoke besides Allah, lest they are disrespectful on ignorance. Thus We have made every nation seem decorous to them, and their Lord will inform them of their deeds, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swear by Allah by their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they will surely believe in it. Say: 'Signs are with Allah. How can you make it clear?"
And We will remove their hearts and their eyes, as they did not believe in the first instance, but We will leave them in their insolence, and We will wander blindly in their transgression.
And if We sent down to them the angels, and the dead, and all things, We would have gathered them together. Had they not believe, they would not have believed. But most of them are ignorant.
And thus have We made every enemy to mankind from among mankind and jinn, and among the jinn, inspiring their speech. Had your Lord willed, they would not have done it. So leave them with their fabrications, and they will be forging.
And those who do not believe in the Hereafter, hearts, and their hearts may be satisfied, and that they are wont to do.
Say, “Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, when it is He Who has sent down to you the Book?" Those who gave the Book know that it is revealed from your Lord. So do not be the doubters.
And the Word of your Lord is the truth and justice and justice. There is none from Him, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
And if you were in the majority of those who were given the earth say, "You follow you from the way of God.” They follow nothing but assumptions.
Your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His way, and He knows best those who are guided.
So eat of that which Allah hath mentioned, and that ye believe in Allah's Name.
And why do you not eat that which has been forbidden to you in the name of Allah, when He has forbidden for you what He has forbidden to you? You are led astray from their own desires. Your Lord knows best the transgressors.
And abandon the sin and sin and sin. Those who commit evil will be recompensed for what they used to earn.
And do not eat that which is in the name of Allah has not been forbidden, for it is an abomination; and the devils inspire their friends with you; if you obey them, you are idolaters.
Is he who was dead, and We gave him life, and We have made him a light of which he walks to the people, who can not bring him out from it? Thus are the recompense of those who disbelieve.
And We have made every city in every city to be a trial of people, so that they may commit corruption in the land, and they do not know themselves except themselves.
When there comes to them a sign, they say, "We will not believe in it until we do not believe in God." God knows best what He has given to His servants, and they will suffer the punishment of a severe punishment.
Whomever Allah desires to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and He sends astray to whomever He wills, and He leaves his breast upon him, as if he were climbing to the sky. Thus God lays the abomination of those who do not believe.
This is the straight path of your Lord. We have made the signs clear for people who believe.
Their reward will be the Lord of their Lord, and He will be their Protector.
On the Day when He will gather them all together, He will say: "Company of jinn, and many men have made you." And among those among them who say, “Our Lord, we have profited us from a single term." He will say, "Your Lord, the Fire, the Fire.” He will say, “Your Lord is the Fire, the All Knowing.”
Thus do We make those who do wrong in the way of Allah, because they are debauchers.
O ye assembly of jinn and mankind! Came there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My signs and warning you of the encounter of this day? They will say: We bear witness against ourselves; this is the life of the world, and they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.
That is because your Lord would not destroy the cities unjustly, and they are unaware of their ignorance.
For them is degrees for what they have done. Your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
Your Lord is the All-sufficient, the All-merciful. If He willed, He will have made you successors, and He will raise you out of another people, and He will raise you from the people of the seed.
Indeed, you will know that which you have promised, and you will not escape.
Say, "O my people, work according to your ability, and I am acting. Soon you will know who will come to know in the Hereafter. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.
And of the cattle, they have created the animals of Allah, and the cattle, they say, "This is Allah," and they say, “This is Allah, our Lord, and associates is not with Him.” And their associates is with Allah, and they are not accountable.
Thus of the idolaters, their associates have made the children of the children of their Lord, so that they would destroy them, and their religion would be made them. But Allah had willed, “Had Allah had willed, they would not have taken it. So leave them with what they fabricate.”
And they say, "We eat the cattle, and cattle, and cattle, except that we do not eat.” cattle, cattle, cattle, cattle, and cattle, cattle, and cattle, they attribute lies to God. They will inform them with God, and they will be questioned.
And they say: "Whatever of the cattle is in cattle and cattle, and our wives are forbidden for us." But if they had referred it, they will have no share in it. He will requite them for their sins. God is All-knowing and All-knowing.
Those who have been given their own foolishly without knowledge, without knowledge, without knowledge, and forbid what Allah has provided for them, inventing lies against Allah. Indeed, they have lost the truth.
It is He who produces gardens and date-trees, and dates, and dates, and olives, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and the day of which they harvest, and do not waste the measure, and do not waste the wasteful.
And of the cattle, some of beasts and beasts, and eat of the cattle. Eat of God and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is your open enemy.
(They are] eight mates of pairs, and two of goats. Say, "Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me, if you are truthful."
And two of the camels, and two the pair, and two of them. Say, "Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females, or the two females? Or when Allah enjoined you?" And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah? God does not guide the unjust.
Say, "I have no knowledge to eat that I have been forbidden to eat it, except carrion, pork, pork, pork, the flesh of swine, the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine.” But whoever is constrained with necessity, not desiring it, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And to the Jews, We forbade the Jews, and the fat of the sheep, and the fat of them, and the fat of them, and the entrails, and their backs, and their backs, and their backs. We made them taste their sins, and We are truthful.
But if they belie you, say, "Your Lord is the Lord of Vast mercy, and none will not be averted from the sinners."
And the idolaters say, “Had Allah willed, we would not have associated anything besides Him, nor we nor our fathers, nor we have forbidden us.” Thus they were before them. Say, “You bring you a clear proof.” Say, "You have no knowledge to bring us, but you are only guessing.”
Say: 'The Book is the command of Allah. Had He willed, He would have guided you all."
Say, "Bring the witnesses that they testify to Allah, and what they testify, do not testify with them, nor do they follow the word of those who deny Our signs, and who do not believe in the Hereafter, and who equate their Lord.
Say, "God has forbidden your Lord, when you speak to Him. Do not associate anything with Him, and do not kill your children, and do not kill your children. Do not kill your children. Do not kill your children, and do not take your blood. This is God's blessing for you, and what you do not know.”
And do not approach the property of the orphan unless he may be in full age, and give full measure, and weigh with justice and weight with justice. We do not burden any soul except by the capacity. And when you speak, then, it is nearer to you. And fulfill Allah, you may reflect.
And that it is my way, straight straight; so follow it, and do not follow the paths of those who lead you away from His way. That is the command of Allah, so that you may be Godwary.
Then We gave Moses the Book, completing the benediction of his Lord, and made everything a Book and a mercy, that they may believe in their Lord.
This is a Book which We have sent down, so follow it, and be cautious.
(Muhammad), you said, "We have been sent down to the two groups before the two groups, and we were unaware of the ignorant.”
Or lest it should say, “Had the Book been sent down to us, we would surely have been guided.” Say, “Indeed, there has come to you from your Lord, and guidance and mercy, and who is more unjust than one who denies the signs of God?" Then they will requite him from the signs of Allah, because they turn away from Our signs.
Do they not wait for the angels, or the angels come to them, or your Lord's signs comes to you? And when the Day of Resurrection, he will not avail it for a people who have no faith, unless he does not believe in it. Say, "Wait, then, we are waiting.”
Indeed, those who divided their religion and became divided into sects, there is no concern of them. Their affair is only to Allah, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
Whoever does a good deed will have ten like it; and whoever does evil, it will be no equivalent to it, and they will not be wronged.
Say, "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, inclining to the creed of Abraham, inclining to the creed of Abraham, and he was not one of the polytheists.”
Say, "My prayer and my sacrifice, and my life, and my dying, my Lord, the Lord of the Universe.
There is no partner; and I have been commanded to be the first, and I am the first of those who submit."
Say: "Shall I seek a lord other than Allah? He is the Lord of all things. Every bearer of the soul, and no bearer of burdens, and no bearer of burden. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning what you used to differ.
And He it is Who hath made you successors on the earth, and We have made you excel above others in rank of which He hath given you. Lo! thy Lord is swift in retribution, and He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Alif't.
This is the Book which We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW), so that it may be no impediment for it, and it is not a reminder for those who believe.
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow anyone besides Him. Little little you remember.
And how many a city We have destroyed, and Our punishment came upon them, or they were at the morning.
And when Our punishment came to them, they said, "We did not wrong anyone."
Then We shall surely question those who sent Our messengers to the Messengers.
We shall narrate them with the knowledge, and We are not absent.
And on the Day when the weighing is light; and those whose scales weigh heavy in the scales, it is they who are the successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, they are the ones who have lost their souls, because they used to deny Our signs.
And indeed We have established you in the earth, and made for you a livelihood of livelihood. Little thanks ye thanks.
And indeed We created you, then We shaped you, then We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam," and they prostrated themselves, except Iblis. He was not one of those who prostrated.
He said, “What prevented you, when I commanded you?" He said, "I am better than him. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay.”
He said, “Get down from it. Do not go out in your pride. Begone, you are too.”
He said, “Give me respite until the Day of Resurrection.”
He said, “You are granted the reprieved.”
He said: "Because You have led me astray, I will waylay me on a straight path."
Then I will come to them from them and from behind them from their right, and from their right, and from their right, and you will not find any mercy.
He said, "Get out from here, despised and expelled. I will fill Hell with those who follow them."
"O Adam, dwell and dwell in your garden, and eat from it wherever you eat, but do not approach this tree, lest you are wrongdoers.”
Then Satan whispered to them with what they reveal to them, and said to them: "Your Lord has forbidden you from tree, lest you become angels or angels."
And he swore to them, "Indeed, I am your honest adviser."
Then he caused them with deceit. Then when they tasted the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to cover themselves from the leaves of the Garden. Their Lord called to them, "Did I not forbid you, and did you not know that Satan is an open enemy?"
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will surely be among the losers."
He said, "Get down, one of you, one another. And you will have your dwelling place in the land, and for a time for the time.
He said, “Therein you will live, and there will be, and you will be brought forth from it.”
O Children of Adam! We have sent down to you clothing to cover your nakedness, and feathers, and the raiment of piety. That is better for the people who reflect.
O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan tempt you as he expelled your parents, stripping your parents, stripping them from their garments, stripping them to expose them their nakedness. He and his tribe will see you, and they are the guardian of those who do not believe.
And when they commit an indecency, they say, "We found our fathers doing our fathers." Say, “God does not command His commands, and you do not know?”
Say, "My Lord has commanded justice, and when you call upon Him, turn your faces towards Him, and dedicate your religion to Him. He originated you, and you will return.”
He has guided guidance, and he has been guided. They have made the devils patrons for the devils, and they are rightly guided.
O Children of Adam! Let your adornment adornment and drink, and eat and drink, and do not waste the wasteful.
Say, “Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the good things?” Say, “These are the enjoyment of this world, and the Day of Resurrection.” Thus are how We explain Our signs for a people who know.
Say, "My Lord has forbidden indecencies, and what is apparent, and what is apparent, and sin, and oppression, and oppression, and what you associate to associate with God, and that you do not know God."
For every nation there is a term appointed, and when their term comes, they can not delay it nor advance it.
O Children of Adam! O Children of Adam! When there come to you apostles from among you relating to you, relating to you those who fear Him, and they fear no fear, nor shall they grieve.
But those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or denies His signs? Or shall they be given a portion of the Book, until Our messengers come to them, saying, “Where are you whom you invoke besides?” They will say, "We have forsaken us.” They will testify, "We have forsaken us.”
He will say, ‘Enter the Fire, the Fire of which you passed away before the jinn, and the people who passed away before them." Every one among them will say, “Our Lord, we led us astray." Then will they say, “Our Lord, we have led us astray." He will say, “There is a double punishment.”
And the first among them will say to the last of them: "You have no power over us. So taste what you used to do."
As for those who deny Our revelations and are arrogant to them, the gates of heaven shall not be opened to them, nor will they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the earth. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.
For them is a bed, and over them coverings. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.
As for those who believe and do good works, We shall not impose any soul on its capacity. These are the inhabitants of Paradise, they will abide therein forever.
We shall strip their hearts from their hearts, and will be admitted to gardens beneath them. They will say, "All praise belongs to Allah, who has guided us to the Right Way. Had Allah not guided us, we would not have guided it. Our Lord's messengers has come to the truth."
And the dwellers of the Fire will call out to the dwellers of the Fire, “We found our promise to us." Did they not say, "We have found you." They will say, “Yes," and the Caller will say, “It is not the same.” And Allah has cursed the wrongdoers.
Who bar others from the way of Allah, and seek to make it crooked crooked, and they are not believers.
And between them is a veil, and on the heights, there will be among them people, and they will say to their people, "Peace be to you.” They will say, “Peace be to you; they have not entered them, and they are joyful.”
