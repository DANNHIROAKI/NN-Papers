Allah does not forbid a parable of a gnat, but it is not a parable of a gnat, but it is not a word to be ashamed of the truth of their Lord, and those who disbelieve say, "This is what Allah has made many for you, and He has made many of them many of the truth, and He has made many of them many of whom He has made many of them, and He has made many of them many astray."
