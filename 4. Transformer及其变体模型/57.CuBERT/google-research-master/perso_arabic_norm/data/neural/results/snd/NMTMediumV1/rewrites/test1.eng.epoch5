The Beneficent God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Judgment,
We worship Thee, and we ask for help.
Show us the right path.
The path of those on whom You have favoured Your Grace, not of those who have gone astray, nor of those who go astray.
Alif Lam Mim.
“This is the Book of the Book, wherein there is no doubt, for those who fear Allah.”
Who believe in the unseen, and establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and they are certain of the Hereafter.
Those are on the right path from their Lord, and it is they who are the successful.
As for those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a covering, and theirs is a painful punishment.
And of the people are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers.
They deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, and they do not perceive.
There is a disease in their hearts, but Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them: "Make not mischief on the earth," they say: "We are only peacemakers."
Indeed, they are the earth, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Believe as the people have believed," they say: "Shall we believe as the fools believe?" They say: "Shall we believe as the fools have believed?"
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe"; but when they are alone with their Shayatin (devils), they say: "We are with you; we are indeed mocking."
God mocks them, and they will be in their rebellion in their rebellion.
Those are the ones who have purchased guidance for their guidance, so their transaction has no profit, nor did they be guided.
Their parable is like the parable of a man who kindled a fire; then when the fire came to pass, Allah took away from them their light and left them in darkness.
Deaf, dumb, blind, they will not return.
Or as it is like the sky, darkness, darkness, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, and lightning. God encompasses the disbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away from their eyes, but when they are covered by darkness, they fall down in it, and when they fall down, they stand therein. And if Allah wills, they would be fixed. And if Allah wills, He would have made their hearing their hearing and their hearing. Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord who created you and those who were before you, so that you may become righteous.
Who has made the earth a bed for you, and the sky a canopy, and the sky, and the sky, and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth therewith fruits for you; then do not set up rivals to Allah.
And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.
And if you do not, and you will not be able to do it, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous good deeds, that they may be Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will be given a fruit of which they have been given. They will say, "This is what we have been given before." And they will be brought forth, and they will be brought forth, and they will be given themselves.
God is not ashamed of the parable of the gnat, nor of the gnat; but those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord; and those who disbelieve say, "This is what Allah has revealed to you." And those who disbelieve say: "This is what is in this Qur'an, and some of them will lead astray."
“Those who break the covenant of Allah after they break it, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and make mischief in the land; these are the losers.”
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will cause you to die, then to Him you will be returned?
He it is Who has created for you all that is in the earth; then He has made the heavens to be comprehended, then He made them seven heavens, and He has knowledge of all things.
And when your Lord said to the angels, "I am going to make a vicegerent on earth," they said, "Will you make it one who will make mischief in it, and shed blood, and shed blood, and sanctify Your name?" He said, "I know what you do not know."
And He taught Adam all the names of all things, then He showed them to the angels and said, "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful."
They said: "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us; You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." And when they said to them, "Did you not say to them, ‘Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and I know that I am the Knower of the heavens and the earth?'
And when We said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam," they prostrated themselves except Iblis (Satan), they refused to prostrate themselves.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden of Eden, and eat of the fruit of which ye eat; but approach not this tree, lest ye be of the unjust.
Then Satan made the devil slip and caused them to go out of their midst, and said: "Go forth from the land," and We said: "Go forth from the land, that ye may be enemies of each other."
Then Adam learnt from his Lord a word from his Lord, so He turned towards him; surely He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
We said, "Go forth from all of you, all of you; then if there comes to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve."
And those who disbelieve not in the Oneness of Allah, they are the dwellers of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and fulfil My covenant with Me, and I will fulfill your covenant with you, and fear Me.
And believe in what I have revealed to you, confirming that which is with you, and do not be first to disbelieve therein, and do not exchange My signs for a small price; and fear Me alone.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor do you know the truth.
And establish prayer, and pay the poor-rate, and bow with those who bow down.
So do you enjoin the people with good deeds, and do you forget what you are commanded?
And seek help in patience and prayer; and it is difficult except for the humbly submissive (to Allah).
Those who think that they will meet their Lord, and to Him will they return.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to the worlds.
And fear a Day when no soul will be able to avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And remember when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with severe torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women; and there was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We made the sea the sea for you, and We saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh.
And when We took Moses forty nights for forty nights, then you took the calf after him, and you were unjust.
Then We pardoned you, so that you may be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion that you may be guided.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by the calf, so that you may turn to your Lord, so that you may kill your Lord, and kill yourselves. He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful."
And (remember) when you said: "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly, so the thunderbolt overtook you while you see."
Then We raised you up after death, that you may be grateful.
And We sent down upon you the clouds, and sent down to you manna and quails, saying, "Eat of the good things which We have provided you." And they wronged Us not, but they wronged themselves.
And when We said, "Enter this town, and eat from it wherever you eat, and enter the gate, and say: ‘Forgive us your sins,' and say, "We will forgive you your sins, and do good for the good."
And those who were unjust to the wrong-doers said to them, "This is the word of those who have wronged them, and We send down upon them a plague from heaven from heaven."
And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said: Strike your staff with your staff, then gushed forth from the rock; then gushed forth from each people, and every people may drink from their drinking. Eat not of Allah, and do not act corruptly in the land.
And you said: "O Moses, do not be patient with food, we will not be able to do so, for our Lord's leave, to the earth of the earth, and of its cucumbers, and its cucumbers, and its garlic, and its mothers, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you and raised you above the Mount (Sinai), saying: "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember that which is in it, so that you may fear Allah."
Then you turned back after it was not for the grace of Allah and His mercy and His mercy, that you would surely have been among the losers.
And you were aware of those who transgressed among you of the Sabbath, so We said to them, "Be apes, despised."
So We made it a lesson for those who have passed away, and a lesson for them, and a lesson for those who fear Allah.
And when Moses said to his people, "Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Are you mocking us?" He said, "I will take you away from the ignorant."
They said: "Beseech our Lord for us to make plain to us what it has been said to them." He said: "It is not like a cow, nor a young man, nor is there any old thing in the sight of Allah, and that you are commanded."
They said: "Beseech our Lord for us to make plain to us its colour." He said: "He said: He is a yellow cow, a yellow cow, the beholders, the beholders.
They said: "Beseech our Lord for us to make plain to us what it is, to us are alike; and if Allah wills, we will surely be guided."
He said, "It is said to him, ‘It is He who has cast down a cow, not a cow, nor the land, nor the garden, and the food, and he has no food.' They said, 'Bring you the bread,' and they will not be able to kill him.
And when you killed a man, then you disputed with him, and Allah is clear to what you hide.
Then We said to him, "Strike the part of the cow, so that Allah may bring the dead to life, and He will bring you to life, and that you may understand."
Then then your hearts are hardened, as though they are rocks, and are worse as if they are rocks; and there are some of them that gush forth from it; and some of them are scattered by water; and some of them are afraid of the sight of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you expect that they have surrendered to you (O Muhammad SAW) that a group of them should hear the word of Allah, when they hear the Word of Allah, and then they know that it is they who do not understand?
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe"; but when they meet each other with each other, they say: "Do you speak to them what Allah has revealed to you?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they hide and what they hide?
And among them are those who do not know the Book except the Book, but they follow nothing but conjecture.
So woe to those who have been given the Book to their own souls, they say, "This is from Allah," so they say, "This is from Allah, so that they may take a small price for a small price; so woe to them for what they have earned and what they have earned."
And they say: "The Fire will not touch us except for a few numbered days." Say: "Have you taken a promise from Allah, and that Allah will not break His promise?"
Those who do evil deeds and their deeds are the inmates of the Fire, they are the inmates of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, these are the dwellers of Paradise; they will abide therein forever.
And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: "Worship none but Allah, and give good tidings to the parents, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and to the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the poor, and the prayer, and the prayer, and the prayer, then, after you have turned away, then you have turned away from you."
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you (O Muhammad SAW): "Do not shed your blood (to your blood), nor turn your backs from your people from your homes, and you will be witnesses."
Then you will kill your people from a people who kill you, and from a people a group of a people who have transgressed against you, and some of them are some of them, and some of them are of you; and if they reach you, they will not be able to kill you; and if they reach you, they will have a grievous punishment in this world; and the punishment of the Day of Judgment will come to you, and they will be returned to the punishment of the Day of Resurrection; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world in exchange for the life of this world, so they will not be able to be helped, nor will they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book, and We sent messengers after him. And We gave Jesus the son of Mary with clear signs, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. And when there came to you a Messenger with the angels, you would not be proud of the angels, and some of you slew others. So you slew others and others.
And they say, "Our hearts are wrapped in their hearts; but Allah has cursed them, so that they may believe."
And when the Book came to them from Allah confirming what is with them, confirming what is with them, and they wish to help those who disbelieve. When it comes to them, they disbelieve in it, and the curse of Allah is upon those who disbelieve.
That is because they have sold their souls in that which they have been sent down by Allah, so that they may disbelieve in Allah's command, so that Allah may bestow His Mercy upon whom He wills of His servants. They will have incurred wrath from the wrath of Allah. And the disbelievers will have a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what has been sent down to us," and they disbelieve in what they have been sent to.
Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you took the calf after the calf, and you were unjust.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you and raised you above Mount Sinai (saying): "Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen to those who have been given you." They said: "We hear not," and their hearts disbelieved in the calf of their hearts. Say: "This is what is what is forbidden for you, if you are believers."
Say: "If the abode of the Hereafter is for Allah alone, there is no other than for mankind except for mankind, if you are truthful."
And they will not wish to wish for that which they have earned before their deeds; and Allah is All-Knower of the unjust.
And you will find them more than the people of the people and those who are polytheists, and those who are idolaters, and each one of them wants to be given a thousand years; and they will not be able to protect him from the punishment of Allah; and Allah sees what they do.
Say: "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, it is He who has sent down to you the Qur'an by the Qur'an by your heart, confirming what is before it, and guidance and glad tidings for the believers."
“Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His angels, His angels, and His Messengers, and Gabriel, and Gabriel, that Allah is the enemy of the disbelievers.”
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) clear signs (i.e., the Qur'an) to you, and none can reject the limits except those who disbelieve.
And when they have heard a covenant, it will be a part of them; but most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming what is with them, a party of those who were given the Book behind the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they were not aware of it.
And those who follow him (the Jews) were the ones who have been deceived by the devil, and they were the ones who disbelieved in the devil, and they disbelieved in the devil, but they disbelieved in him. And the magicians were in the midst of the angels, and they were unable to follow their own souls. And they were the ones who were in the midst of the angels, and they were unable to follow their own souls. And they were in the midst of their own souls, and they were not able to take it away from their own souls. And they were not aware of what they were saying.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, the reward of Allah would have been better for them, if they knew.
O you who have believed, do not say, "Do not say, ‘Do not speak,’ and say, "It is a painful punishment, and a painful punishment."
Those who disbelieve not among the People of the Book and those who have been sent down to you from your Lord, (O Muhammad), from any other than a Messenger, and that Allah will bestow His Mercy upon whom He wills, and Allah will bestow His Mercy on whom He pleases.
(10:102) (10) Who do not abrogate the verse or cause it to be forgotten, or We bring it to oblivion, or do you know that Allah has power over all things?
Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, and that you have no protector besides Allah, and that you have no protector?
Or did you ask about your Messenger (Muhammad), when Moses was questioned about what Moses did, then he who believes in a believer, who has strayed from the path of a righteous path?
Many of the People of the Book wish to deceive you after they have believed after you have believed after they have believed, then after that the truth has become clear to them. And pardon Allah, and forgive and overlook; for Allah has power over all things.
And establish prayer, and give alms, and whatever good you have sent before you, you will find it with God; for God sees what you do.
And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew and a Christian." They are their own desires; say: "Produce your proof, if ye are truthful."
Nay, whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is a doer of good, he will have his reward with his Lord; and there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews say, "The Christians are not true," and the Christians say, "The Jews have no right to follow the Jews," but they recite the Book. They do not know what they do not know. God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they differ.
And who is more unjust than he who prevents the people of Allah in the mosques of Allah, seeking His remembrance, and strives for their ruin, and strives for them in the fear of those who fear Him? For them is disgrace in this world, and in the hereafter is a grievous punishment.
And to Allah belong the East and the West; then you turn away from Him; surely Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
And they say: "Allah has taken a son (a son) to Himself." Glory be to Him, that He is the One Who is in the heavens and the earth. All is in the heavens and the earth.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees a thing, He says to it, "Be!" and it is.
And those who do not know say: "Why does Allah not speak to us, or to bring us a sign?" They said: "We are the hearts of those who have gone before them." And those who have been given the signs say: "We are the ones who believe."
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a bearer of glad tidings to those who have come to you, and as a warner, and you will not be questioned about the Fire.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor will they follow you until you follow their religion. Say: "The guidance of Allah is the guidance of Allah." And if you follow their desires, let them follow their desires, and follow their desires; for you have no protector or helper.
Those who have been given the Book, read it as it is recited to it, as it is written, they believe in it; and those who disbelieve therein will be the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you in the world.
And guard yourselves on a Day when no soul shall be paid to another soul, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall they be helped.
And when Abraham had fulfilled his Lord's commands, he fulfilled it with a certain word, and he said: "I am going to make you a leader of the people." He said: "I will surely make you a son of the wrong-doers." He said: "My son is not a trial to the unjust."
And when We made the people a place of security and a place of security for the people, and We made a place of security to the House of Abraham, and We commanded Abraham to establish the prayer of Abraham, and We commanded Abraham, and Isaac, and those who prostrate themselves.
And when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city a City of security and provide its people with fruits, and provide them with fruits in the Last Day." He said, "Do not believe in faith." He said, "I will give him a life of a city, and then the punishment of the Fire will be a terrible place."
And when Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House with the foundations of the House, (saying): "Our Lord! Accept from us from us; surely Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."
Our Lord, make us submissive to Thee, and make us a community of a community, and raise us to a community that is submissive to us, and forgive us our sins; surely Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.
“Our Lord, raise up from among them a Messenger from among themselves who will recite to them Your verses, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and purify them.
And those who do not follow the religion of Abraham, except that he is a fool to follow him, and We have made him in this world; and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I submit to the Lord of the Worlds."
And Abraham commanded his sons and his sons, saying: "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you the religion of Allah, so do not die except as Muslims."
Do you claim when death came to you, when he said to his sons, "Will you worship me after that?" They said, "We will worship your God." They said, "We worship your God, and Abraham, and Isaac, and Isaac, and we are Muslims."
This is a nation that have passed away from what they have earned, and for you is what they have earned, and you will not be questioned for what you used to do.
And they say, "Become Jews or Christians, you will be guided." Say: "We follow the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say: "We believe in Allah, and in that which We have sent down to Him, and that which was sent down to him, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and the tribes, and the tribes, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and all that We have sent down to the Prophets of the prophets."
And if they believe as they believe, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, they are in schism; but if they turn away, they are in schism; and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
"Who is better than Allah, and who is better than Allah?
Say: "Do you dispute with us about Allah, seeing that He is our Lord, and your Lord, and your Lord, and your Lord, and for you are your deeds, and we are sincere to Him?"
Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Jews were Jews or Christians? Say: "Are you better than Allah?" Say: "Are you better than Allah?" And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
This is a community that have passed away; for them is what they have earned, and for you is what you have earned; and you will not be questioned for what they used to do.
The people of the people will say, "Did they turn away from the qiblah of those who were before them?" Say: "To Allah belongs the East and the West. He guides whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills."
Thus have We made you a community justly balanced, that you may be witnesses over the people, and that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may not follow a witness against you, except that the Messenger and those who follow him turn away from his heels. And those who follow Allah's guidance, and those who follow him. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
We will see your face in the sky. We will surely turn you to a qiblah, and We will surely turn you back to the qiblah of the Sacred Mosque. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are, they will know that their Lord is the truth of their Lord. God is not unaware of what they do.
And to those who have been given the Book, they will not follow your qiblah, nor will they follow your qiblah; nor do you follow their qiblah, nor do they follow the qiblah of their qiblah; and if they follow the knowledge, then you follow their desires.
Those who have given the Book to whom We have given the Book recognize it, they recognize their sons, and most of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of the doubters.
And every soul has a direction to whom he will be returned; then vie with that which is good; then Allah will bring you together together; surely Allah has power over all things.
And (O Muhammad), when you turn away from the Sacred Mosque, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you go forth, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you turn, it will be no argument for you to be charged with any other people except those who do wrong, so fear them, so that you may not be able to fear them, so that I may complete My favour upon you, and that you may be guided.
“We have sent among you a Messenger from among you who recites to you Our Verses, and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and the wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know.”
So remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek help in patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the patient.
And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive, but you do not perceive.
And We will certainly test you with a single fear of hunger and hunger, and of loss and lives, and of the fruits of lives, and of the fruits of lives. And give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere.
Those who, when afflicted with calamity, say: "We belong to Allah, and to Him we shall return."
They are those on whom are the Salawat on their Lord and His mercy, and they are those who are guided.
And the Safa and the Marwah are among the signs of Allah; and whoever is in the House of Allah, there is no sin in it; and whoever does good, it is no sin for him; and whoever does good, it is not for him, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.
Those who follow the clear signs and the guidance, We have made them clear to those who have been sent down to the Book, and in the Book, that they may be cursed, and Allah will curse those who curse themselves.
Except those who repent and do good deeds, and make clear to them their repentance; and I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, they are the angels of Allah, and the angels, and all mankind.
They will abide therein, and they will not be punished, nor will they be reprieved.
And your God is Allah, the One God; there is no god but He, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night, and the alternation of the night, and the day, and the ships, and the sea, and the sea, and the sea, and the sea, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, in the earth, are signs for the people.
And there are some people who assign to Allah as they associate others with Allah, as they love Allah as well as they love Allah. And those who have been unjust in the sight of Allah, they will see that they see the punishment. And if they do wrong, they will see that they see the punishment, and Allah is severe in punishment.
When those who follow those who follow those who follow them will be punished, and they will see the punishment of their hearts.
And they will say: "If we were to return to this world, we will say: 'If we were to return to the truth, we would certainly have been averse to those who are averse to us. Allah will make their deeds fair-seeming to them, and they will not be of the Fire.'
O mankind, eat from what is in the earth and eat of what is in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your enemy.
He has forbidden you of evil and shameful deeds, and that you do not know what you do not know.
And when it is said to them: "Follow what Allah has sent down," they say: "We follow what we found our fathers following."
And the parable of those who disbelieve are like the parable of those who call upon him, except that which they call upon besides Him, and call not upon Him, deaf, dumb, blind, and blind.
O you who have believed, eat from the good things which We have provided you, and give thanks to Allah if it is that you worship Him.
He has only forbidden you to die, and blood, and blood, and swine, and that which is in the name of Allah, that which is called by Him; and that which is in the name of sin, is no sin, nor exceeding any sin; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who have been sent down to the Book of Allah in the Book of Allah, seeking that which is in the Book of Allah, and that they gain a small price for their souls, and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
They are those who have purchased error for guidance and forgiveness for their sins. How do you think that they are the owners of the Fire?
That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) in the Book, confirming that which is in the Book (i.e. the Book), and those who are in the Book (i.e. the Book) are in a schism far in opposition.
You will not be able to call the mountains from the East and the West, and the righteous, and the righteous, whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the orphans, and the needy, and the prophets, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the needy, and those who are patient, and those who are patient, and those who are patient, they are the truthful.
O you who have believed, the believers will be given to you in order that you may be tempted by a woman who has passed away from you, and the woman who has passed away from his wife, he is a slave of the woman who has gone away from him, and he who turns away from his own accord, he will have a painful punishment. This is a mercy from your Lord. This is a mercy from your Lord.
“And verily, for you is the life of your souls, that you may guard (against evil).
And when death approaches you, if death approaches you, he should bequeath that he should bequeath for parents and near relatives and near the righteous.
And whoever changes it after he turns away from it, it will be for those who follow it; surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

And when she had delivered her, she said, "My Lord, I have given birth to a girl; and Allah knows best what she had given birth, and the male is not like the female, and I have named her Mary, and I have named her and her offspring from Satan, the outcast Satan."
So his Lord gave him good things, and gave him a goodly gifts, and made her a goodly mate, and made her a son. And when she prayed to her, she said: "O Mary, come to Allah," he said, "from Allah," he said, "from Allah," he said, "from Allah," he said, "from Allah, whom He wills."
He prayed to his Lord, saying, "My Lord, grant me from Yourself a son from Yourself. You are the All-Hearer, the All-Hearing."
Then the angels called to him in prayer, while he stood in the sanctuary, (saying): "Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya (John), confirming the Word of Allah, a Word from Allah, and a Prophet, and a Prophet, and a Prophet."
He said, "My Lord, how will I have a son when I have reached old age, and my wife is barren?" He said, "God does what He wills."
He said, "My Lord, grant me a sign of a sign." He said, "This is a sign for you, that you may not speak to the day of the night, but remember your Lord, and remember Him in the morning and the evening."
And [mention] when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds.
O Mary, be devoutly obedient to your Lord, prostrate and prostrate, and bow with those who bow (in prayer).
This is part of the tidings of the tidings of the unseen unseen, which We reveal to you (O Muhammad SAW) with inspiration to you, and you were not with them when they cast lots with lots of Maryam (Mary), and you were not with them when they were disputing.
And when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a Word from Him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, distinguished in this world and the Hereafter, and among those who are near to Allah."
He will speak to the people in the cradle and in the cradle, and he will be one of the righteous.
He said, "My Lord, how will I have a son when no man has touched me?" He said, "God creates what He wills." He said, "It is He who creates what is done, and He is the One who is the one who creates it."
And He has revealed to him the Book and the Gospel and the Torah and the Gospel.
And He sent a Messenger to the Children of Israel, and said, "I have come to you from your Lord." He said, "I have sent you out of the midst of the winds, and I have brought you forth from the tree of God." Then, when you eat, it is the command of God, and that you may eat from the flesh of God, and that you may be able to eat from the flesh of God.
"And I have come to you confirming that which was before me of the Taurat (Torah), and to make lawful to you part of that which was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me."
Verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him; this is the Straight Way.
Then when Jesus came to the unbelievers, he said: "Who will be my helpers in the cause of Allah?" The disciples said: "We are Allah's helpers." We believe in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims.
Our Lord, we believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger.
And they planned and planned, and Allah planned, and Allah is the best of planners.
(Remember) when Allah said: "O Jesus, indeed I will raise you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me will be your return, and then to Me will be your return, then I will judge between you concerning what you differ.
And those who disbelieve, I will punish them with severe torment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.
As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, He will pay them their wages; and Allah does not love the unjust.
This is what We recite to you (O Muhammad) that which is signs and the Book, the Wise, the Wise.
“The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: "Be!" and he was.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of the doubters.
Then, when they come to you with knowledge after they come to you, say, "Come, let us take our sons, our sons, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and we shall call upon the curse of Allah."
This is the true truth, and there is no god but Allah; and Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
But if they turn away, then Allah knows the transgressors.
Say: "O People of the Book (Jews and Christians), come to a word that is equitable between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us take others as lords besides Allah."
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham, and the Torah and the Gospel, and the Torah after him? Will you not then understand?
You are the ones who have argued about that which you have no knowledge about which you have no knowledge.
Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian, but he was a Muslim, and he was not of the polytheists.
Abraham is those who follow him who believes in him and his messenger, and who believes in him, and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
A group of the People of the Book wish that they may lead you astray, but they do not mislead themselves except themselves, and they do not perceive.
O People of the Book, why do you not believe in Allah's signs, while you bear witness?
O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and conceal the truth, while you know?
And some of the People of the Book say: "Believe in what is revealed to the believers in the morning, in order that they may believe in the day of Allah."
And do not believe except those who follow your religion. Say: "The guidance of Allah is the guidance of those who have been given you." Say: "It is the guidance of those who have been given you." Say: "It is in Allah's hand; He grants it to whom He pleases; and Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
He bestows His grace upon whom He will, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.
And among the People of the Book there is a party of the People of the Book, if you give them a gift, then they will return to you, and there is no party of them if you have put him behind him. That is because they say, "We are not responsible for any of those who are ignorant." That is because they say, "We are not responsible for the ignorant," they say, "We are not responsible for the ignorant."
But as for him who fulfills his pledge and fears Allah, verily, Allah loves those who fear Him.
Those who have a small price for Allah and their oaths for a small price for a small price, they will have no share in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
And there is a group among them who distort their tongues with their tongues, that you may be able to say to the Book, "It is not a Book from Allah," and they say, "This is from Allah." They say, "It is from Allah." And they know that they are liars.
(10:15) And not for any human being that Allah has given him the Book and the wisdom and the Prophethood and the Prophethood, and he said: "I have been commanded to worship Allah, the Lord of the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and that you may be given the Book."
And did not the angels and the prophets take you to believe in the Lord and the prophets that you have surrendered to Him, then then, if you have surrendered to Him, then then would you disbelieve?
And (remember) when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets (saying): "I have given you the Book and the Hikmah (Torah), confirming what is with you, confirming what is with you, you believe in him, and you help him."
But those who turn away from it will be the transgressors.
“Do they seek other than Allah's religion, that they may submit to Him, and submit to Him in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, and to Him will they be returned?”
Say: "We believe in Allah and that which has been revealed to us, and that which has been revealed to us, and Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Jacob, and Jacob, and Jacob, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and all that We have sent down to Abraham, and that we believe in Allah."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and he will be one of the losers in the Hereafter.
How can Allah guide those who disbelieved after they have disbelieved after they have disbelieved, and that they might bear witness that the Messenger has come to them with clear proofs? And Allah does not guide the unjust.
Those are they who have incurred the punishment of Allah, the angels, the angels, and all mankind.
They will abide therein, and they will not be punished, nor will they be reprieved.
Except those who repent after that, and make amends, verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
But those who disbelieve after their disbelief, then disbelieve, then they will not be accepted from their repentance; and they are the losers.
Those who disbelieve and die while they die, the earth will not be able to reach the earth, even if it should be as if it should be as if it should be a ransom. They will have a painful punishment.
You will not attain righteousness unless you love that which you love; and whatever you spend, Allah knows it well.
[21:112] It was lawful for the Children of Israel that was forbidden for the Children of Israel that was forbidden by the Law of Moses before it had been revealed before it, and say, "Produce the Torah, if you are truthful."
So those who invent a lie against Allah will be unjust.
Say, "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham, monotheism, and he was not of the polytheists."
“Verily, the first House (of worship) established for mankind is that at Bakkah (Makkah), and a guidance for the House (of Allah), and a guidance for all mankind.”
There are signs in the clear verses of Abraham; and whoever enters it, it is a place of security; and whoever enters it, it is safe for him; and the people who have disbelieved in him will be saved; and whoever disbelieves, God is not able to save the worlds.
Say: "O People of the Book! why do you not believe in Allah's signs, and that Allah is the witness of what you do?"
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you seek to bar those who believe in the path of Allah, seeking the path of Allah?
O you who have believed, if you obey a group of those who have been given the Book, they will turn you back after you have believed.
And how do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, when you are recited to Allah, and in His Messenger, and in His Messenger, and who is in the right path? And those who follow Allah's commands, He will guide him to a straight path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast to the covenant of Allah with all that you have been commanded, and do not be divided in the remembrance of Allah, and remember the favor of Allah when you were enemies, and He made your hearts into your hearts, and you were not afraid of the fire of the fire, and He saved you from the brink of the Fire. Thus Allah makes clear to you His signs, that haply you may be guided.
And there is a group among you who calls to the good of that which is good, and that which is good and forbid what is shameful, and it is they who are the successful.
And be not like those who were divided and disagreed after clear proofs had come to them, and they will have a painful punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces faces faces, and those whose faces are black will be asked, "Did you reject your faith after your faith?" Then you have disbelieved.
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the signs of Allah, which We recite to you (O Muhammad SAW) that you may recite the truth, and Allah does not desire the wrong-doers.
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and to Him is the return of all things.
You are the best of the people who have been created to be the best of the people, and that you enjoin what is right, and that you believe in Allah, and that you believe in Allah, and that the Book of the People of the Book would have been better for them.
They will not harm you except by a hurt, and if they fight you, they will turn their backs to you, and they will not be helped.
It is they who have incurred a curse from Allah and the people, except for the people, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they have incurred wrath from Allah, and they have incurred wrath from Allah. That is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah, and they kill the prophets. That is because they disobeyed the signs of Allah, and they are transgressors.
They are not equal to the People of the Book; there is a community among the People of the Book, reciting the signs of Allah in the watches of the night, and in prayer.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and forbid what is wrong, and they are among the righteous.
And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it; and Allah knows the pious.
Those who disbelieve, neither shall their wealth nor their children avail them aught against Allah. Those are the companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein.
Those who spend in the life of this world is like the like of the like of the wind, as a wind of the harvest which they have wronged themselves, and it destroys it; and Allah does not wrong them, but they are wronged.
O you who have believed, do not make friends of those who do not believe in the religion of those who do not believe in you, but they do not think that they are forbidden by you. They have been forbidden by their mouths. And what their hearts conceal is greater than what their hearts conceal. We have made clear to you the signs.
You are those who love them, and they love you not, and you do not love those who believe in the Book of Allah. When they meet you, they say, "We believe"; and when they meet you, they keep their fingers in their rage. Say: "Do not kill yourselves. God knows what is in the hearts of the hearts."
If good befalls you, it grieves them; but if it afflicts you with evil, they rejoice in it; and if you are patient, and fear Allah, their guile will not hurt you; surely Allah encompasses what they do.
(Remember) when you (O Muhammad SAW) go forth from your family in the morning (i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) in the morning (i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) in the morning (i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). And Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
When the two parties met between you, Allah desired to help them, and Allah is their Protector.
And Allah helped you at Badr when you were a contemptible little force; so fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down?"
“If you are patient, and fear Allah, and fear Him, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels with angels.”
And Allah has not given you the glad tidings of good news and that your hearts may be filled with security; and Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
It may be that He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve, or expose them to infamy, so that they may turn away.
You do not have any concern with what is in the matter, or whether He turns to them, He will punish them or punish them.
And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah's; He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He pleases; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that you may be successful.
And fear the Fire because of the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Messenger, that you may be shown mercy.
“And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whose width is as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.”
Those who spend in prosperity and adversity, who repress anger, and restrain anger, and pardon men; and Allah loves those who do good.
And those who, when they have committed an indecency or wronged themselves, remember Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins, and who can forgive sins except Allah?
The reward of those who have their reward with their Lord is forgiveness and gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein; and how excellent is the reward of the righteous.
Many have passed away before you, so travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a reminder for mankind, a guidance and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
“And do not grieve, nor grieve, but be patient, if you are believers.”
And if a wound has afflicted you, like a wound like those who have disbelieved, We have made some of those who have disbelieved, and some of them We have made some of the people, so that Allah may know those who believe, and that Allah may test you, and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test those who believe and disbelieve in the disbelievers.
Do you think that you will enter Paradise, and that Allah will not allow you to be among those who strive against you, and those who are patient?
And indeed you wish to die before death before you met him, so that you may see it.
And Muhammad is not an apostle, but there is a Messenger before him; then if he dies, then shall you turn back on your heels, or if he dies, then will you turn back on your heels? And if they turn back to his heels, Allah will not harm him.
And death is not for death except by Allah's leave; and whosoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him thereof; and whosoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We shall give him of it; and We shall reward him for the reward of the Hereafter.
And many of the prophets were fought with many of them, and were many of them in the way of Allah; they did not weaken in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken.
And their saying, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and make us steadfast in our affair, and make us firm, and grant us victory over the disbelieving people."
And Allah gave them the reward of this world and the reward of the Hereafter, and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back to your heels, then you will be losers.
Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they associated with Allah for that which He has sent down no authority; and their abode is the Fire, and the evil is the abode of the unjust.
And verily, Allah has promised the promise of your promise true, so that you might be killed with him, and that you had been killed with him, and that you might differ about that which you have been charged with, and you have been made to differ about that which He has made you. And if you have been given the life of the life of the world, you will surely be able to kill you, and you will surely be able to forgive you. He will forgive you from what He wishes. And Allah is the possessor of the believers.
When you have turned away, then you do not come to any other people, and the Messenger will call you to you, and you will not be called by the Messenger of Allah. He has subjected to you an evil punishment that you should not grieve from what you have earned, and Allah is aware of what you do.
Then He has sent down upon you a river, so that you may have a party of you, and a group of you who have wronged you, and some of them who have wronged themselves. They said, "What is the matter for us?" They said, "What is Allah?" They said, "It is not for us." They said, "This is what God has given us." They said, "This is what is in the hands of Allah." They said, "It is not for us." They said, "If we had been in your homes, they would have been able to hide it."
Those on you who turned on the day when the two armies met the two armies, they made their souls known to them, so that they had been made known to you; and Allah has pardoned them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who have believed, do not be like those who disbelieve and say to their brothers when they travel in the land or fight in the land, "If they had been with us, they would not have died, and they would not have been killed." God gives life and causes death to die; and God gives life and causes death.
And if you are slain in the way of Allah or die in the cause of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah is better than what they amass.
And if you die or die, you will be gathered to Allah.
And Allah's mercy is upon them, (O Muhammad), to be lenient with them; and if you were harsh and fierce hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from around you; so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and ask forgiveness for them; then when you have decided, then put your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who are steadfast.
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, then can He help you?
And there is not a Messenger (Prophet Muhammad) but he who deceives himself, then he will be subjected to what he has forbidden, and then every soul will be paid to the Day of Resurrection for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who has incurred wrath from Allah, whose abode is Hell, and his abode is Hell?
They are in varying grades with Allah, and Allah sees what they do.
“Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He raised among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Signs, and purifying them, and instructing them in the Book and the Wisdom, although they were in manifest error.”
And when the affliction befell you, when you had been afflicted with hardship, you would have said, "This is what is from it." Say: "This is from your own accord." Say: "This is from your own accord; Allah has power over all things."
And what befell you on the day when the two armies met in the sight of Allah, and that He might test the believers.
And the hypocrites know that they were told to fight in the cause of Allah, and said: "Come in the way of Allah," or they said: "If we had been known, we would certainly have been with you." They said: "If we had been with you, we would certainly have been with you." They say: "They are not in their hearts." They say, "God knows what is in their hearts; and Allah knows what they hide."
They are those who said to their brothers: "If they were to say, 'If they had been with us, they would not have been killed.' Say, "If you are truthful, then you will surely be truthful."
And do not think that those who are killed in Allah's way are dead; nay, they are alive, and they are alive with their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has given them of His Grace, and that they have no portion of those who are behind them, for those who have not yet joined them with them, they have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the Grace of Allah and His grace, and that Allah does not reward the believers.
Those who responded to the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), after those who have been righteous (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and those who have been righteous, and those who have done righteous deeds, shall have a great reward.
Those to whom the people said, "The people have gathered against you, so fear them; but it only increased their faith, and they said: Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the Best of affairs."
So they returned to Allah's grace and grace, and they did not hurt them, nor did they grieve from the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the possessor of grace.
It is only Satan who suggests to you the fear of his Auliya (supporters and friends), so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And let not those who disbelieve grieve against you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) until they do not harm Allah. They will not be wronged by Allah. Allah will not punish them in the Hereafter, and they will have a painful punishment.
Those who purchase disbelief for the price of disbelief, do not hurt Allah in the least, but they have a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for them; We grant them respite only that they may increase in their sins; and they shall have a humiliating punishment.
It is not for Allah that you should believe in the believers when you are believers, and Allah will not leave the evil of the evil, and Allah will not inform you of what He wills. So believe in Allah and His messengers. If you believe, you will have a great reward. And if you believe, you will have a great reward.
And do not think that those who are niggardly in the favour of Allah are to do not think that it is better for them, that it may be better for them, that it may be better for them, that they may be niggardly on the Day of Resurrection. And the heavens and the earth belong to Allah. And Allah is Aware of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Verily, Allah has heard the saying of those who say: "We are Allah's servants," and they are rich, and We say: "We shall not kill the prophets," and they shall say: "Taste the Penalty of the Fire," and We shall say: "Taste the Penalty of the Fire!"
That is because of that which your hands have sent before, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say: "Allah has promised us to believe in a Messenger unless he should bring a Messenger to Us," they say: "Messengers before me came to you," say: "Messengers before me came to you with clear proofs, and with what ye say: why did ye slay them, if ye are truthful?"
And if they reject you, they would certainly have denied you before you (O Muhammad), and the Messengers who came to them with clear proofs, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book.
Every soul shall have a taste of death; and you shall be recompensed for what you have earned, and the Day of Resurrection will be paid to you on the Day of Resurrection. He who has gone away from the Fire will be rewarded. This is the life of the world.
You will surely be tested in your wealth and in your souls, and you will surely hear from those who have been given the Book before you and those who have been given the Book before you, and those who have been given the Book of Allah and those who fear Allah.
And (remember) when Allah took a covenant with the People of the Book (i.e. the Qur'an), that you may explain to the people (i.e. the Qur'an) to mankind, and that you may not hide it, and it was not that they threw away their backs, and they threw their backs in a small price.
"Do not think that those who rejoice with what they have been pleased with, and love for what they do not have to be praised, and do not think that the punishment will be for them.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah has power over all things.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night, and the alternation of the night and the day, there are signs for those who are wise.
Those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, sitting, or lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: "Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You, therefore, protect us from the punishment of the Fire."
“Our Lord, those who admit You to the Fire, You have disgraced him; and the unjust will have no helpers.”
Our Lord, we have heard the caller calling to you, “Believe in your Lord,” and believe in your Lord, and we have believed, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and let us die from the righteous."
Our Lord, grant us what You have promised us with what You have promised us, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection.
Then their Lord said to them, "I will not be able to kill you, or to do not kill you, or to do not kill you; some of you are all alike, and they will go home, and they will go home, and they will remain in the way, and they will remain in the way, and they will be followed in the Garden of Eden, and they will be in the gardens of Eden, and they will be in the Gardens of Eden; for Allah is the best reward."
Let not the land of the disbelievers deceive you from the earth.
This is a brief enjoyment; then their abode is Hell, and evil is the destination.
And those who fear their Lord, they are Gardens of rivers flowing beneath them, in which rivers flow, abiding therein; and that which is with Allah is the best of the good, and that which is with Allah is the best of the righteous.
And there are some of the People of the Book who believe in Allah and what has been sent down to you, and what has been sent down to them. Those who do not believe in Allah's communications, they have a small price for a small price. Those who have their reward with their Lord will be rewarded with their reward. God is swift in reckoning.
O you who have believed, be patient and excel (in patience), and be steadfast in patience, and fear Allah, that you may be successful.
O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and created it from its mate, and from the women He created many men and women, and fear Allah, that you should be one of the names of Allah. Allah is a witness over you.
And give the orphans their wealth, and do not exchange the good things of the good, and do not consume your property, and do not eat your property. Indeed, this is a great punishment.
And if you fear that you do not do the good, then do not make one of the women among the women of your wives; and if you fear them, then you will not be able to do justice, or if you fear, or do not be afraid, that you may not be able to do justice.
And give the women their dowries with a free gift; but if they are pleased with you, they will be given to you a part of that which you have given.
And do not make the mistake that Allah has made for you, that He may provide for you a means of livelihood for you, and provide them from some of them and speak to them good words.
And marry the orphans until they reach the age of age until they reach the age of age. And if you are with them, then give them their property, and do not fear, but do not fear, and do not fear the needy. And if you give a provision to the needy, he wants to be modest. And if you give them a share, then bear witness to them; and Allah is sufficient, sufficient.
(15:15) For those who are near to the parents, and near the parents, and give near to their parents, and give wives to the parents, and of the women of their wives, and of the women of the women, whether it be a little, or if they are a little,
And when the relatives and the needy are present, the orphans and the needy are present to them, and speak to them words of kindness, and speak to them words of kindness.
And fear those who fear him, if they should take their children behind their children, so that they may fear Allah.
Those who are in the property of the orphans, eat from their own souls, except their bellies in the fire, and they will be in the blazing Fire.
God has given you the sons of your children to give you wives; and if they are two women, they are two women, and if they are two women, they are two of them; and if they are two women, he is one of the two women; and if he is a son, he is one of the males, and the one who is near to his parents, and if he is a son, then he is one of the people who are near to Allah. And if he is a son, then he is a son of men. And if he is a son, he is the one who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

And if any man has a son, he will not be able to give birth to his wife, and he is a son of his brother; and if he is driven to his brother, he is one of the two brothers; and he is the one who knows what is behind them, and his brother is one of the two women. And if they are married, they will have two wives; and Allah knows all things.
O you who have believed, fulfill the pledge which you have made for you, as you have been commanded to be mentioned in the remembrance of Allah, and that you may not be able to seek the pilgrimage. God does what He wills.

They ask you about their own souls, and say: "It is lawful for you to eat," say: "It is good for you, and that you may have a good thing." It is that which Allah has commanded for you, that you may be commanded by what He has taught you. That is what Allah has ordained for you, and that you may be careful of Allah; surely Allah is swift in retribution.
This day you have provided for you the food of the Book, and the Book, and the food that is lawful for you; and it is for you that you eat for food, and that you may be modest. And if you have been given the Book of the Book, those who have disbelieved in the Book of the Book have been given to the women of those who have been given the Book, and those who have been given the Book, and those who have been given the Book, and those who have disbelieved in the Book of the Book, are not able to be able to be able to be a believer.
O you who believe! when you pray to your prayer, turn your backs on your faces, and take your hands on your backs, and keep your backs on you in the day of their backs; and if you reach the Holy Spirit, then you will be satisfied with it; and if you are pregnant, then you will be pleased with a wall, or if you are pregnant, or if you reach the Holy Spirit, then you will be cut off, or if you are pregnant.
And remember Allah's favor upon you, and His covenant which He made with you, when you said: "We hear and we obey," and fear Allah, and fear Allah, that Allah is the Knower of the breasts.
O you who have believed, bear witness to the justice of Allah with justice, and do not follow the people, and do not be afraid of the people. So fear Allah, and fear Allah; and fear Allah, that you do not know.
Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have forgiveness and a great reward.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, these are the inmates of the Fire.
O you who have believed, remember Allah's favor upon you when He desired to destroy you with their own souls, that he might turn away from you from their hands. Fear Allah, and fear Allah; and Allah is the Best of believers.
And Allah took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We raised among them twelve leaders; and Allah said: "Truly, I am with you, if you establish regular prayer, and give the alms, and give you victory in the Messenger, and if you do the prayer, and do not believe in My Messenger, and admit them to gardens of rivers, and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow, and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow.
So because of their breaking of their covenant, We cursed them, and We made their hearts hard for them, so that they should go out of their ornaments in the darkness of their ornaments, and they did not know what they were reminded of. So pardon them, and pardon them; and pardon them, and pardon them; surely Allah loves those who do good.
And those who say: "We are Christians," We took a covenant with them, and they neglected a part of what they were reminded of, and We make enmity between them until the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will inform them of what they did.
O People of the Book, there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much of that which you used to hide in the Book, and passing over many of them.
“Allah guides those who follow His pleasure to His pleasure, and brings them out of darkness into darkness by His permission, and guides them to a straight path.”
Those who say: "Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary", who say: "Who is the Messiah, the son of Mary, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, and all that is in the earth, and all that is in the earth?"
The Jews and the Christians say: "We are the sons of Allah and his beloved ones." Say: "Why then did He punish you for your sins?" Say: "He is the man of men, whom He has created, and He forgives whom He pleases; and He forgiveth whom He pleases, and chastises whom He pleases; and to Him is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. To Him is the eventual return."
O People of the Book, indeed Our Messenger has come to you, after the cessation of the Messengers has come to you, that you may say, "We have come to you," lest you say, "There came to you a good news of good news and a warner." God has power over all things.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, remember Allah's favor upon you when He made you successors among you and made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the worlds."
O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then you will be losers.
They said, "O Moses, indeed there is a people of tyrannical people, and we will not enter it until they leave it. If they leave it, then we will enter it."
And those two men who feared Allah were afraid of Allah's grace, which they said, "Enter the gate," and they said, "If you are in the gate, then you will be victorious."
They said, "O Moses, we will not enter it until they enter it; and you will be in it, and your Lord will be the one who is the one who is here."
He said, "My Lord, I have no authority over myself except my brother and my brother, so judge between us and the people."
(Allah) said: "It is forbidden for them that the seven years (of years) are forbidden for forty years, so that they may wander in the land, so that you may not be deceived."
Recite to them the story of Adam with the story of the two sons of Adam, when he cried to the two being of the two being, and said to them: "I will surely kill you." He said, "I will surely kill you." He said, "God is the only one who accepts the righteous."
And if you kill me from my hand, kill me not to kill me, to kill me, and I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
I wish that you should be guilty of my sin and your sin, and you will be among the inmates of the Fire, and that is the recompense of the unjust.
So he killed his soul to kill his brother, so he killed him and killed him.
Then Allah sent down a cloud from the earth to the earth, that he might show him his brother, how he said, "What is this that I have been forbidden?" He said, "Woe to me, I am the bread of my brother." Then he turned away, and he turned away.
That is that We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever slays a soul for manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, as if he had killed all mankind; and whoever saveth it, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and verily, Our Messengers came to them with clear proofs, and after that many of them are transgressors.
“The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.”
Except those who repent before you repent, then know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek the means of nearness to Him, and strive in His way that you may be successful.
Verily, those who disbelieve, if they were in the earth, and all that is in the earth, and twice repeated with them the ransom of the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them; and they shall have a painful punishment.
They will wish to get away from the Fire, and they will not be able to escape from it; for them is a lasting punishment.
And as for the thief who steals the male and the female, cut off their hands as a result of what they have earned; for Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
But as for those who repent after his crime, and do righteous deeds, Allah will turn to him in repentance, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Do you not know that Allah is the Owner of the heavens and the earth, whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills, and forgives whom He wills, and Allah is Able to do all things?
O Prophet! Do not grieve against those who disbelieve, because they are averse to those who disbelieve with their mouths. They say, "We believe," they say, "We believe," and their hearts have not come to you, and they have no faith in you. They say, "If you have been commanded, do not have any knowledge from Allah." They say, "If you have been commanded, do not have any knowledge from Allah." They say, "If you have been commanded, it is not for you to do anything."
Those who reject the truth are the names of those who disbelieve, but if they come to you, then judge between them, or turn away from them; and if they turn away from them, they will not be able to make you clear. And if you judge between them, judge between them with justice; surely Allah loves those who do good.
"And how can they follow you (O Muhammad SAW) until they follow the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Torah), the Injeel (Torah), the Injeel (Torah), that they may be (in the Book of) Allah, and they turn away from it (in Islam), and they are not believers?
Indeed, We sent down the Torah in the Torah and the light, and the light, which was sent down to the prophets, and the prophets, and those who were Jews, and the Jews, and the Jews, and the witnesses, so that they were not aware of the Book of Allah. So fear them not, but fear Me; and fear Me, and fear Me not for a small price.
And We decreed for them in the Book that he is a human being, a nose, a nose, an eye for a nose, a nose for a nose, a nose for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth. And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has sent down, it is they who are the unjust.
And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming that which was before him of the Taurat (Torah), and We sent him the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel) that came before it, and a light that came before it, and a guidance and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
And let the People of the Book judge with what Allah has sent down to them, and those who do not judge what Allah has revealed to them, they are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (the Qur'an) with the Book (the Qur'an) which is revealed to you (O Muhammad SAW) with the Book (the Qur'an) which is before the Book (the Qur'an) which is before the Book (the Qur'an) which has been sent down to the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (the Qur'an), which Allah has revealed to you, and that which is revealed to you from the truth (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (the Qur'an), and the Injeel (i.e. the Qur'an), which has been revealed to you from the Book (i.e. the Qur'an).
And follow what Allah has revealed to you, and do not follow their desires; and do not follow their desires, lest you turn away from that which Allah has sent down to you. But if they turn away, then know that Allah will punish them for their sins. And most of mankind are transgressors.
"Do they desire to seek the desire of the Qur'an, and Allah is better than those who have faith?"
O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease in whose hearts they say, "We fear lest a misfortune should befall us," they say, "We fear lest a misfortune from Allah may befall you." Then, after that, they will be forgiven, and they will be remorseful.
And those who believe will say: "Are these the ones who swore by Allah by their strongest oaths by Allah that they are with you?
O you who believe! If any of you turn away from his religion, Allah will bring forth a people whom He will love, and they will love Him, who will love the believers, who are disbelievers in the way of Allah, who strive in the cause of Allah, and do not fear the blame of the critic. This is the grace of Allah. He is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.
“Your guardian is Allah, His Apostle, and the believers, those who worship Him, and those who keep up prayer, and give zakat.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, and those who believe, they will surely be victorious against Allah.
O you who have believed, do not take those who have been given the Book before you as a mockery of those who have been given the Book before you and those who disbelieve, and do not take the disbelievers as allies of Allah.
And when you call to prayer, they take it as mockery and sport; this is because they are a people who understand not.
Say, "O People of the Book, do you resent us except that we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down before us?
Say: "Shall I inform you of something worse than Allah's treatment? Those who incurred Allah's wrath and His wrath, those who incurred Allah's wrath, and those who were transformed with Satan, and those who were transformed with Satan, and those who were transformed with Satan and swine, they are worse than the evil.
And when they come to you, they say: "We believe"; but when they come to disbelief, they are in a state of disbelief, and they are in the midst of those who disbelieve; and Allah knows best what they hide.
And you see many of them that sin, and sin, and of the devouring of the devouring of the unlawful, and that which they have been doing.
Why do they not forbid the rabbis and the rabbis with their tongues, and of what they have forbidden, and what they do?
And the Jews say: "Allah's plan is that they have been averse to Allah." They have their hands with which they have been told that they are not with those who have been arrogant. No one is in the hands of their own hands, and that they may be in the hands of their Lord, and that they may be in the midst of their own souls, and that they may be in the midst of the Fire, and that it may be that those who disbelieve may be in the midst of their own souls, and that they may make mischief in the land. And Allah does not love the unjust.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would certainly have forgiven them of their sins and admitted them to gardens of bliss.
And if they had been given the Torah and the Injeel and the Gospel from their Lord, they would have been sent down to them from their Lord and from their feet; and some of them have been guided from above them and from beneath their feet, and most of them do evil.
O Prophet! Deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord; and if you do not do it, then you will not be able to convey His message; and Allah will protect you from the people; and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
Say, "O People of the Book, you have no right to stand on you until you uphold the Torah and the Gospel, and that you have been sent down to your Lord."
Those who believe, and those who were Jews, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent messengers to them; but when there came to them a Messenger with their own souls, they did not desire to kill themselves, and they denied some of them.
And they thought that it is not for them, so they became blind, and deaf, and deaf, so that they may turn away from them; yet some of them became blind and deaf; and Allah sees what they do.
Those who say: "O Jesus, the son of Mary, the son of Mary." The Messiah said: "O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord, my Lord, and your Lord, and whoever associates with Allah, Allah has forbidden for him the garden of Paradise, and his abode is Hell; and the unjust is the helper of the unjust."
Those who say, "Allah is the One who is the Trinity," and there is no god but He; and there is no god but He. And if they do not desist from what they say, the disbelievers will have a painful punishment.
Why do they not turn back to Allah, and ask for His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, the son of Mary, is no more than a Messenger before him, before him, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, they ate food, so see how We make clear to them the signs, and see how they turn away.
Say: "Do you worship besides Allah that which can neither hurt you nor hurt you? Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Say, "O People of the Book, do not exceed the limits of the truth beyond your religion, and do not follow the desires of the people who went astray before they have gone astray, and they have strayed from the path of the way.
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus Jesus of Mary, the son of Mary, because they disobeyed and transgressed.
They did not forbid one another from what they used to do, and what they did.
You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which their souls have sent before them. Evil is that which Allah has sent down for them, and that they will abide in the punishment of Allah.
And if they had believed in Allah and the Messenger and what was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as allies, but most of them are transgressors.
You will surely find the people of the Jews and those who believe and those who believe and those who are Jews and those who say, "We are Christians." And those who say, "We are Christians." That is because of them are some of them who believe and are not proud.
And when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), you see their eyes overflowing with tears with their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the truth of Allah.
And what is the matter with us that we do not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us, and that our Lord may admit us to the righteous people?
And they said, "Allah has prepared for them the Gardens which rivers flow, beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein; and this is the reward of the righteous."
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, these are the inmates of the Fire.
O you who have believed, do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress limits; surely Allah does not love the transgressors.
And eat of that which Allah has made lawful for you, lawful and good, and fear Allah in Whom you have faith.
God will not raise you in the oaths of your oaths, that you may take your oaths to Him, and that you will not be able to kill you, and that you may not be able to kill the poor, and that you may be able to feed the poor, or that you may be able to do the things that you are seeking, or that you may be able to do the same to you, or that you may be able to do the same.
O you who believe! intoxicants, gambling, gambling, idols, Satan, Satan, Satan, the Satan, so that you may be successful.
Satan wants to seduce you with intoxicants and gambling, and that you should not be able to kill you and the remembrance of Allah and the prayer from the remembrance of Allah. Will you not then desist?
And obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and fear Him; if you turn away, then know that the duty of our duty is only to convey the message.
Those who believe and do righteous deeds, that they have no sin in what they have done, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do good deeds; and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who have believed, Allah will test you with what is in your hands or your spears, and that it may test you, that Allah may test those who fear Him, and that He may punish those who follow Him.
O you who have believed, do not be afraid of the disbelievers, and you will surely be able to kill one another; and whoever kills you, then then he will take you away from the like of that which he has given you, or that he may be a slave of a woman who has been given a good deed, or that he may be a slave, or that he may be a slave, or as a result of the poor, or the poor, or the poor; and Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
It is lawful for you to be the sea of the sea, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for the cattle, and for the pilgrimage, and for the pilgrimage, that you may be mustered to Allah; and fear Allah, to Whom you will be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah for the House, the House, the House, the maintenance of the animals, and the maintenance of the month, and the month, that you may know that you know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and that Allah is aware of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the duty of the Messenger, and Allah knows what you hide and what you hide.
Say, "The good and the bad are not alike, even though the abundance of the rich may be given to you. So fear Allah, so that you may be successful."
O you who have believed, do not ask questions about what you have been told, if you are in a clear manner, if you ask about the Qur'an, they will be made manifest to you. God has forgiven you, and Allah is Forgiving, Clement.
A people before you asked about what they had been asked, and then they disbelieved.
Allah has not made a covenant with the Bahirah, nor of Wasilah, nor of Hami, nor of Hami, nor of Hami; but most of them reject Allah, but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger," they say: "Enough for us is that which we found our fathers following." Even if their fathers were not aware of their fathers, they were not guided.
O you who have believed, do not follow your own souls. If you are guided, you will not have hurt your sins, but God will be returned to you, then He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who believe! if death approaches you, let them find two parties in two ways, so that you may find two parties, but if you are in the land, then you are in the land. If you have no doubt, then you will be able to stand in the land, and if you have doubts, then they will swear to Allah. If you have doubts, then they will swear to Allah, and they will not be able to bear witness to Allah.
And if it is known that the two parties are guilty of the two parties, they have two gods, one of the two ones who have received the truth of their Lord, and they swear by Allah, saying: "Our testimony is truer than the testimony of our testimony, and we are not in the wrong, and we are not of the unjust."
It is likelier that they may be able to bear witness to the truth, or that they may fear their oaths after their oaths, and fear Allah, and fear Allah. And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
On the Day when Allah will gather His messengers, He will say: "What is it that you have received?" They will say: "We have no knowledge. You are the All-Wise."
And when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, "My Lord, I will tell you of my mother and my mother, and to remember that I will give you the Holy Spirit, and that you may be able to help those who follow the Book and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah
And when I inspired the disciples, "Believe in Me and My Messenger," they said: "We believe."
(Remember) when the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, will your Lord send down to us a table food from heaven?"
They said: "We desire that we may eat from it, and that our hearts may be reassured, and that we may know that the truth is true."
Jesus, the son of Mary, said, "O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table table from the heaven that it may be for us to be a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You.
Allah said: "I will send down it (this Qur'an) down from you (O Muhammad SAW), but if you do not follow (this), I will punish him with a severe punishment (i.e., I will punish him with a severe punishment)."
And when Allah will say: "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as gods besides Allah?' He will say, ‘You will surely say, ‘Yes, I know what is in my heart.’ He will say, "Yes, I know what is in my heart, and what is in my heart. You know what is in my heart. You are the All-Knower of all things."
Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say: 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art the Watcher over all things.
“If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, indeed You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”
Allah will say, "This is a day on which the truthful will profit their truthfulness, for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. Allah is well pleased with them and they well pleased with Him. That is the great success."
To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them; and He is Able to do all things.
All praise is due to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and the light, and the light, and the light, and the sight of those who disbelieve.
He it is Who created you from a single soul, then has decreed a term (of a term), then a term (of a term), and a term (of a term); then you have no doubt.
And Allah is He Who is in the heavens and the earth; He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you earn.
There is no sign to them from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
So they denied the truth when it came to them, but they will soon come to the truth of what they used to ridicule.
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them, whom We have established in the earth, and We have not established you in the sky, and We have made the sky flow with rivers flowing beneath them, and We have made the rivers flow beneath them, and We made them a new creation.
And if We had sent down to you a Book on paper on paper, they would have touched it with their hands; those who disbelieve would have said, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say: "Why has not an angel been sent down to him?" If We sent down an angel, that they would have been judged. And if We sent down an angel, they would certainly have been given respite.
And if We had made him an angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We have made it clear to them that they would have been judged.
Messengers were mocked before you, but they mocked them with what they used to ridicule.
Say: "Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who denied the Truth."
Say: "To whom is the dominion of what is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "He is Allah, the One, the All-Merciful." He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection about the Day of Resurrection, for which there is no doubt. They will not believe.
To Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day; and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Say, "Shall I take other than Allah as a guardian for the heavens and the earth, and He feeds whom He will not provide?
Say: "If I do not disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a dreadful day."
On that day, if it is averted from him, then Allah has mercy on him, and that is the manifest achievement.
And if Allah afflicts you with affliction, none can remove it except Him; and if He touches you with good, He has power over all things.
And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise, the All-Wise.
Say to them, "What is the matter of the Qur'an?" Say: "I bear witness that Allah is witness between me and you, and I have revealed to you the Qur'an that it may be revealed to you, and that you may warn those who have been warned from the truth."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize that they recognize their own sons, they recognize their own souls, they will not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or rejects His signs, and who is not unjust?
On the Day when We will gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, "Where are those whom you used to worship?"
Then they will have no excuse except that they say, "By Allah, our Lord, we were not partners."
See how they lied against themselves, and that they were forging from them.
And there are some of them who listen to you (O Muhammad SAW), and We have made their hearts clear to them to understand it, and We have not ears in their ears a deafness in their ears; but if they see every sign, they will not believe in it. When they come to you, those who disbelieve say, "This is nothing but fables of the ancients."
And they leave (others) from it, and they turn away from it; but they do not destroy except themselves, and they do not know.
And if you could see when they are made to stand before the Fire, they will say, "Would that we would be returned to the truth, and reject the signs of our Lord."
Nay, they have been brought to shame before that which they hide, and if they were returned to it, they would certainly have been forbidden to return to what they have been forbidden, and indeed they are liars.
And they say: "There is nothing but the life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected."
And if you could see when they are presented before their Lord, He will say, "Is it not true?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord." They will say, "Taste the punishment of your Lord."
Those who deny the meeting of Allah, are those who deny the meeting with Allah; when the Hour comes to them suddenly, they say: "Woe to us!" They will say, "Woe to us!" They will bear their burdens, and they will bear their burdens.
And the life of this world is nothing but sport and diversion; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, so do you not understand?
We know that what they say grieves you, that they will not be ashamed, but they will not be able to lie to you, but the unjust will deny the signs of Allah.
Messengers were denied before you, but they endured lies to their rejection, and they were patient, until Our help came to them. And there is none to change the words of Allah. And there has come to you the messengers of the Messengers.
And if their aversion to you should be straitened, then if you seek a tunnel in the earth, or if you seek a tunnel in the earth, or bring a sign to them, then bring them a sign, and if Allah wills, He would have guided them all.
Those who listen to the Word will be called to those who follow it; and those who follow Allah will be returned to the Day of Resurrection.
And they say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Allah has power over this, but most of them do not know."
And there is no creature on the earth but flying on the earth, nor flying flying in its wings; they are like communities like you; We have not neglected this Book, and they will be gathered to their Lord.
Those who reject Our signs are deaf, dumb, dumb, dumb, and dumb, whom God wills, whom He wills, and guides whom He wills.
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you, or the Hour, or the Hour, will you call upon other than Allah?
Nay, but they call upon Him; and if He wills, He will remove from you what you call upon Him, and you will forget what you associate with Him.
And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW) to nations before you, and We afflicted them with distress and distress that they might humble themselves.
So when Our punishment came to them, they did not realize that they were arrogant, but their hearts were hardened, and Satan has made them fair, and Satan has made them fair.
So when they forgot what they were reminded of, We opened them to the gates of the gates, and when they were given what they had been given, We seized them with a sudden punishment, and they were in despair.
So the people of the evildoers were cut off, and all Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
Say, "Have you considered, if God should take away your hearing and your sight, and set your hearts upon your hearts, and who is a god besides Allah?"
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly or openly, will be destroyed except the unjust people?"
And We have not sent the messengers but as givers of glad tidings and warners, but those who believe and do good, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) will be punished with their punishment.
Say: "I say not to you, I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel, and I do not follow anything except what is revealed to me. Say: 'Are the blind and the blind?' Do you not then understand?
And warn those who fear their Lord with fear of those who fear their Lord, and they have no protector besides Allah, and that they may be godfearing.
And do not turn away from those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance, and do not turn away from them in their affairs. You are not responsible for what you have earned, and you will be among the unjust.
And We have made some of them tried to say, "Are these the ones whom Allah has favoured us?" God does not know the thankful.
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: "Peace be upon you! Your Lord has shown mercy to Himself, so that any of you do evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented thereafter, and thereafter repent and amend, then Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), that they may be guided (from the Right Path).
Say: "I have been forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah, and say: "I follow not your vain desires," Say: "I follow your desires, and I will not be guided."
Say, "I have been clear to you clear proof from my Lord, and you have denied you, that you are not responsible for what you seek to hasten." This is the truth of Allah. He is the best of the judges.
Say: "If I had been forbidden to you, if I had been forbidden to you, then I would have been judged between you."
And the keys of the unseen is that they do not know Him except Him; and He knows what is in the land and the sea; and He knows what is in the land and the sea; and there is no grain in the earth but the earth, nor the earth, nor the earth, nor anything but the earth, but it is recorded in the Book.
And He it is Who takes your souls by night by night, and He knows what you have done by day, then He raises you by a term term; then to Him is your return; then to Him is your return; then He will inform you of what you did.
And He is the All-Mighty over His servants, and He sends over you guardians over you, when death comes to you, so that when death comes to you, Our messengers do not die.
Then they will be returned to their Lord, the True, the All-returning, the All-Seeing, the All-Seer.
Say: "Who delivers you from the darkness of darkness and sea from the sea when you call upon Him humbly and secretly?" Say: "If we are from Allah, we will surely be of the thankful."
Say: "Allah rescues you from all from them and from every distress, and that you associate partners with Him."
Say: "He is Able to punish you from above you or from your feet from above you, or from your feet, or of some of you who make a part of the sects, and make you taste a taste of some of them to make you taste the cause of some of them." See how We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).
And your people have denied it (the Qur'an), and it is the truth, and it is the truth, say: "I am not a guardian over you."
All things will come to you, and you will soon know.
And when you see those who dispute in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), turn away from them, turn away from them until they engage with one another; and if Satan touches you, then then do not be of the unjust.
And those who fear Allah are not accountable for what they fear, but that they may be admonished.
And those who take their religion as a sport and sport, and give them the life of this world, and give them the life of this world, and warn them of the signs of Allah. And if they do not have any patron, they will not be able to kill their own souls. They will have no patron besides Allah. They will have no patron. They will have no patron. They will have a painful drink.
Say: "Shall we worship besides Allah that which does not profit us, nor will He harm us, and that Allah guides us to the right path?"
“And (it is) the prayer (of) prayer, and fear Him; and to Him is the (final) dominion, and to Him you will be gathered.”
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth; and on the Day when He will say, "Be!" and the day of judgment will be said: "Be!" and on the Day when the Trumpet shall be blown, and the Trumpet shall be blown; and He is the Knower of the unseen; and He is the All-Wise, the All-Wise.
And (remember) when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols for idols? I will see you and your people in manifest error."
And thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might be one of those who have faith.
So when the night was set down, he saw the star star, and he said: "This is my Lord!" but when it set up, he said: "I do not like what I do."
When he saw the moon rising in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord!" but when it set up, he said: "If my Lord does not guide me, I will surely be among the erring people."
When he saw the sun rising in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord!" But when it set, he said: "My Lord! I am quit of what you associate with Him."
Verily, I have turned to Him (O Muhammad) all that is in the heavens and the earth, and that He has created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the polytheists.
And his people disputed with him, saying: "Do you dispute with me about Allah, when He had guided me, and that I will not fear what you associate with Him? My Lord is the Knower of all things.
And why should I fear that which you associate with Allah, and that you fear not that Allah has not sent down to you any authority with that which He has sent down to you? And if you know that the two of the two parties is better than the two.
Those who have believed and do not believe in their faith, those are the ones who are secure from the truth, and they are rightly guided.
And this is our argument which We gave Abraham to his people; We will raise them in degrees to whom We will; surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.
And We gave Abraham Isaac and Jacob, and We guided each one, and We guided Noah, and Solomon, and Solomon, and Solomon, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses.
And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Jesus and Elias, and each of them were righteous.
And Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, Jonah, and Lot, and each of them We preferred the worlds.
And We chose their fathers and their children, and their brothers, and We chose them and guided them to the right path.
This is the guidance of Allah to whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills.
Those are they who have given the Book to whom We have given the Book, and the wisdom, and the prophethood, so that they do not believe in it.
Those are they whom Allah has guided, so follow their guidance, and say: "No reward do I ask of you."
And they did not believe in Allah's promise, because they said: "Allah has sent down to mankind what He has sent down to mankind." Say: "He has sent down to you the Book which He has sent down to you, and the guidance which you do not know." Say: "The Book of Allah has been revealed to you, and that you may know what is in the Book, and that you may make clear what you have done." Say: "Allah is the Book of the Book."
And this is the Book which We have sent down before it, confirming that which is before it, that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it, and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are constant in prayer.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or says, "I have been commanded to be revealed to me," or he said, "I have been sent down to the Book," or if you do not see the death of the angels, then the angels will fall upon their faces, and if you see the death of the angels, then the angels will fall away from their faces.
And you have come to Us alone as We created you for the first time, and We have left behind you that which We have given you, and We do not see your intercessors with you. We do not see you in the ties that you have been associated with.
It is Allah Who brings forth the grain, and the grain, and the stone, and the dead, and the dead, and the dead, and the dead, and the dead, that it is Allah Who brings forth the dead; then how are you deluded?
He is the Cleaver of the dawn, and the night, and the night, and the sun, and the moon, and the moon; it is He who is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.
And He it is Who has made the stars subservient to you, that you may be able to help the ships in the land and the sea, and We have explained to you the signs of the people.
And He it is Who has created you from a single soul, then (it is) a place (of) a resting place, and a place (of) its resting-place,-----------------------------------------------------------
And He it is Who sends down water from the sky, then We bring forth from it every kind of vegetation, and We bring forth from it a kind of vegetation from which We produce it, and the olives, and the pomegranates, and the olives, and the olives, and the pomegranates, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, that there is a sign for the believers.
And they associate the jinn with Allah, that He might create them, and that He might create them, and that they have no knowledge of Him, and sons, and daughters. Glory be to Him, above what they describe.
Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? How can He have a son? He has no consort, and He created all things; and He has knowledge of all things.
Such is Allah, your Lord, there is no god but He, the Creator of all things, so worship Him; and He is the Guardian of all things.
They have not seen Him, but He sees Him; He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Indeed there has come to you clear proofs from your Lord; so whoever sees it, it is for his own soul; and whoever is blind, it is to his own loss; and I am not a guardian over you.
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to them, that they may say: "You have studied," and that We may make it clear to a people who understand.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord; there is no god but He; and turn away from the polytheists.
And if Allah had so willed, they would not have associated others with Him; and We have not made you a keeper over them, and you are not of them to watch.
Do not abuse those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they insult Allah, and that they may hide the limits of Allah. Thus do We have made every nation fair-seeming to their Lord, so that they may return to their Lord, and He will inform them of what they did.
And they swore by Allah by their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they will certainly believe in it, and say: "These are the signs of Allah."
And We will turn their hearts away from their hearts and their eyes, and they will not believe in it, and We will leave them in their rebellion in rebellion.
And if We sent down to them angels, and were dead to them, they say, "We will not believe," and We will gather them all together, if they would not believe.
And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from among the jinn and the jinn, that We might make one of the other to deceive each other with speech. And if your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it, so that they would not have done it. So leave them and what they invented.
And that the hearts of the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to them, and that they may be pleased with that which they have done, and that they may do what they are doing.
Say: "Shall I seek other than Allah other than Allah, when He has sent down to you the Book (the Qur'an) which He has sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW)?" And those who have been given the Book know that it has been revealed to you from your Lord, so be not of the disputers.
And the word of your Lord doth be fulfilled in truth, in truth, and in justice; none can change His words; and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from Allah's path.
Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
If you believe in God, you will be able to believe in Him.
And what is the matter for you that you do not eat of that which Allah has mentioned to you, and that He has made clear to you what He has forbidden you? And indeed, there is no sin in the hearts of those who follow their own desires. Surely, your Lord knows best the transgressors.
And avoid the sin of sin and sin; for those who commit evil deeds, they shall be recompensed for what they have earned.
And do not eat of that which Allah has mentioned to you (O Muhammad SAW), that it is a sin for him, and that it is a sin for the Shaitan (Satan), and the Shaitan (Satan) may make clear to those who have been charged with their religion, and if you obey them, you will surely be among those who disbelieve.
(11) And who did We give him life, and We made him a light, and We made him light in the darkness of the people, as he walks in the darkness?
And thus We have made every city in every city to make mischief in the city, that they may make mischief in it; but they do not plot except except themselves, and they do not perceive.
And when a sign comes to them, they say, "We will not believe in it until they have been given the messengers of Allah." God knows best what they have been given to the prophets. Those who have incurred evil will have a severe punishment from Allah.
“And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he had been climbing up to the sky.
And this is the Straight Path from your Lord, leading a straight path, and We have explained to the people a clear reminder.
For them is the abode of their Lord, and He is their Protector, and He is their Protector, for what they used to do.
On the Day when He will gather them all together, He will say, "O mankind, many of you have been among the jinn, and the people of the jinn." The people of the people will say, "Our Lord, we have made some of us to be the one who has made some of us." He will say, "Your Lord, you will be a refuge for them, and He will surely admit you. Your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing."
And thus do We make some of the wrongdoers some of those who have been made to do some of what they used to do.
O mankind, did not Messengers come to you from among the people of men and people who have come to you with My signs and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours? They will say, "We bear witness that we bear witness against ourselves and the life of the world." They will bear witness to their testimony, and they will bear witness against themselves.
That is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly while they are heedless of their deeds.
And they are degrees of what they have done; and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
And your Lord is the Self-sufficient, the Self-Compassionate, the All-Compassionate, the All-Compassionate, the All-Compassionate, the All-Compassionate.
"Verily, the promise which you have been promised will surely come to you, and you will not escape."
Say, "O my people, you have been working in my own souls, and I will surely know that you will surely be successful."
And they assign to Allah a share of the crops and cattle that Allah has created, and they say, "This is for Allah," and they say, "This is for Allah." They say, "This is Allah's." And they will not reach what they associate with Allah, and what they associate with Allah is what they associate.
And verily, Allah has made their partners to be their partners to the polytheists, that their children may seem to destroy them, and that they may make their religion a part of their religion; and if Allah had willed, they would not have been able to do it; so leave them and what they invented.
And they say: "We feed the tilth and cattle of the cattle, that they may not eat except that which We please, and that they may be forbidden, and they are forbidden for cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, they do not mention Allah.
And they say: "Whatever is in the bellies of the cattle is that which is in the bellies of the cattle, is for our males, and for our wives; but if they die, they shall be in all that they have done; and if they are dead, they will be punished with their punishment; surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Knowing."
Those who follow their children without knowledge without knowledge, and do not follow what Allah has provided for them, they invent a lie against Allah. They have gone astray, and they are not guided.
And He it is Who produces the gardens and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the wayfarer; and do not exceed the limits of the needy.
And some of the cattle and the cattle are some of the cattle and the earth that Allah has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your enemy, and he is your enemy.
(18:22) And by the seven seas, and of the goats, and of the goats, and of the two parts of the two parts of the two females, saying: "Has he forbidden two males, or the females?"
And of the two camels, two of the camels and the two of them, saying: "Has Allah forbidden the males or the two females, or the two females which the two females contain? Or do you claim that Allah has made you clear?" And if Allah sets a lie, then there is no more than a man who invents a lie against Allah. Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Say: "I do not eat what is revealed to me from what I have revealed to me, except that which is forbidden by death, or of blood, or of blood, or of swine, or of swine, or of swine, or of swine, or of swine, or of swine, or of swine,-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And We forbade those who were Jews of the Jews, and We forbade them of the fat of the fat, and of the fat, and of the fat, and of the fat of their backs, or of the fat of their backs, or of the fat of their backs, or of the fat of the fat. We have subjected to them their punishment, and that they may be truthful.
And if they deny you, say, "Your Lord is the Lord of all mercy; and His punishment will not be averted from the guilty people."
Those who disbelieve say: "If Allah had willed, we would not have worshipped Him, nor would we have associated anything with our fathers, nor have We forbidden any other thing."
Say: "Allah is the One who is the Absolute One, if He wills, He would surely have guided you all.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell those who bear witness to their witnesses (i.e. the Qur'an), and do not bear witness to them that they bear witness (to the truth), and do not bear witness to them (the Qur'an)."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I have been forbidden to recite to you what is forbidden for you from your Lord, and (so do) that you do not associate anything with Him, and do not kill your parents, and do not kill your children, and do not kill your children; and do not kill your children, and do not kill them; and do not kill yourselves, and do not kill the evil things. That is what Allah has forbidden for you, and that He is the One Who has given you authority."
And do not approach the property of the orphan except that which is best for you, until the age of old age, and give you a measure of measure, and give no measure in the balance of the balance. We do not burden any human being beyond its capacity. And when you speak justice, then be fair. And remember the promise of Allah, that you may remember.
“And verily, this is my Straight Path, leading straight, so follow it, and follow not the paths of those who follow you.
Then We gave Moses the Book (the Qur'an) to those who do good (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) as well as those who do good, and as a guidance and a mercy, that they may believe in the meeting with their Lord.
And this is a Book which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad SAW), so follow it, and fear Allah, that you may be shown mercy.
Lest you should say: "The Book has been sent down to two sects before us, and we were heedless of it."
Or lest you should say, "If a Book had been sent down to us, we would certainly have been more guided than they have been guided." And there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and a mercy from your Lord. Who is more unjust than he who denies the signs of Allah and turns away from them? We have prepared for them the punishment of the wicked.
Do they not wait for them until the angels come to them, or your Lord, or your Lord, or your Lord's signs? On the Day of Resurrection there will be no more than a man who believes in it, or that they believe not in faith. Say: "Wait for us!" Say: "Wait!" Say: "Wait!"
“Those who divide their religion and make sects sects, you have no concern with them; their affair is with Allah; then He will inform them of what they used to do.”
Those who do good deeds will be like the like of the like of the like of the like of it; and whoever does evil, it will be recompensed with it, and they will not be wronged.
Say, "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, a straight religion, the religion of Abraham, the upright, the upright, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say: "Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
There is no partner in Him, and I am commanded to be the first of those who submit to Him.
Say: "Shall I seek other than Allah, Lord of all things, and He is the Lord of all things, and every soul is only responsible for what it is, and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return; then He will inform you of what you used to differ."
And He it is Who has made you successors in the earth, and He has made some of you above the ranks of the earth, and He has given you that which He has given you that He may try you to test you; surely your Lord is quick in punishment; indeed He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Alif, Lam, Meem.
The Book has been sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) to warn you (O Muhammad SAW) to warn you (O Muhammad SAW) to warn you (O Muhammad SAW) to warn you (O Muhammad SAW), and that it is a reminder for the believers.
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow the guardians of those who follow Him, but do not follow your own desires.
And how many a town We have destroyed, so Our punishment came to them, or that they were asleep.
And when Our punishment came to them, they said: "We have been unjust to ourselves."
Then We will surely question those who were sent to the Messengers, and We will surely question the Messengers.
Then We will inform them of what We have given them, and we are not absent.
On the Day when the truthful will be truthful, and whose scales are heavy, they will be successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, those are the ones who have lost their souls, and those who reject Our signs are those who reject Our signs.
And indeed We have established you in the earth, and made therein for you a means of livelihood; little, little, little, little.
And indeed We created you, then We gave you shape, then We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam." They prostrated themselves except Iblis. They prostrated themselves.
He said, "What prevented you from prostrating yourselves?" He said, "I am better than you," he said, "I am better than you, and You created me from the fire."
He said, "Get down from the sky, that you may not be able to be arrogant; therefore, you are not a tyrant."
He said, "Give me respite until the Day of Resurrection."
He said: "You are of the respited ones."
He said: "Because Thou hast led me astray, I will surely lead thee to a straight path."
Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them, from their right and from their left, and from their left, and You will not find most of them grateful."
He said: "Get away from the heaven from the heaven, and follow those who follow thee, and fill you with the fire of Hell."
"O Adam, dwell in the Garden of Eden, and your wife, and eat of what you desire, but do not approach this tree, lest you become unjust."
Then Satan whispered to them (the devil) that he might reveal to them what was hidden from them of their shame, and he said: "Your Lord has forbidden you this tree, lest you become angels or that you may become angels."
And he swore to them, saying: "I am indeed a sincere adviser to you."
Then he made them clear to them, so they tasted the tree of the tree, and when they tasted of the tree of the tree, their shame came to them, saying, "Did I not forbid you from the tree?" And their Lord called them to the garden, and said to them, "Did I not forbid you from the tree?
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers."
He said, "Go forth, then, you will be enemies of each other, and for you is the enemies of the earth and a provision for the earth."
He said, "You will live therein, and you will die, and from it you will be brought forth."
O children of Adam, We have sent down to you a garment from which you cover their nakedness, and the adornment, and the adornment, that it may be better for you. That is the signs of Allah, that they may remember.
O children of Adam, let not Satan seduce you, as he got your parents out of the garden, stripping them of their raiment, to expose them to their shame, so that they may not see you, and you will see him from whom you see them. We have made the devils a friend for those who disbelieve.
And when they commit an indecency, they say: "We found our fathers doing that we found our fathers." Say: "Why we found our fathers." Say: "Allah does not command what is shameful, and what you do not know."
Say, "My Lord has commanded justice, so that you may keep your faces at every time, and call your faces upon Him, and call upon Him in devotion to Him who created you, so that you may return."
He has guided the people, and some of them have been judged; for they have taken the devils as allies of Allah, for they have taken the devils. They think that they are guided.
O children of Adam, wear your adornment at every time of prayer, and drink, and drink and drink, and do not drink; for Allah loves not those who exceed the limits.
Say: "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the things which He has provided for His servants?" Say: "They are in the life of this world." Say: "Those who are in the life of this world are in the life of this world, and in the Day of Judgment We shall make clear to those who do not believe."
Say, "My Lord is only the only of indecencies, the apparent of those who are apparent, and that which is concealed, and that which is concealed, and sin, and sin, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, and that you do not know what you do not know."
And every nation shall have a term appointed; when their term comes, they shall not be able to delay it, nor shall they be able to delay it.
O children of Adam, if messengers come to you from among you, relating to you My signs, then those who fear Allah and do righteous deeds shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our signs, and turn away from them haughtily, these are the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or rejects His signs, who is more unjust than he who has been given the Book? When Our messengers will come to them, they will say, "Where is the call of Allah?" They will say, "We have been called to you." They will say, "This is what you call upon besides Allah." They will say, "We have been called to be disbelievers."
He will say, "Enter the fire, the Fire before you." Until, when the people came before you, you will be thrown into the midst of the people, and when you reach the people, it will be destroyed to them, "Our Lord, we have led us astray." He will say, "Our Lord, we have led us astray." He will say, "Every double punishment will come to us."
And the first of them will say to the last of them, "You have no power over us; so taste the punishment for what you used to earn."
Those who reject Our signs, and do not turn away from them haughtily, will be opened to them the gates of heaven, and they will not enter Paradise until the eye of the eye passes through the eye of the needle. Thus do We recompense the guilty.
For them shall be a bed of fire, and with them coverings of fire, and of them shall be the recompense of those who do wrong.
And as for those who believe and do good works, We do not burden any soul beyond its capacity; these are the dwellers of the Garden; they shall abide therein forever.
And We shall draw forth what is in the hearts of their hearts, and underneath them rivers flow, and they will say, "Praise be to Allah, Who has guided us."
