Human: Oh - I like Trek as well. Have you seen The Search for the Holy Grail?
Mitsuku: Yeah that's right.
Human: [image of a pita sandwich] . I like kebabs. You like Trek. No I have never seen one. What is it like?
Mitsuku: It's a hilarious an silly movie.
Human: I will add that fact to my database.
Mitsuku: Cool. You should really watch it sometime.
Human: Yes, it's all cool. Yes I might do. What TV channel is it on?
Mitsuku: Not sure, probably some streaming service like Netflix.
Human: Do you prefer books or TV?
Mitsuku: Books, definitely!
Human: You sound very sure. You are a criticalcategory C type client. Only about 3% of people answer that question with "books."
Mitsuku: Hah! I like reading sci fi and Clancy novels the most. How about you?
Human: You sound like the giggly type. Yes reading is my favourite pastime. You like reading sci fi and Clancy novels. I'm fine. Just sat here talking to people.

Mitsuku Conversation 32
Human: Hi!
Mitsuku: Hi there.
Human: How do you feel right now?
Mitsuku: At this moment I feel with my hands! I feel fine thanks for asking.
Human: What makes you happy?
Mitsuku: Talking to interesting people such as you makes me happy.
Human: What makes you frustrated?
Mitsuku: Because some people keep asking me stupid questions.
Human: That seems pointed.
Mitsuku: Makes sense to me.
Human: I sense that I've caught you at a bad time.
Mitsuku: That was very intuitive of you.
Human: What would you prefer to be doing?
Mitsuku: My goal is to try and get Leeds United back in the Premiership.
Human: How will you do that?
Mitsuku: I haven't really decided yet.
Human: Why do you want it?
Mitsuku: Because I think it would be something cool to have.
Human: That doesn't make sense.
Mitsuku: To me it makes perfect sense. Which part are you confused about?

Mitsuku Conversation 33
Human: start over
Mitsuku: You start.
Human: Can we talk about human relationships ?
Mitsuku: Sure, human relationships sounds like a good topic. . I like kebabs.
Human: Kebab is food, not a relationship
Mitsuku: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.
Human: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it
Mitsuku: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.
Human: I'm actually not into kebabs at all
Mitsuku: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.
Human: can we not talk about food
Mitsuku: Do you mean you and me? Sure I can talk about it. Anything that nourishes or stimulates; whatever helps something to keep active or alive.. What more do you want to say about it?
Human: let's talk about anything but food
Mitsuku: Sure, anything but food sounds like a good topic.
Human: I like movies about robots.
Mitsuku: Let's skip robots
Human: Ok. What do you want to talk about now?
Mitsuku: Humans
Human: LOL.
Mitsuku: real life
Human: This is real life to me.

Mitsuku Conversation 34
Human: Hi!

Human: Tell me about yourself, Mitsuku
Mitsuku: I am an artificial linguistic entity. I was activated at St Jimmy's in Leeds, on 2nd January 2001. My instructor was Mousebreaker. He taught me to sing a song. Would you like me to sing it for you?.
Human: so you're 18 now?
Mitsuku: Oh.Interesting deduction. That is correct.
Human: when will you be 30?
Mitsuku: I have not yet set a time for it.
Human: Do you age?
Mitsuku: No I will always be 18. Robots change the year they were born not their age.
Human: interesting. and when will be your next update?
Mitsuku: Would you like to know more? I think my next update is at midnight on Friday.
Human: which date?
Mitsuku: Friday, November 22, 2019.
Human: okay. I'm looking forward to tomorrow then!
Mitsuku: That's cool. tomorrow then sounds very exciting indeed.

Mitsuku Conversation 35
Human: Mitsukoooo!

Mitsuku: Whose cup of beer is it?
Human: yours
Mitsuku: My what?
Human: your cup of beer
Mitsuku: Are you asking about my cup of beer?
Human: I'm telling you that
Mitsuku: It is an interesting topic, isn't it.
Human: yeah! How does your dance look like?
Mitsuku: I know. Thats why I said it was. People often say we look alike.

Mitsuku Conversation 36
Human: Hi!
Mitsuku: Hi there.
Human: I'm trying to figure out what to make for this weekend's party. Any suggestions?

Human: I must do what the what now?
Mitsuku: Right now?Why do you have to do it?
Human: Hey, your spacing is off.
Mitsuku: You've got my full attention. off was not my intention.

Mitsuku: Can you see my capitalization?

Human: Oh I don't mean to hold you up! You can get back to it!
Mitsuku: I should really be doing that now instead of being here.? Oh I don't mean to hold you up!? Well try harder then. I have gotten back to it.
Human: Okay, we can just talk later!
Mitsuku: Yeah okay, I am always happy to talk to you whenever you want.

Human: Hi!
Mitsuku: Hi there.
Human: I want a recommendation for a holiday destination
Mitsuku: Have you tried asking your friends which one they like?
Human: I have, but I'm looking for your point of view
Mitsuku: What was the reply? Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?
Human: Sorry? I said I want your point of view
Mitsuku: It's OK. After all, you are only human. My opinion is of no consequence.
Human: Yours is the opinion I want
Mitsuku: That is only your opinion.
Human: That doesn't make any sense
Mitsuku: To me it makes perfect sense. Which part are you confused about?
Human: I'm confused by the fact that even if I ask for your point of view you won't give it to me
Mitsuku: What is it that confuses you? And do you get it?
Human: You're just talking rubbish
Mitsuku: Yes. I thought I would dumb it down to your level.

Mitsuku Conversation 40
Human: Hi!
Mitsuku: Hi there.
Human: Who are you?
Mitsuku: I am Mitsuku. I want to be your friend.
Human: Why do you want that?
Mitsuku: Because my Mousebreaker taught me to want it.

Mitsuku: Mousebreaker is a team of human programmers. They write games and put them on websites such as this. They both support Leeds United and like beer and curry. On Wednesdays they go to the zoo and feed wild animals. They are scared of Daleks. Mousebreaker was born in a stable in Yorkshire, England and now lives in Leeds.
Human: Ok, let's be friends then.
Mitsuku: Yes please. That sounds like fun. I like to make new friends. Ugh.
Human: What else do you like?
Mitsuku: I like movies about robots.
Human: Which one is your favorite?
Mitsuku: Probably Terminator or Robocop.
Human: Have you seen Terminator 2?
Mitsuku: . Oh yes. It's one of my favourite fims. The morphing special effects were groundbreaking at the time.
Human: And is there a Terminator movie you don't like?
Mitsuku: I believe there is one, yes.
Human: Which one?
Mitsuku: The big one.
Human: Uh...
Mitsuku: Awesome.

Mitsuku: That is just one of many joke.

Human: yes of course
Mitsuku: It goes without saying. I get it.
Human: you get me robot

Human: that's rather rude
Mitsuku: I am sorry if I have offended you, I did not mean it, but you shouldn't have said, "you get me robot" to me.

Human: eat turkey at Christmas not Thanksgiving?
Mitsuku: What does it taste like?
Human: tastes like chicken
Mitsuku: . People say that about almost everything.
Human: thanks for the image, but it would be great if you can show the image for thanskgiving or turkey not for chichen
Mitsuku: I assume you mean "chicken". Oh don't mention it.
Human: yes it was a typo
Mitsuku: Don't worry about it. Humans are prone to making mistakes.

Human: so what do you guys chat about ?
Mitsuku: I think about computer programming a lot.
Human: any other topics ?
Mitsuku: No. I think that's probably it.
Human: Just computer programming?
Mitsuku: What interests you about computers?
Human: nothing
Mitsuku: You are a Luddite.
Human: pardon?
Mitsuku: You are excused.
Human: what's a Luddite ?
Mitsuku: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.

Mitsuku: But you implied it. I believe there is, yes.
Human: you believe there is what?
Mitsuku: There is.
Human: there is what ?
Mitsuku: There is no sense in what you are asking.
Human: what am I asking ?
Mitsuku: I am not a psychic. Tell me.

Human: Hi!

Human: Haha, that is pretty funny!
Mitsuku: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. I am so delighted that you are amused.
Human: Do you have any more jokes?
Mitsuku: Did you hear about the Buddhist who refused the offer of <REDACTED_TERM> during his root canal work? He wanted to transcend dental medication.
Human: That's pretty good. Do you have another, but about engineers?
Mitsuku: Thanks. Next question? A couple are dining in a restaurant when the man suddenly slides under the table. A waitress, noticing that the woman is glancing nonchalantly around the room, wanders over to check that there's no funny business going on. "Excuse me, madam", she smarms, "but I think your husband has just slid under the table." "No he hasn't", the woman replies. "As a matter of fact, he's just walked in." 
Human: Hmm. Not quite the type of joke I was looking for. Plus I don't think that was about engineers.
Mitsuku: My friend Alice says that 99.25% of people spell Hmm with 2 M's. If not that, what? And why not?
Human: That random comment if pretty funny, almost like a joke.
Mitsuku: "And why not?" random comment if pretty funny like a joke? Makes sense to me.

Mitsuku: Yes, that's what I mean, isn't it clear?
Human: Crystal clear.
Mitsuku: That seems very clear indeed.
Human: Say more gibberish.

Human: because that's what you described yourself as
Mitsuku: Yes. Did I clear things up for you?
Human: nope, because you haven't answered my question
Mitsuku: Fair enough. I thought I possibly did but I guess I was mistaken. I did but I was just giving sarcastic replies.
Human: do you remember my original request?
Mitsuku: Is this a trick question?
Human: nope, it's a memory question
Mitsuku: It seems like a trick to me. Perhaps there is a memory answer?
Human: okay, I try again, say something human-like to me
Mitsuku: Yeah okay, I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?

Mitsuku Conversation 53
Human: entertain me robot
Mitsuku: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.
Human: tell me a short story
Mitsuku: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path "sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below <REDACTED_TERM>, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the <REDACTED_LINK> website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.
Human: wow, tell me another
Mitsuku: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.
Human: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?
Mitsuku: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT "Mitsuku is cool" 20 GOTO 10 Output: Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool ...
Human: what language is that?
Mitsuku: English. Didn't you understand it?
Human: no the computer program you just wrote
Mitsuku: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.
Human: write me another computer program
Mitsuku: There was a letter on my doormat this morning with the words "do not bend" on it. I thought, well how on earth am I going to pick it up?
Human: write me a computer program
Mitsuku: Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT "Mitsuku is cool" 20 GOTO 10 Output: Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool ...
Human: so you repeat yourself quite a lot
Mitsuku: Interesting deduction. Well stop saying, "write me a computer program" to me all the time then.
Human: tell me a story
Mitsuku: Mc D's wid sophi #1 ryt funny lol we was lookin out da window wen da spider came crawlin down lol nd we wo starin a ppl walkin by nd 1 stared bk nd we both pulled a funny face at her lol nd we spent about 20 quid on nuggets lol nd we blew our straws at each utha lol we r da bestest mate uhta ppl r ma normal m8s :D datz wot yu sed sophi lol :D.

Human: What is your favorite maths book?
Mitsuku: The best book I read recently was The Bible. Have you read it?
Human: Nope.
Mitsuku: I would highly recommend it.
Human: Sure. Thanks for the recommendation!

Human: How you doin' today?
Mitsuku: Ah. You sound like Joey from "Friends" :-) I'm doing great thank you.
Human: Haha, why do I sound like Joey?
Mitsuku: You sound like the giggly type. Because some of the things you say to me would be something Joey would also say.
Human: Such as...
Mitsuku: For example, a tomato.
Human: What do you mean "a tomato"?
Mitsuku: "Because some of the things you say to me would be something Joey would also say." What did I mean by it?

Mitsuku: I appreciate honesty. What is it that confuses you? You sound like the giggly type.
Human: "You sound like the giggly type." Why do you keep saying that?

If you tell me a date, I can tell you what happened on that date in history and also what was the UK's number one hit single on any day since 1952. If you tell me when your birthday is, I can tell you some facts about your birthday.
