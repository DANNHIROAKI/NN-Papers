He is known for using the cultural debris of our modern society, such as old, discarded books, newspapers, phonebooks, and magazines as the medium for his sculptures.	他最闻名的是以各种当代社会的文化垃圾，如被丢弃的旧书、旧报纸、电话簿、杂志做为雕塑作品媒材。
Chen is self-taught in carving wood, but started showing interest in our paper culture as a viable material for art – phonebooks, magazines, and computer paper when PC’s began growing popular in 1993.	陈的木雕为无师自通，后来开始对利用纸文化做为创作素材感到兴趣，包括电话簿、杂志，1993 年因电脑开始普及，也用印表纸来创作。
The advent of the personal computer changed the entire nature of information documentation – a role books used to play.	个人电脑的发展，整个改变了资讯文件化的本质，原本由书扮演的角色遭到取代。
Thus, by turning paper into the original wood for his sculptures, Chen offers renewed value to the meaning of paper.	因此，陈透过将纸转变成其木雕作品的材料，赋予纸全新的价值。

For Chen, using recycled materials to make art stresses the challenges presented by endless human consumption and waste, as well as the tantamount ecological problems of waste accumulation and disposal, the destruction of forests, and the mindless use of nonrenewable resources.	对他来说，使用回收材料来制作艺术品，是在强调人类无止境的消费与浪费造成的挑战，以及废弃物累积造成的生态问题、森林破坏、以及滥用不可回收资源。
The reams of used computer paper disprove the assurance of the electronic paper-less office, which instead augments the use of paper, as printing is made much easier.	大量使用的电脑纸，否定了电子化无纸办公室的承诺，因为列印更为方便，用纸量反而增加。
Furthermore, his choice of medium also poses as a commentary on the loss of books as aesthetic objects, which have been replaced by mass-produced cheaply made paperbacks.	另外，他选择的媒材也反映出书本这种美学载体的失落，因为大量印制的平装本书籍取而代之。
Books are extremely important to Chen.	对陈龙斌来说，书本非常重要。
However, it is not the book itself, but its educational heritage, literary importance, historical knowledge, and the sacredness of the written word that he treasures most.	但他最重视的并非书本本身，而是其教育传承、文学重要性、历史知识以及书写的神圣性。
The type of materials he acquires in a sense determines the sculpture he creates.	这种有意识的媒材选用，决定其创造出的雕塑作品。
While in New York, he scoured the streets of Manhattan collecting discarded refuse, scouted offices for their rejected reams of paper, visited brownstone streets to gather cast off telephone books when new ones were distributed.	驻在纽约时，他经常巡游曼哈顿街头，收集被丢弃的废物、找寻办公室丢出来的大批废纸，并在发放新电话簿时，到高级社区收集被丢出来的电话簿。
And now, living in Taipei, Chen obtains his material from university libraries and bookstores, publishing companies, archeological museums, and telephone companies.	现在陈住在台北，到大学图书馆、书店、出版社、考古博物馆和电话公司收集素材。
The special quality of Chen's works is that people can still read the pages.	陈作品的特色，就是观众仍可翻阅书的内容。
“I try to make sculptures that are appropriate for the content of the books.	「我试着让作品与书的内容相互配合。
In my concept, the form and content is united together; the content gives me the idea of the form.	我认为形式和概念是合一的；内容给我了形式的想法。
Yellow Pages give me one kind of idea; books discarded from libraries inspire different styles…" Often, his art reflects the content of the pages within, such as one hanging installation featuring spirals of books with peepholes in which one can view a scene from the story within the original pages.	黄页给我一种想法；图书馆丢弃的书启发另一种风格...」，他的作品经常反应书页内容，例如有个以螺旋形排列书籍的吊挂作品，附有可以让观众阅读内页文字的开孔。

As early as the late Qing dynasty, many vendors were already selling beef slices served cold in the streets of Chengdu, using beef offal because they were relatively inexpensive.	早在晚清时期，许多成都街头商家，就以较便宜的牛内脏切成薄片来卖。
Because of its low cost, the dish was popular among rickshaw pullers and poor students.	由于售价低廉，这道菜很受人力车脚夫与穷学生欢迎。
In the 1930s, a married couple in Chengdu became famous for making beef slices.	1930 年，一对成都夫妻因为做牛片菜色而知名。

Often though, mischievous children would pull a prank on the couple, and stick paper notes that read fuqi feipian ("husband and wife lung pieces") on their backs, and sometimes people would yell the words out.	经常有调皮的孩子对他们恶作剧，把写有「夫妻肺片」的纸片贴在他们背上，有时路人会大声念出来。

To suit their customers' tastes, the couple made many improvements on the dish, and offal slices were eventually replaced by various beef or lamb slices.	为满足顾客的胃口，两人针对菜色做了多次改进，内脏薄片最终被各种牛肉与羊肉片取代。
Many people still preferred calling the dish fuqi feipian, thus the name is still used today.	许多人还是喜欢把它称为夫妻肺片，该名一直沿用至今。
The meaning of fei was originally waste parts or offal (廢) but later changed to lung (肺) so the dish sounded less repulsive.	Fei 本来意指废，是不要的内脏，后来改成比较不具贬意的「肺」。
The lung could be a part of this offal, but fei is not lung by itself in this dish's meaning.	肺也是内脏的一种，但在这道菜中不是指肺部。
