Ancillary files (code, data) for:

Berman, Fischbacher, Inverso, Scellier (2021),
"Vacua of dyonic SO(8) supergravity"

The code files in this directory should be thought of as somewhat ad-hoc Python
scripts that produce the artefacts for the paper, rather than proper software
components. As such, they may use questionable techniques (such as: executing
subshell commands via os.system(), writing data to /tmp, relying on global state
of matplotlib.pyplot, etc.) that one should not imitate in library-quality code.
