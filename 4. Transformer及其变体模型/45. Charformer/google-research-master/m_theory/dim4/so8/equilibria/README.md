# SO(8) Supergravity Equilibria

## SO8_SOLUTIONS.csv

This table lists all the 194 known solutions of de Wit - Nicolai N=8 D=4
SO(8)-gauged model, i.e. the 192 solutions from
https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00207, plus the two further solutions described in
https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10969.
The format is: potential,stationarity_violation,coord0,...,coord69.

## SO8C_PI8_SOLUTIONS.csv

This table lists solutions for the omega-deformed "dyonic SO(8)"
supergravity for omega=pi/8. This is based on implementing omega as
in (2.20) of: https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6219
This list might still have omissions.
The format is:
tag,potential,stationarity_violation,coord0,...,coord69.
