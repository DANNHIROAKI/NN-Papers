# Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the SMUG saliency method as proposed in the paper [Scaling Symbolic Methods using Gradients for Neural Model Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16322), **ICLR 2021**. SMUG combines gradient-based methods with symbolic techniques to generate explanations for a Neural Network's predictions.

# Dependencies
* python>=3.5
* ipykernel>=5.5.0
* numpy>=1.19.4
* saliency==0.1.2
* scikit-image>=0.18.1
* scikit-learn>=0.24.1
* scipy>=1.6.0
* tensorflow>=2.4.1
* tensorflow-datasets>=4.2.0
* tensorflow-estimator>=2.4.0
* tensorflow-hub>=0.11.0
* z3-solver==4.8.8

> **_NOTE:_**  Avoid later versions of z3-solver as we observe performance issues with them.

# Usage

1. Download the repository.
   * `git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none  --sparse https://github.com/google-research/google-research.git`
   * `cd google-research`
   * `git sparse-checkout init --cone`
   * `git sparse-checkout set smug_saliency`

2. Run the following commands to create a virtual environment called `smug` inside `smug_saliency`, install the dependencies, and ensure that all the tests pass.
   * `chmod +x smug_saliency/run.sh`
   * `./smug_saliency/run.sh`

3. Notebook examples.
   * Run the following commands to add `smug` kernel to jupyter notebook's list of kernels and launch jupyter notebook. 
      * `cd smug_saliency`
      * `source smug/bin/activate`
      * `ipython kernel install --user --name=smug`
      * `jupyter notebook`

   * [**image_saliency.ipynb**](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/smug_saliency/image_saliency.ipynb) shows how to run SMUG on CNN models for image saliency. In the notebook we demonstrate how to load an [inception model (v1 and v3)](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim), configure hyperparameters for SMUG, and generate saliency maps. Our paper used a slightly different variant of the inception v1 model (without batch norm), so visualizations and results may differ.

   * [**text_saliency.ipynb**](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/smug_saliency/text_saliency.ipynb) shows how to run SMUG on text models for text saliency. In the notebook we train a 1D CNN model on [beer reviews dataset](http://people.csail.mit.edu/taolei/beer/), configure hyperparameters for SMUG, and generate saliency maps.
