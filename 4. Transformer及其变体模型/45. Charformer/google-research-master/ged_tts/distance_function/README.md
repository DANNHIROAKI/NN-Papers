## Multi-scale spectrogram-based generalized energy distance

This implementation was used for speech synthesis experiments in "A Spectral
Energy Distance for Parallel Speech Synthesis" by Alexey A. Gritsenko,
Tim Salimans, Rianne van den Berg, Jasper Snoek and Nal Kalchbrenner.

For details see function `ged(wav_fake1, wav_fake2, wav_real)` in
`spectral_ops.py`.
