The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on 17 December 1997.	「網路日誌」(weblog) 一詞是由 Jorn Barger 於 1997 年 12 月 17 日創造出來。
The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.	簡短版的「網誌 (blog，或譯為部落格)」則是由 Peter Merholz 創造出來。他在 1999 年的 4 月或 5 月在其部落格「Peterme.com」的側邊攔將「weblog」拆解成「we」和「blog」，想開個小玩笑。
Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.	沒過多久，Pyra Labs 公司的 Evan Williams 將「blog」用來當作名詞和動詞 (「to blog」意即「編輯或張貼某人的網誌內容」)，並且想出了「blogger」(部落客) 一詞來和 Pyra Labs 的部落客產品相連結，引領這些詞彙風行全球。
Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists, and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).	在經營部落格成為顯學之間就已經有出現了許多不同形式的數位社群，包括 Usenet、專營線上商業服務的的 GEnie、位元資訊交換 (BIX)，以及早年的 CompuServe、電子郵件清單和電子佈告欄系統 (BBS)。
In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running conversations with "threads".	到了 1990 年代，網路論壇軟體以「討論串」建立了持續談論的對話形式。
Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard".	討論串為在虛擬「留言板」上依個別主題相互連結成串的訊息。
From 14 June 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What’s New" list of new websites, updated daily and archived monthly.	馬賽克通訊公司 (Mosaic Communications Corporation) 從 1993 年 6 月 14 日開始維護其「What’s New」新建網站清單，定期每日更新且每月建檔封存。
The page was accessible by a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web browser.	該清單頁面可以透過按下 Mosaic 網路瀏覽器中的「What's New」按鈕前往。
The earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web site created in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured a blog in a section called "Online Diary".	最早期的商業部落格實例出現在 Ty, Inc. 公司於 1995 年首度建立的企業對消費者 (B2C) 商務網站上，主打名為「線上日誌」的部落格專區。
The entries were maintained by featured Beanie Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.	網站訪客會在每月票選出特級豆豆娃娃 (Beanie Babies)，負責維護部落格項目。
The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives.	現代的部落格是由線上日誌演變而來。當時的人們會在日誌中記錄個人生活中各種大小事的流水帳。
Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers.	這些作者大多稱呼自己為日記作者、日誌作家或日誌寫手。
Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle.	Justin Hall 從 1994 年開始寫作個人部落格，當時他還在就讀斯沃斯莫爾學院。他和 Jerry Pournelle 都是公認的元老級部落客。
Dave Winer's Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs.	Dave Winer 的《編撰新聞》(Scripting News) 也被譽為網誌界的長青樹。
The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net News on their web site from 1996.	澳洲的《網路指南》(Netguide) 雜誌從 1996 年開始維護自家網站上的《網路日報》(Daily Net News)。
Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites, mostly in Australia.	《網路日報》負責運作新網站的連結與提供每日評論，其中大多數為澳洲網站。
Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994.	《穿戴式無線網路攝影機》(Wearable Wireless Webcam) 是另一個元老級部落格。這是於 1994 年創立的線上共享日誌，可透過穿戴式電腦和 EyeTap 智慧眼鏡裝置將數位影片和數位照片即時傳送到網站，並結合文字分享個人生活。
This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters.	這種結合了實拍影片和文字的半自動部落格實作在當時被稱為「逆向監視」(sousveillance)，而且像這樣的日誌內容也會用來在法律訴訟中做為證據。
Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.	在人們普遍使用「部落格」一詞之前，其實有些早期的部落客 (比如從 1997 年開始經營《厭世妖姬》(The Misanthropic Bitch) 的部落客) 會稱呼自己的線上寫作內容為「小誌」(zine)。
Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites.	早期的部落格就只是在一般網站上使用手動更新的元件。
In 1995, the "Online Diary" on the Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available.	1995 年，當時還沒有任何部落格程式，Ty, Inc. 公司網站上的「線上日誌」是採手動方式產出與更新內容。
Posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text based HTML code using FTP software in real time several times a day.	一天要使用好幾次 FTP 軟體來手動即時更新 HTML 文字編碼，讓貼文以反向時序呈現。
To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day.	對使用者來說，這樣會讓日記看起來猶如生活實況，每天都會新增多篇文章。
At the beginning of each new day, new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file, and the start of each month, diary entries were archived into its own folder which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month.	每一天的第一件事就是手動將新的日記文章編碼匯入新的 HTML 檔案，然後在每個月的一開始將日記文章封存到專屬資料夾內。資料夾中收藏了該月份每一天的個別 HTML 頁面。
Then menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site.	接著會手動更新網站上所有內含最近日記文章連結的選單。
This text-based method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later.	這種運用文字編碼來整理上千個檔案的方式，成為往後部落格樣式的定義基礎，並為數年之後研發出來的部落格軟體所用。
The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger and less technically-inclined population.	電子和軟體工具與時俱進，有助於產出與維護以反向時序張貼的網頁文章，讓更多對於相關技術並不熟悉的民眾得以順利透過程序發表文章。
Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today.	最後，我們如今所熟悉且特有的線上部落格發表型態，於焉誕生。
For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging".	例如，使用某些瀏覽器軟體來「寫部落格」，現在已蔚為典型。
Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, on regular web hosting services, or run using blog software.	部落格可以交託給專門的定期網路託管服務，或是使用部落格軟體來經營。
An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.	部落格越來越受到重視，並於 2002 年迎來早期的里程碑，當時有許多部落客都在關注美國參議院多數黨領袖 Trent Lott 的發言。
Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president.	Lott 參議員為擁護美國參議員 Strom Thurmond 的派系成員，他盛讚 Thurmond 參議員為能讓美國更加茁壯強大的總統人選。
Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign.	Lott 的批評者則將這些言論視為他默許 Thurmond 於 1948 年競選總統時主張的種族隔離政策。
This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers.	這項觀點在部落客挖掘出來的文件和訪談影片中得到進一步證實。
(See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.)	(請參閱 Josh Marshall 的《論點備忘錄》(Talking Points Memo) 部落格。)
Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.	雖然 Lott 是在有媒體在場的公開場合發言，主流媒體卻對他的爭議性言論隻字未提，直到有部落格爆料這件事。
Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.	在部落格推波助瀾之下，這場政治危機迫使 Lott 卸下多數黨領袖一職。
Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the "Rathergate" scandal.	同樣，部落格也是讓「拉瑟門」(Rathergate) 醜聞攤上檯面的一大功臣。
To wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show 60 Minutes) that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's military service record.	事情是這樣的：(電視新聞主播) 丹拉瑟 (在 CBS 電視台的《60 分鐘》節目上) 公開了幾份文件，其內容與先前眾所周知的布希總統服役紀錄有所矛盾。
Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view.	有些部落客宣稱這些文件均屬偽造，並提出證據和論述來支持自身看法。
Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see Little Green Footballs).	結果，CBS 電視台為其報導技巧欠缺專業素養公開致歉 (請參閱《小巧綠足球》(Little Green Footballs) 部落格)。
Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.	有許多部落客將這件醜聞視為大眾媒體接受部落格的起始點。媒體會將部落格當成新聞來源、意見表述以及施加政治壓力的方法。
The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination.	在這些事件的影響之下，部落格成為更具可信度的新聞傳播媒介。
Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead.	雖然部落客經常會被當成受黨派操弄的輿論工具，有時候卻能在主流媒體不得不遵從上級指示時，搶先讓關鍵資訊曝光。
More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.	不過，新建立的部落格反而更常會對主流媒體已經發佈的新聞來做出回應。
Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis.	與此同時，有越來越多各界專家開設部落格，讓部落格成為深度分析的資料來源。
In Russia, some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official, overwhelmingly pro-government media.	在俄國，有些政論部落客開始挑戰影響力鋪天蓋地的官媒和親政府媒體。
Bloggers such as Rustem Adagamov and Alexei Navalny have many followers and the latter's nickname for the ruling United Russia party as the "party of crooks and thieves" has been adopted by anti-regime protesters.	Rustem Adagamov 和 Alexei Navalny 都是有許多人追蹤的部落客，後者還把執政的統一俄羅斯黨稱為「騙子和小偷黨」，反政府的示威團體後來也採用了這個綽號。
This led to the Wall Street Journal calling Navalny "the man Vladimir Putin fears most" in March 2012.	這讓《華爾街日報》(Wall Street Journal) 於 2012 年 3 月將 Navalny 冠上「普丁最害怕的男人」的稱號。
By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as political consultants, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming.	到了 2004 年，部落格逐漸躋身主流媒體行列，政治顧問、通訊社和候選人紛紛開始使用部落格做為拓展人脈和形塑意見的工具。
Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source.	政治人物和候選人會成立部落格來針對戰爭及其他議題表達意見，鞏固了部落格做為新聞來源的角色定位。
(See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK's Labour Party's MP Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents.	(請見 Howard Dean 和 Wesley Clark)。就連平時不常主動舉辦競選活動的政治人物 (比如英國勞工黨籍國會議員 Tom Watson) 都開始成立部落格，和選民密切聯繫
In January 2005, Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people "could not ignore": Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.	2005 年 1 月，《財富」雜誌列出商業人士「不可忽視」的八名部落客：Peter Rojas、Xeni Jardin、Ben Trott、Mena Trott、Jonathan Schwartz、Jason Goldman、Robert Scoble 和 Jason Calacanis。
Israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog.	以色列是設立政府官方部落格的前幾個國家之一。
Under David Saranga, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web 2.0 initiatives, including an official video blog and a political blog.	以色列外交部在 David Saranga 的帶領之下積極採用 Web 2.0 技術開創新局，包括設立官方影音部落格和政治部落格。
The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference.	外交部也透過推特針對與哈馬斯組織之間的戰爭舉行微型部落格記者會，由 Saranga 使用簡短的文字訊息在全球直播的記者會中回答大眾媒體提問。
The questions and answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country's official political blog.	問答內容後來都張貼在國家的官方政治部落格《IsraelPolitik》上面。
The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments.	部落格對於主流媒體的影響，也已經得到政府認可。
In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area.	2009 年，美國有多家報業公司申請破產，新聞產業頓時一片愁雲慘霧，結果導致在同一發行區域相互競爭的報紙數量減少。
Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government.	坊間開始有人議論著報業是否能成為聯邦政府推出振興方案的受惠者。
U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying "if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”.	美國總統歐巴馬承認部落格的社會影響力越來越大，他說：「如果新聞全都奉部落格為圭臬、所有意見陳述都缺乏嚴謹的事實查證、斷章取義的行為四處可見，那麼人們到最後就只會相互叫囂謾罵，難以充分理解彼此的想法。」
Between 2009 and 2012, an Orwell Prize for blogging was awarded.	在 2009 年至 2012 年間，曾頒發過專屬於部落格的奧威爾獎。
Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in participatory journalism, are amateur journalists, and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in mainstream media organizations.	有許多部落客 (尤其是身為參與式新聞一份子的部落客) 是業餘的新聞工作者，也因此他們會將自己和在主流媒體組織工作的專業記者及編輯區分開來。
Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online, rather than via a TV station or newspaper, either as an add-on to a traditional media presence (e.g., hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper), or as their sole journalistic output.	其他部落客則是媒體從業人員，會在線上而非電視台或報紙上發表個人想法。他們有人會把部落格當成傳統媒體 (如主持廣播節目或在報紙上寫專欄) 的附加空間，有人會當成唯一的新聞發聲管道。
Some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" of media "gatekeepers" and pushing their messages directly to the public.	有些機構和組織會把部落格視為「繞過媒體守門人審查」的方法，能夠將它們的訊息直接傳遞給普羅大眾。
Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list.	同時，有許多主流媒體的新聞記者也在寫自己的部落格—根據 CyberJournalist.net 網站的新聞部落格清單 (J-blog list) 顯示，數量已經遠遠超過 300 個。
The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.	目前已知第一個出現在新聞網站上的部落格創建於 1998 年 8 月，當時《夏洛特觀察報》(The Charlotte Observer) 的 Jonathan Dube 創建了記錄邦妮颶風動態的部落格。
Some bloggers have moved over to other media.	有些部落客已經遷移到其他媒體平台。
The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: Duncan Black (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit), Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos), Alex Steffen (Worldchanging), Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette), Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com), and Ezra Klein (Ezra Klein blog in The American Prospect, now in the Washington Post).	下列部落客 (及其他人) 有在廣播電台和電視台上出現：Duncan Black (他的筆名 Atrios 廣為人知)、Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit)、Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos)、Alex Steffen (Worldchanging)、Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette)、Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com)，以及 Ezra Klein (原為《美國展望》(The American Prospect) 雜誌的 Ezra Klein 部落格，現已移至《華盛頓郵報》(Washington Post))。
In counterpoint, Hugh Hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.	Hugh Hewitt 則反其道而行，成為大眾媒體從業人員轉換方向的典範。他藉由自已具有影響力的部落客身分來增加「舊媒體」的觸及人數。
Similarly, it was Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online blog articles that captured Surgeon General of the United States Richard Carmona's attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host Lisa Tolliver and Westchester Emergency Volunteer Reserves-Medical Reserve Corps Director Marianne Partridge.	同樣，當年美國醫務總監 Richard Carmona 當年就是注意到了《廣播及線上緊急整備與安全提示》(Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online) 部落格上的文章，並大力讚揚由談話節目主持人 Lisa Tolliver 和西徹斯特郡緊急醫療志願後備軍醫療後備隊隊長 Marianne Partridge 共同主持的相關廣播節目。
Blogs have also had an influence on minority languages, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in Gaelic languages.	部落格也影響了少數語言，讓散居各地的母語人士和學習者得以齊聚一堂，其中蓋爾語的相關部落格尤具成效。
Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.	少數語言的發表內容 (往往在經濟層面無以為繼) 可以透過平價的部落格寫作方式來找到閱聽眾。
There are examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti, Jessica Cutler, ScrappleFace.	以下列舉幾位將自己的部落格文章集結出版的部落客：Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti、Jessica Cutler、ScrappleFace。
Blog-based books have been given the name blook.	將部落格內容集結出版的書籍被稱作「部落格書」(blook)。
A prize for the best blog-based book was initiated in 2005, the Lulu Blooker Prize.	專門表揚最佳部落格書的「Lulu 部落格書獎」於 2005 年開始頒發。
However, success has been elusive offline, with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs.	然而，線上的成功卻不保證線下也能獲得佳績，這類書籍的銷售熱度有許多都比不上部落格本身的人氣。
The book based on Julie Powell's blog "The Julie/Julia Project" was made into the film Julie & Julia, apparently the first to do so.	將 Julie Powell 的「The Julie/Julia Project」部落格內容集結出版的書籍後來翻拍成電影《美味關係》(Julie & Julia)，首開業界先例。
Consumer-generated advertising is a relatively new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers.	消費者創作廣告行銷是較為新穎且具有爭議的趨勢發展，建立了公司企業與消費者之間的嶄新行銷傳播模式。
Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts.	在各式各樣的部落格廣告行銷中，最具爭議的莫過於業配文。
These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords.	這些會是以意見回饋、評論、意見表述、影片等形式發表的部落格內容或貼文，而且通常內含使用了一組或多組關鍵詞的業配網站連結。
Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites.	部落格導致了某種程度的去中間化並瓦解了傳統的廣告行銷模式，讓公司能夠略過廣告代理商 (這在之前是接觸顧客的唯一窗口)，直接透過社群媒體網站與顧客聯繫。
On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, to take advantage of this new development as well.	另一方面，專營部落格廣告行銷的新創公司也紛紛設立，搭上新一波趨勢發展的順風車。
However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development.	然而，有許多人並不看好這樣的趨勢發展。
Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.	有些人相信部落格上的各種商業行為將會毀壞部落格圈的可信度。
Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences.	書寫部落格可能會面臨到一連串的法律責任以及其他意料之外的後果。
Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability.	法庭上已經出現好幾起部落客涉嫌誹謗或得面臨法律責任的案件。
U.S. payouts related to blogging totaled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance.	2009 年，美國境內與部落格相關的罰鍰總額為一千七百四十萬美元，其中有一部分是傘護式責任保險的理賠金。
The courts have returned with mixed verdicts.	每個法庭的判決結果都不太一樣。
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC).	一般而言，網際網路服務供應商 (ISP) 對於來自第三方的資訊概不擔負法律責 (參照《美國通訊端正法》(U.S. Communications Decency Act) 和《歐盟電子商務指令》(EU Directive 2000/31/EC)) 。
In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration.	在 Doe v. Cahill 訴訟案的審理過程中，德拉瓦州立最高法院堅持要在符合嚴格標準的情形下查出匿名部落客的真實身分，並且罕見地撤銷誹謗告訴 (此舉無美國誹謗罪相關法律根據) 而非駁回初審法院重新審理。
In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival.	案情接著急轉直下，Cahill 團隊順利得知 John Doe 的真實身分，正是他們之前所懷疑的那個人：當地城鎮的鎮長，為 Cahill 議員的政敵。
The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.	Cahill 團隊隨後修正了原先的告訴，那位鎮長則以和解避免了後續審判。
In January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over an alleged defamation.	2007 年 1 月，兩位知名的馬來西亞政論部落客，Jeff Ooi 和 Ahirudin Attan，因涉嫌誹謗而遭到親政府報紙媒體 (《馬來西亞新海峽時報》(The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia)) 的 Berhad、Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan、Hishamuddin bin Aun 和 Brenden John a/l John Pereira 等人提告。
The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government.	馬來西亞政府在當時支持原告。
Following the suit, the Malaysian government proposed to "register" all bloggers in Malaysia in order to better control parties against their interest.	在訴訟過後，馬來西亞政府提議要國內所有部落客「註冊登記」，以便嚴加管控會影響到政府利益的派系人馬。
This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country.	這是該國首例提告部落客的法律訴訟。
In the United States, blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 2005.	2005 年，部落客 Aaron Wall 在美國遭到 Traffic Power 公司提告誹謗以及公開營業秘密。
According to Wired magazine, Traffic Power had been "banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results." Wall and other "white hat" search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public.	據《連線》(Wired) 雜誌報導，Traffic Power 曾因為「涉嫌操縱搜尋引擎的搜尋結果而遭 Google 下達禁令」。Wall 和其他「白帽」搜尋引擎最佳化諮詢顧問則以保護普羅大眾之名，揭發了 Traffic Power 的惡行惡狀。
The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.	這起訴訟案因為缺少屬人管轄權而遭到撤銷，Traffic Power 也並未在允許的時限內提起上訴。
The word "pineapple" in English was first recorded to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed pine cones).	據文獻記載，英文中的「鳳梨」(pineapple) 一開始是用來形容針葉樹的果實 (如今均改以「松果」(pine cones) 稱之)。
When European explorers encountered this tropical fruit in the Americas, they called them "pineapples" (first referenced in 1664, for resemblance to pine cones).	當年，來自歐洲的探險者在美洲遇見了這種熱帶水果，就稱其為「pineapple」(首見於 1664 年的文獻，因為覺得這水果形似松果)。
In the scientific binomial Ananas comosus, ananas, the original name of the fruit, comes from the Tupi word nanas, meaning "excellent fruit", as recorded by André Thevet in 1555, and comosus, "tufted", refers to the stem of the fruit.	這種水果的原始學名為 Ananas (鳳梨屬) 的 Ananas comosus，源自於巴西圖皮族語的「nanas」，即「絕佳水果」之意。該族語名稱由 André Thevet 於 1555 年記錄在相關文獻中。學名中的「comosus」 (「叢生」之意) 則是用來指稱這種水果的莖部。
Other members of the genus Ananas are often called pine, as well, in other languages.	鳳梨屬的其他成員在其他語言中也通常會以「松」(pine) 為名。
In the wild, pineapples are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds.	野生的鳳梨主要都是透過蜂鳥幫忙授粉。
Certain wild pineapples are foraged and pollinated at night by bats.	有某些品種的野生鳳梨則在夜間供蝙蝠覓食並協助授粉。
Under cultivation, because seed development diminishes fruit quality, pollination is performed by hand, and seeds are retained only for breeding.	在種植過程中，因為種子的發育會損害水果品質，所以一律採取人工授粉，種子僅保留為育種用途。
Specifically in Hawaii, where pineapples were cultivated and canned industrially throughout the 20th century, importation of hummingbirds was prohibited.	夏威夷從二十世紀以來已經種植鳳梨並建立鳳梨罐頭工業達百年之久，這裡明文規定禁止讓蜂鳥入境。
The plant is indigenous to South America and is said to originate from the area between southern Brazil and Paraguay; however, little is known about the origin of the domesticated pineapple (Pickersgill, 1976).	鳳梨是在南美洲土生土長的水果，據說其發源地為介於巴西南部和巴拉圭之間的區域。然而，人工種植鳳梨的起源卻鮮為人知 (Pickersgill, 1976)。
MS Bertoni (1919) considered the Paraná–Paraguay River drainages to be the place of origin of A. comosus.	MS Bertoni (1919) 認為巴拉那—巴拉圭河流域為鳳梨的起源地。
The natives of southern Brazil and Paraguay spread the pineapple throughout South America, and it eventually reached the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico, where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs.	巴西和巴拉圭的原住民將鳳梨傳播到南美洲各地，最終抵達了加勒比海地區、中美洲和墨西哥，讓馬雅人和阿茲特克人種植養育。
Columbus encountered the pineapple in 1493 on the leeward island of Guadeloupe.	哥倫布於 1493 年在瓜地洛普的背風群島遇見了鳳梨。
He called it piña de Indes, meaning "pine of the Indians", and brought it back with him to Spain, thus making the pineapple the first bromeliad to be introduced by humans outside of the New World.	他稱之為「piña de Indes」(即「印地安松果」之意)，並將它帶回去西班牙，鳳梨就此成為在新大陸之外的人們首次認識到的鳳梨科植物。
The Spanish introduced it into the Philippines, Hawaii (introduced in the 18th century, first commercial plantation 1886), Zimbabwe, and Guam.	西班牙人隨後將鳳梨引進菲律賓、夏威夷 (於十八世紀引進，並於 1886 年首度進行商業種植)、辛巴威和關島。
The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and introduced it into India by 1550.	葡萄牙人從巴西取得了這款水果，並於 1550 年引進印度。
The pineapple was brought to northern Europe by the Dutch from their colony in Surinam.	荷蘭人則從他們位於蘇利南的殖民地將鳳梨帶到歐洲北部。
The first pineapple to be successfully cultivated in Europe, is said to have been grown by Pieter de la Court at Meerburg in 1658.	據說在歐洲成功種出來的第一顆鳳梨是由 Pieter de la Court 於 1658 年在密爾堡 (Meerburg) 種植養育完成。
In England, the first pineapple was grown at Dorney Court, Dorney in Buckinghamshire, and a huge "pineapple stove" needed to grow the plants had been built at the Chelsea Physic Garden in 1723.	在英國，鳳梨首次栽種於白金漢郡多尼村的多尼莊園 (Dorney Court)，之後則於 1723 年在切爾西藥草園 (Chelsea Physic Garden) 建造了一座巨大的鳳梨溫室。
In France, King Louis XV was presented with a pineapple that had been grown at Versailles in 1733. Catherine the Great ate pineapples grown on her own estates before her death in 1796.	在法國，有人於 1733 年進貢了在凡爾賽地區種植的鳳梨給法國國王路易十五。俄國女皇凱薩琳二世則在 1796 年逝世之前吃過種植在自家皇宮內的鳳梨。
Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate, using hothouses called "pineries", pineapples soon became a symbol of wealth.	因為直接進口鳳梨的費用高昂，再加上於溫帶氣候種植鳳梨需要耗資鉅額購買設備、聘請勞工與建造名為「鳳梨園」的溫室設施，鳳梨很快就成為了財富象徵。
They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot.	鳳梨一開始主要是用來當作晚宴聚會上的展示品，並非拿來食用，而且會重複使用到鳳梨開始腐爛為止。
By the second half of the 18th century, the production of the fruit on British estates had become the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats.	到了十八世紀下半葉，在英國莊園內種植鳳梨成為了豪紳貴族之間相互較勁的主要項目。
John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore built a hothouse on his estate surmounted by a huge stone cupola 14 metres tall in the shape of the fruit; it is known as the Dunmore Pineapple.	John Murray，世襲第四代鄧莫爾伯爵，曾在自家莊園建造了一座溫室，並在溫室上方蓋了一座高達 14 公尺的巨大石造圓頂，且以鳳梨為型，故有「鄧莫爾鳳梨」之稱。
John Kidwell is credited with the introduction of the pineapple industry to Hawaii; large-scale pineapple cultivation by US companies began in the early 1900s.	John Kidwell 為讓夏威夷開始出現鳳梨產業的主要人物。由美國公司主導的大規模鳳梨栽種則於 1900 年代早期開始進行。
Among the most famous and influential pineapple industrialists was James Dole, who moved to Hawaii in 1899 and started a pineapple plantation in 1900.	James Dole 為當時最有名氣且最具影響力的鳳梨大亨之一，他於 1899 年遷居夏威夷，並於 1900 年開始栽種鳳梨。
The companies Dole and Del Monte began growing pineapples on the island of Oahu in 1901 and 1917, respectively.	Dole 和德爾蒙公司 (Del Monte) 的公司分別於 1901 年和 1917 年開始在歐胡島上種植鳳梨。
Dole's pineapple company began with the acquisition of 60 acres (24 ha) of land in 1901, and grew into a major company, the Dole Food Company.	Dole 的鳳梨公司一開始先在 1901 年取得了 60 英畝 (24 公頃) 的土地，然後逐漸成為一間大公司，也就是後來的都樂食品公司 (Dole Food Company)。
Maui Pineapple Company began pineapple cultivation on the island of Maui in 1909.	茂宜鳳梨公司 (Maui Pineapple Company) 於 1909 年開始在茂宜島上種植鳳梨。
In the US, in 1986, the Pineapple Research Institute was dissolved and its assets divided between Del Monte and Maui Land and Pineapple.	在美國，鳳梨研究所 (Pineapple Research Institute) 於 1986 年正式解編，其資產則分給了德爾蒙公司和茂宜土地和鳳梨公司 (Maui Land and Pineapple)。
Del Monte took cultivar '73–114', dubbed 'MD-2', to its plantations in Costa Rica, found it to be well-suited to growing there, and launched it publicly in 1996 as 'Gold Extra Sweet', while Del Monte also began marketing '73–50', dubbed 'CO-2', as 'Del Monte Gold'.	德爾蒙公司將別稱「MD-2」的「73–114」號鳳梨品種栽種於哥斯大黎加，發現這款品種相當適合當地的生長環境，並於 1996 年以「極甜金鳳梨」為名公開販售。德爾蒙公司同時也開始以「德爾蒙金鳳梨」為名行銷另一款別稱「CO-2」的「73-50」號鳳梨品種。
Dole ceased its cannery operations in Honolulu in 1991, and in 2008, Del Monte terminated its pineapple-growing operations in Hawaii.	都樂公司設立於檀香山的罐頭工廠於 1991 年停止運作，德爾蒙公司則於 2008 年終止在夏威夷的鳳梨栽種事業。
In 2009, the Maui Pineapple Company reduced its operations to supply pineapples only locally on Maui, and by 2013, only the Dole Plantation on Oahu grew pineapples in a volume of about 0.1 percent of the world's production.	2009 年，茂宜鳳梨公司將營運規模縮減為專營茂宜本島的鳳梨供銷業務。到了 2013 年，只剩下都樂公司的鳳梨園還在歐胡島上營運，產量約莫為全球總產量的千分之一。
The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were also traditionally widely cultivated in the Philippines for the textile industry from at least the 17th century.	名為「紅色西班牙」的鳳梨品種最晚從十七世紀開始於菲律賓境內廣泛栽種，供紡織工業使用。
They were originally brought to the islands from Latin America during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines.	這款鳳梨最先是在西班牙殖民期間從拉丁美洲引進菲律賓。
Smooth Cayenne' was later introduced in the early 1900s by the Bureau of Agriculture during the American colonial period.	之後在 1900 年代早期的美國殖民期間，農業部引進了「開英種」鳳梨。
Dole and Del Monte also established plantations in the island of Mindanao in the 1920s; in the provinces of Cotabato and Bukidnon, respectively.	都樂公司和德爾蒙公司也於 1920 年代在民答那峨島上建立了鳳梨園，分別位於哥打巴托省 (Cotabato) 和布基農省 (Bukidnon)。
The Philippines remain one of the top exporters of pineapples in the world.	菲律賓至今仍然是全球數一數二的鳳梨出口國。
The Del Monte plantations are now locally managed, after Del Monte Pacific Ltd., a Filipino company, completed the purchase of Del Monte Foods in 2014.	德爾蒙公司的鳳梨園現由菲律賓本地的德爾蒙太平洋股份有限公司 (Del Monte Pacific Ltd.) 負責管理。該公司於 2014 年完成併購德爾蒙食品公司。
The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were once extensively cultivated in the Philippines.	「紅色西班牙」鳳梨曾經一度遍植於菲律賓境內各地。
The long leaves of the cultivar were the source of traditional piña fibers, an adaptation of the native weaving traditions with fibers extracted from abacá.	該品種的長條鳳梨葉為傳統鳳梨纖維織料的來源，用來取代傳統原住民使用的馬尼拉麻蕉纖維織料。
These were woven into lustrous lace-like nipis fabrics usually decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado.	這些織料會編織成有著蕾絲般光澤的輕薄布料，通常會繡上名為「卡拉朵」(calado) 和「索布拉朵」(sombrados) 的精細花朵圖樣。
The fabric was a luxury export from the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period and gained favor among European aristocracy in the 18th and 19th centuries.	在西班牙殖民期間。這種布料為自菲律賓出口的奢侈品，並於 18 和 19 世紀廣受歐洲貴族喜愛。
Domestically, they were used to make the traditional barong Tagalog, baro't saya, and traje de mestiza clothing of the Filipino upper class, as well as women's kerchiefs (pañuelo).	在菲律賓境內，這些布料會用來為菲律賓的上流階級製作巴隆他加祿 (Barong Tagalog)、巴羅特沙耶 (baro't saya) 和特拉耶德梅蒂莎 (traje de mestiza) 等傳統服飾，以及女性的頭巾 (pañuelo)。
They were favored for their light and breezy quality, which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands.	其輕盈且透氣的質地十分適合島上的熱帶氣候，受到眾人喜愛。]
The industry was destroyed in the Second World War and is only starting to be revived.	該紡織產業在二戰期間遭毀，只能努力恢復往日榮景。
In 2017, world production of pineapples was 27.4 million tons, led by Costa Rica, the Philippines, Brazil, and Thailand as the largest producers.	2017 年，全球的鳳梨總產量達二千七百四十萬噸，主要出口國為哥斯大黎加、菲律賓、巴西和泰國。
In commercial farming, flowering can be induced artificially, and the early harvesting of the main fruit can encourage the development of a second crop of smaller fruits.	在商業農作方面，目前可以透過人工方式誘發鳳梨開花。主要水果作物若可提前採收，就能夠鼓勵栽種較小的水果當作二期作物。
Once removed during cleaning, the top of the pineapple can be planted in soil and a new plant will grow.	鳳梨頭在清洗過程中切除後，即可種到土裡長出新作物。
Three-quarters of the pineapples sold in Europe are grown in Costa Rica, where pineapple production is highly industrialised.	在歐洲銷售的鳳梨有四分之三栽種於哥斯大黎加，當地的鳳梨產業已高度工業化。
Growers typically use 20 kg (44 lb) of pesticides per hectare in each growing cycle, a process that may affect soil quality and biodiversity.	一般而言，在每一期的鳳梨耕作期間，每一公頃的田地會用到 20 公斤 (44 磅) 的農藥，這過程可能會影響到土壤品質和生態多樣性。
The pesticides—organophosphates, organochlorines, and hormone disruptors—have the potential to affect workers' health and can contaminate local drinking water supplies.	這些農藥 (內含有機磷和荷爾蒙干擾素) 有可能會影響耕作人員的身體健康，且會汙染當地的飲用水源。
Many of these chemicals have potential to be carcinogens, and may be related to birth defects.	其中還有許多可能會致癌以及造成先天缺陷的化學物質。
Because of commercial pressures, many pineapple workers in Costa Rica—60% of whom are Nicaraguan—are paid low wages.	因為公司方有經營壓力，許多位於哥斯大黎加的耕作人員 (其中有六成是尼加拉瓜人) 的薪資都只是杯水車薪。
European supermarkets' price-reduction policies have lowered growers' incomes.	歐洲超市的降價政策讓耕作者的收入隨之減少。
One major pineapple producer contests these claims.	其中有個主要的鳳梨生產國質疑這些主帳。
Pineapple fruits and peels contain diverse phytochemicals, among which are polyphenols, including gallic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and arbutin.	鳳梨的果肉和果皮均含有豐富多樣的植化素，其中有些屬於多酚類，包括沒食子酸、丁香酸、香蘭素、阿魏酸、芥子酸、香豆酸、綠原酸、表兒茶素和熊果素。
Present in all parts of the pineapple plant, bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes.	鳳梨全株均含有鳳梨酵素，為蛋白水解酵素的混合物。
Bromelain is under preliminary research for a variety of clinical disorders, but to date has not been adequately defined for its effects in the human body.	現在有各式各樣的臨床症狀以鳳梨酵素為初步研究項目，但是到目前為止仍沒有充分證據確定其對於人體的影響。
Bromelain may be unsafe for some users, such as in pregnancy, allergies, or anticoagulation therapy.	鳳梨酵素可能會對孕婦、過敏症患者或是有在服用抗凝血劑的使用者造成危險。
If having sufficient bromelain content, raw pineapple juice may be useful as a meat marinade and tenderizer.	如果生鳳梨汁裡含有充足的鳳梨酵素，不妨拿來醃肉，可以讓肉質更加軟嫩。 
Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as gelatin-based desserts or gel capsules, their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning.	儘管如此，鳳梨酵素還是會在調理某些食物或製作凝凍類甜點或凝膠膠囊等加工製品時造成干擾，因為其蛋白分解活性會在烹煮和裝罐的過程中導致酵素變質。
The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing.	在一般用量的鳳梨果肉中大概不會有太多鳳梨酵素，不過在經過特別萃取後，仍可取得足以進行家庭料理和加工處理的酵素量。
Pineapples are subject to a variety of diseases, the most serious of which is wilt disease vectored by mealybugs typically found on the surface of pineapples, but possibly in the closed blossom cups.	鳳梨本身容易染上多種疾病，其中最嚴重的是經粉介殼蟲傳染的萎凋病。粉介殼蟲一般常見於鳳梨表皮，但也有可能躲藏在緊閉的花苞中。
Other diseases include citrus pink disease, bacterial heart rot, anthracnose, fungal heart rot, root rot, black rot, butt rot, fruitlet core rot, and yellow spot virus.	其他疾病則包括赤衣病、細菌性心腐病、炭疽病、真菌性心腐病、根腐病、黑腐病、基腐病、小果腐敗病和黃斑病毒等。
Pineapple pink disease (not citrus pink disease) is characterized by the fruit developing a brownish to black discoloration when heated during the canning process.	鳳梨赤衣病 (非柑橘赤衣病) 的特徵為果肉在裝罐過程中會因為高溫加熱而出現由褐轉黑的變色現象。
The causal agents of pink disease are the bacteria Acetobacter aceti, Gluconobacter oxydans, Pantoea citrea.	赤衣病的病原為醋酸菌、氧化葡萄糖酸桿菌、檸檬泛菌
and Tatumella ptyseos.	以及痰塔特姆式菌。
Some pests that commonly affect pineapple plants are scales, thrips, mites, mealybugs, ants, and symphylids.	鳳梨植株常見的害蟲為介殼蟲、薊馬、螨蟲、粉介殼蟲、螞蟻和結足蟲。
Heart-rot is the most serious disease affecting pineapple plants.	心腐病為對鳳梨植株影響最重大的疾病。
The disease is caused by Phytophthora cinnamoni and P. parasitica, fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions.	該疾病是由樟疫黴和疫病菌 (P. parasitica) 所導致，通常會在潮濕天候中影響鳳梨生長。
Since it is difficult to treat, it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available; all suckers that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide, since the fungus enters through the wounds.	因為該疾病難以治療，建議在條件允許下透過栽種具有抵抗力的品種來防止染疫，且因為真菌會透過傷口入侵，所以繁殖所需的吸芽均需浸泡在殺菌劑中。
Some buyers prefer green fruit, others ripened or off-green.	有些買家偏愛未熟的青綠水果，有些則偏愛熟透或半熟的水果。
A plant growth regulator, Ethephon, is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest, developing ethylene, which turns the fruit golden yellow.	益收生長素 (Ethephon) 為植物生長調節劑，一般會在採收前一週拿來噴灑在水果上，產生會讓水果金黃熟透的乙烯。
After cleaning and slicing, a pineapple is typically canned in sugar syrup with added preservative.	鳳梨在清洗和切片過後，一般會和糖漿一同裝罐，並加入防腐劑。
A pineapple never becomes any riper than it was when harvested.	鳳梨在採收之後就不會再繼續熟成。
The fruit itself is quite perishable and if it is stored at room temperature, it should be used within two days; however, if it is refrigerated, the time span extends to 5–7 days.	若儲藏在室溫中，其果肉本身相當容易腐壞，應於兩天內食用完畢。不過，若是放在冰箱冷藏，則儲藏時間可以延長至 5 到 7 天。
Mimi Sheller writes: "The pineapple entered European iconography as a symbol of welcome and hospitality, and also eventually found its way into botanical gardens such as the Chelsea Physic Garden, where it was grown in heated pits." The sweet fruit had a "mysterious aura" in the Age of Sail because except for a "small elite with access to glass hothouses", tropical fruits could only be tasted where they were cultivated.	Mimi Sheller 寫道：「鳳梨剛開始在歐洲的圖像學裡為熱情歡迎和殷勤好客的象徵，後來則踏進如切爾西藥草園那般的庭園之中，在溫室中成長茁壯。」這款滋味甜美的水果大航海時代曾有著「神秘香氣」，因為除了「少數得以進入玻璃溫室的貴族菁英」之外，就只能在原先種植的地方才能品嚐到這類熱帶水果。
Christopher Cumo writes that "The Spanish who followed Columbus delighted in eating pineapple and in writing about it for a European public eager to learn of the flora and fauna of the Americas ...	Christopher Cumo 寫道：「跟隨著哥倫布的西班牙人十分喜歡吃鳳梨，也一邊寫著關於鳳梨的文章，滿足歐洲的普羅大眾對於美洲當地動植物的求知欲望…
The pineapple was first a luxury because transit from the tropics to Europe was expensive in the age of sail.	因為在大航海時代，從熱帶地區運送貨物到歐洲的費用高昂，所以鳳梨一開始是種奢侈品。
In this respect, pineapple was much like sugar, a commodity of privilege before it became an item of the masses." Cumo writes that "pineapple was the fruit of colonialism" because the Portuguese, French, Dutch, and British all sought to establish pineapple plantations in the tropics of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.	從這方面來看，鳳梨就像是糖一般，在成為大眾日常用品之前曾是特權階級才能享有的商品。」Cumo 接著寫道：「鳳梨是殖民主義之果」，因為葡萄牙、法國、荷蘭和英國等殖民政權都相繼設法在位處熱帶的南美洲、中美洲及加勒比海地區建造鳳梨園。
In architecture, pineapple figures are a decorative element symbolizing hospitality.	在建築學中，鳳梨圖像為象徵熱情好客的裝飾元素。
Usually in plaster or carved wood, pineapples images occur in finials, pendants,"broken" pediments, and door knockers.	鳳梨圖像通常會以石膏或木雕等形式當做尖頂裝飾、吊飾、鑲嵌楣飾和門環裝飾。
Pineapples have long been associated with the Hawaiian Islands, to the extent that the pineapple is sometimes used as a symbol of Hawaii, despite the decline of the pineapple industry in that state.	鳳梨長年來都會和夏威夷群島聯想在一起，儘管當地的鳳梨產業每況愈下，鳳梨有時候還是會被用來當成夏威夷的象徵。
Foods with pineapple in them are sometimes known as "Hawaiian" for this reason alone.	就是因為如此，加入鳳梨的料理有時候也會被稱為「夏威夷」料理。
A roller coaster is a type of amusement ride that employs a form of elevated railroad track designed with tight turns, steep slopes, and sometimes inversions.	雲霄飛車是一種使用高架軌道的遊樂設施，其軌道會有急彎和陡坡等設計，有時候還會出現倒置翻轉。
People ride along the track in open cars, and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world.	遊客乘坐在軌道上的開放式車廂中，世界各地的遊樂園和主題樂園通常都會有這項遊樂設施。
LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained one of the first known patents for a roller coaster design in 1885, related to the Switchback Railway that opened a year earlier at Coney Island.	LaMarcus Adna Thompson 於 1885 年獲得其中一項目前已知的首批雲霄飛車設計專利，與前一年在康尼島上開放遊玩的「折返鐵道」(Switchback Railway) 雲霄飛車有關。
The track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate.	雲霄飛車的軌道設計並非一定是個完整的迴圈，好比飛梭式雲霄飛車所展示的軌道樣貌。
Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained.	大多數的雲霄飛車都有多節車廂，遊客可坐在裡面並受到安全裝置保護。
Two or more cars hooked together are called a train.	兩節以上接連扣在一起的車廂會稱為「列車」。
Some roller coasters, notably Wild Mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.	有些雲霄飛車是以單節車廂運轉，如著名的「野鼠」(Wild Mouse) 雲霄飛車。
The oldest roller coasters are believed to have originated from the so-called "Russian Mountains", specially constructed hills of ice located in the area that is now Saint Petersburg, Russia.	雲霄飛車的始祖據信是起源自名為「俄羅斯山」的滑雪設施，特別建造在今日俄國聖彼得堡地區的冰雪山丘上。
Built in the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between 21 and 24 m (70 and 80 feet), had a 50-degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.	該設施建造於十七世紀，高度介於 21 公尺 (約 70 英尺) 至 24 公尺 (約 80英尺) 之間，滑坡的坡度達 50 度，以木造結構穩固支撐。 
Later, in 1784, Catherine the Great is said to have constructed a sledding hill in the gardens of her palace at Oranienbaum in St. Petersburg.	據說後來在 1784 年，凱薩琳大帝在位於聖彼得堡的奧拉寧鮑姆宮中庭園建造了一座滑雪丘。
The name Russian Mountains to designate a roller coaster is preserved in many languages (e.g. the Spanish montaña rusa), but the Russian term for roller coasters is американские горки ("amerikanskiye gorki"), which translates to "American mountains."	在許多語言當中，「俄羅斯山」這個名稱都是用來指稱雲霄飛車 (例如西班牙文的「montaña rusa」)，但是俄文中的雲霄飛車卻是「американские горки (『amerikanskiye gorki』)」，直譯為「美國山」之意。
The first modern roller coaster, the Promenades Aeriennes, opened in Parc Beaujon in Paris on July 8, 1817.	首座現代雲霄飛車為「空中漫遊」(Promenades Aeriennes)，於 1817 年 7 月 8 日在巴黎的博容樂園 (Parc Beaujon) 正式營運。
It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds.	該雲霄飛車的特色為輪子牢牢鎖在軌道上的車廂、設有防止車廂偏離的導軌，以及更快的速度。
It spawned half a dozen imitators, but their popularity soon declined.	後來接連出現了六座仿造的雲霄飛車，但是人氣很快就一落千丈。
However, during the Belle Epoque they returned to fashion.	然而到了「美好年代」 (Belle Epoque) 時期，這些雲霄飛車再度讓大眾趨之若鶩。
In 1887 French entrepreneur Joseph Oller, co-founder of the Moulin Rouge music hall, constructed the Montagnes Russes de Belleville, "Russian Mountains of Belleville" with 656 feet (200 m) of track laid out in a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.	1887 年，法國企業家 Joseph Oller (即紅磨坊 (Moulin Rouge) 音樂廳的共同創辦人) 打造出「美麗城俄羅斯山」(Montagnes Russes de Belleville) 雲霄飛車。其長達 656 英尺 (200 公尺) 的軌道鋪設成雙重 8 字型迴圈，後來再擴建為四重 8 字型迴圈。
In 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway, a downhill gravity railroad used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania – now known as Jim Thorpe.	1827 年。有一間位於賓州薩米特山的礦業公司建造了莫赫瓊克折返鐵道 (Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway)，為利用重力將煤礦運到山下的賓州莫赫瓊克地區 (今吉姆索普區) 的鐵道。
By the 1850s, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers.	到了 1850 年代，這條「重力鐵道」(後來的慣稱) 開始賣票給想要追求刺激的遊客。
Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.	鐵道公司會在載客量少的那幾天使用類似的軌道設施來提供娛樂。
Using this idea as a basis, LaMarcus Adna Thompson began work on a gravity Switchback Railway that opened at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, in 1884. Passengers climbed to the top of a platform and rode a bench-like car down the 600-foot (183 m) track up to the top of another tower where the vehicle was switched to a return track and the passengers took the return trip.	LaMarcus Adna Thompson 以此想法為基礎開始設計由重力導引的「折返鐵道」雲霄飛車，並於 1884 年在紐約布魯克林區的康尼島正式營運。遊客要先爬到頂端平台，然後坐上像長椅一般的的車廂，直接向下俯衝長達 600 英尺 (183 公尺) 的軌道，來到另一座高塔的頂端。車廂會在這裡切換到返程軌道上，讓遊客沿著原路歸返。
This track design was soon replaced with an oval complete circuit.	這項軌道設計很快就讓完整的橢圓形迴圈所取代。
In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first full-circuit coaster with a lift hill, the Gravity Pleasure Road, which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.	1885 年，Phillip Hinkle 打造出第一座設有爬升坡及完整迴圈的雲霄飛車 (即「重力樂遨遊」(Gravity Pleasure Road)，隨後成為康尼島上最受歡迎的樂園景點。
Not to be outdone, in 1886 Thompson patented his design of roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery.	Thompson 不甘示弱，於 1886 年為自己包含了漆黑隧道和景觀圖畫的雲霄飛車設計申請了專利。
"Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county.	沒過多久，「景觀鐵道」如雨後春筍般出現在全國各地的遊樂園中。
By 1919, the first underfriction roller coaster had been developed by John Miller.	到了 1919 年，John Miller 研發出第一座低摩擦雲霄飛車。
Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world.	不久，雲霄飛車便出現在全球各地的遊樂園中。
Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, Cyclone, was opened at Coney Island in 1927.	於 1927 年在康尼島上正式營運的「旋風」(Cyclone) 雲霄飛車，可說是史上最知名的雲霄飛車。
The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, and theme parks, in general, went into decline.	經濟大蕭條讓雲霄飛車的黃金年代告終，主題樂園也普遍開始走下坡。
This lasted until 1972 when the instant success of The Racer at Kings Island began a roller coaster renaissance which has continued to this day.	直到 1972 年，「國王島賽車手」(The Racer at Kings Island) 一夕爆紅，這才讓雲霄飛車重返榮耀並延續至今。
In 1959, Disneyland introduced a design breakthrough with Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first roller coaster to use a tubular steel track.	1959 年，迪士尼樂園使用突破以往的設計概念上打造出「馬特洪雪橇歷險」 (Matterhorn Bobsleds)，這是第一座使用鋼管軌道的雲霄飛車。
Unlike wooden coaster rails, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, allowing designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs.	不同於木造軌道，鋼軌可以往各種方向彎折，讓設計師得以在設計圖稿中納入迴圈、螺旋和其他許多巧妙變化。
Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden coasters and hybrids are still being built.	現代大部分的雲霄飛車都是以鋼鐵建成。儘管如此，現在還是有人在建造木製和鐵木混合的雲霄飛車。
There are several explanations of the name roller coaster.	「雲霄飛車」(roller coaster) 的命名緣由有好幾種說法。
It is said to have originated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast.	據說這名稱源自於早期的美式設計。當時會在滑坡軌道上裝設滾輪，讓橇板可以直接溜下去。
This design was abandoned in favor of fitting the wheels to the sled or other vehicles, but the name endured.	這項設計後來改成將輪子安裝到橇板或其他設施載具上，但名稱維持不變。
Another explanation is that it originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887.	另一種說法是該名稱起源自 1887 年某座位於麻州黑弗里爾一處溜冰場內的遊樂設施。
A toboggan-like sled was raised to the top of a track which consisted of hundreds of rollers.	載具看起像是平底雪橇，抬升到裝設了上百顆滾輪的軌道上方。
This Roller Toboggan then took off down gently rolling hills to the floor.	平底雪橇飛車接著會緩緩從山丘上滑落到地面。
The inventors of this ride, Stephen E. Jackman and Byron B. Floyd, claim that they were the first to use the term "roller coaster".	這項設施的發明者為 Stephen E. Jackman 和 Byron B. Floyd，據稱他們就是首先使用「roller coaster」做為名稱的人。
The term jet coaster is used for roller coasters in Japan, where such amusement park rides are very popular.	日本則稱雲霄飛車為「噴射飛車」，在當地的遊樂園中十分受歡迎。
In many languages, the name refers to "Russian mountains".	在許多語言中會以「俄羅斯山」來稱呼雲霄飛車。
Contrastingly, in Russian, they are called "American mountains".	俄文卻反倒稱呼雲霄飛車為「美國山」。
In the Scandinavian languages and German, the roller coaster is referred as "mountain-and-valley railway".	在斯堪地那維亞語系和德文中，雲霄飛車被稱作是「山嶺峻谷鐵道」。
German also knows the word "Achterbahn", stemming from "Figur-8-Bahn", like Dutch "Achtbaan", relating to the form of the number 8 ("acht" in German and also Dutch).	德文也會以「Achterbahn」指稱雲霄飛車，其字首根源自德文的「8 字形鐵道」(如同荷蘭文的「Achtbaan」)，和飛車軌道的 8 字形狀有所關聯 (「acht」在德文和荷蘭文中都有「8」的意思)。
Several height classifications have been used by parks and manufacturers in marketing their roller coasters, as well as enthusiasts within the industry.	遊樂園園方和製造商在行銷雲霄飛車時有使用好幾個高度類別，業界的雲霄飛車愛好者也會跟著使用。
One classification, the kiddie coaster, is a roller coaster specifically designed for younger riders.	其中一個類別為兒童雲霄飛車，專門設計給較為年幼的乘客遊玩。
Following World War II, parks began pushing for more of them to be built in contrast to the height and age restrictions of standard designs at the time.	在二戰過後，遊樂園紛紛開始建造更多與當時年齡及身高標準限制大相逕庭的兒童雲霄飛車。
Companies like Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) developed scaled-down versions of their larger models to accommodate the demand.	如費城雪橇飛車公司 (Philadelphia Toboggan Company，簡稱 PTC) 等業者相繼發展出等比縮小版的雲霄飛車來順應市場需求。
These typically featured lift hills smaller than 25 feet (7.6 m), and still do today.	一般而言，這類雲霄飛車的爬坡高度會低於 25 英尺 (7.6 公尺)，至今依然如此。
The rise of kiddie coasters soon led to the development of "junior" models that had lift hills up to 45 feet (14 m).	兒童雲霄飛車興起之後沒多久，將爬坡高度提高到 45 英尺 (14 公尺) 的「青少年」版於焉誕生。
A notable example of a junior coaster is the Sea Dragon – the oldest operating roller coaster from PTC's legendary designer John Allen – which opened at Wyandot Lake in 1956 near Powell, Ohio.	「海龍號」(Sea Dragon) 為青少年雲霄飛車的著名典範。這是由 PTC 的傳奇設計師 John Allen 所設計且至今營運歷史最久遠的雲霄飛車，於 1956 年在鄰近俄亥俄州鮑威爾市的懷恩多特湖畔正式亮相。
A hypercoaster, occasionally stylized as hyper coaster, is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least 200 feet (61 m).	超級雲霄飛車 (hypercoaster，有時會分開寫成 hyper coaster) 為高度落差在 200 英尺 (61 公尺) 以上的雲霄飛車。
Moonsault Scramble, which debuted at Fuji-Q Highland in 1984, was the first to break this barrier, though the term hypercoaster was first coined by Cedar Point and Arrow Dynamics with the opening of Magnum XL-200 in 1989.	1984 年在日本富士急樂園 (Fuji-Q Highland) 初次亮相的「銀月瀑布爭霸戰」(Moonsault Scramble) 為首座突破這項高度障礙的雲霄飛車。不過，「超級雲霄飛車」這個詞彙卻是遲至 1989 年才由杉點主題樂園 (Cedar Point) 和箭矢動力公司 (Arrow Dynamics) 在「麥格努姆 XL-200 」雲霄飛車開張時創造出來。
Hypercoasters have become one of the most predominant types of roller coasters in the world, now led by manufacturers Bolliger & Mabillard and Intamin.	超級雲霄飛車現已成為全球首屈一指的主流雲霄飛車類型，Bolliger & Mabillard 和 Intamin 為兩大龍頭製造商。
Salmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes.	鮭魚一般會在高緯度地區的淡水河流中產卵。
The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry.	魚卵會孵化出魚苗或囊魚苗。
The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes.	魚苗很快就會長成幼鮭，身上出現五彩斑斕的垂直條紋。
The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off.	幼鮭要在自己出生的河流中待上六個月到三年才會變成銀色小鮭魚，身上會出現明亮的銀白色以及容易刮除的魚鱗。
Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.	據估計只有一成的鮭魚卵能夠存活到這個階段。
The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water.	銀色小鮭魚體內的化學物質產生變化，讓牠們能夠在鹽水裡生活。
While a few species of salmon remain in fresh water throughout their life cycle, the majority are anadromous and migrate to the ocean for maturation: in these species, smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.	雖然有少數幾種鮭魚一輩子都離不開淡水環境，但多數鮭魚都會迴游並會遷徙到海中成長為成魚。這些種類的銀色小鮭魚會在遷徙入海的過程中到半鹹水裡待上一段時間，好讓體內的化學物質逐漸適應海水的滲透壓。
The salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature.	鮭魚會在大海中待上一到五年 (視品種而有所不同)，在此漸漸達到性成熟。
The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn.	成年的鮭魚隨後會洄游而上，主要是為了回到出生地產卵。
Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea.	大西洋鮭會在海中待上一到四年。
When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. Grilse may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.	加拿大、英國和愛爾蘭會稱呼在海中僅待滿一年就洄游而上的鮭魚為「年輕鮭魚」(grilse)。年輕鮭魚會出現在產卵地點，然後趁大型雄魚不注意的時候，將自己的精子撒在卵上。
Prior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon undergo changes.	鮭魚會視品種不同在產卵之前有所轉變。
They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon).	牠們可能會背部隆起、長出尖牙或是下顎變得更發達 (雄鮭魚的下顎會更加突出)。
All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour.	所有鮭魚都會從銀藍色的淡水魚轉變成深色的海魚。
Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce.	鮭魚的旅程可說是令人敬佩萬分，有時候會逆流而上數百英里，為了繁衍後代不惜力抗強勁水流和急流。
Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over 1,400 km (900 mi) and climb nearly 2,100 m (7,000 ft) from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn.	例如來自愛達荷州中部的帝王鮭和紅鮭，牠們會從太平洋逆流而行超過 1,400 公里 (約 900 英里) 並攀躍至將近 2,100 公尺 (約 7,000 英尺) 的山上產卵。
Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts.	鮭魚在淡水裡待越久，身體狀況就會越來越差，到了產卵之後更是每況愈下。這時候的鮭魚會被稱為「產後鮭」(kelt)。
In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity.	所有品種的太平洋鮭魚都會在成熟並產卵後的數天或數週內死亡，這樣的特徵稱為「單次繁殖」(semelparity)。
Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females.	在所有雌性鮭魚當中，只有 2% 到 4% 的大西洋產後鮭魚能夠活到再次產卵。
However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%).	然而，即使這些品種的鮭魚能夠活著產卵一次以上 (多次繁殖)，產卵後的死亡率也相當高 (約莫四成到五成)。
To lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd.	雌鮭魚會為了產卵用自己的尾巴 (尾鰭) 拍打出一個低壓區，揚起碎石讓河流沖走，清理出一個名為「產卵區」(redd) 的淺坑。
The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering 2.8 m² (30 sq ft).	產卵區有時可容納 5,000 顆魚卵，面積達 2.8 平方公尺 (約 30 平方英尺)。
The eggs usually range from orange to red.	魚卵的顏色通常介於橘色到紅色之間。
One or more males approach the female in her redd, depositing sperm, or milt, over the roe.	會有一隻以上的雄鮭魚游到待在自己的產卵區內的雌鮭魚身邊，將精子或精液撒在魚卵上。
The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd.	雌鮭魚接著會將淺坑上游側的碎石撥過來蓋住魚卵，然後再去挖出另一個產卵區。
The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.	雌鮭魚在耗盡自己產出的魚卵之前，最多可完成七個產卵區。
Each year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter.	每一年，鮭魚通常會在夏季迎來快速成長期，然後成長速度一般會在冬季趨緩。
This results in ring formation around an earbone called the otolith (annuli), analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk.	這會造成魚類耳石 (otolith) 的環狀紋路 (年輪)，類似在樹幹中會見到隨著年齡增長而出現的環狀紋路。
Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.	在淡水環境中的生長年輪紋路十分密集，在海洋環境中的生長年輪紋路則間隙較寬。產卵期會出現明顯的紋路痕跡，因為其身體質量會在這時期轉化為魚卵和精液。
Freshwater streams and estuaries provide important habitat for many salmon species.	淡水河流和河口區域為許多鮭魚品種提供了重要的棲地環境。
They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older.	這些鮭魚會在幼年時以陸地和水中的昆蟲、端足蟲和其他甲殼類動物為食，成年後則主要以其他魚類為獵食對象。
Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel, and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) to the developing embryos.	魚卵會產在碎石顆粒較大的深水區，並且需要沁涼且流動狀況良好 (利於供氧) 的水域環境來協助胚胎生長。
Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow.	處於幼年階段的鮭魚，由於會遇到自然界中的掠食者以及土石淤積、水溫過高、氧氣濃度不足、缺少溪流蔽蔭以及河川流量減少等人為造成的棲地環境變遷，死亡率通常居高不下。
Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean.	在鮭魚離開棲地前往廣闊海洋之前，河口地區及鄰近相連的濕地可提供至關重要的養育環境。
Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.	濕地不僅能協助緩解河口地區的淤積及汙染危害，也能提供重要的覓食及蔽蔭區域。
Salmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration (phenoptosis, or "programmed aging") at the end of their lives.	倖免於難而存活下來的鮭魚，在生命走到盡頭時會出現急遽劣化 (衰亡，或稱作「程式性老化」)。
Their bodies rapidly deteriorate right after they spawn as a result of the release of massive amounts of corticosteroids.	牠們的身體會因為在產卵期間釋出了大量的皮質類固醇而快速劣化。
In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species, supporting wildlife such as birds, bears and otters.	鮭魚為太平洋西北部海域和阿拉斯加地區的關鍵物種，讓當地的鳥類、熊類和其他野生物種得以存續。
The bodies of salmon represent a transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, to the forest ecosystem.	鮭魚的身體富含氮、硫、碳和磷等元素，為將海洋中的營養素轉移至森林生態系統中的代表物種。
Grizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent wooded areas.	灰熊會捕食鮭魚並將鮭魚帶到鄰近的林地區域，其作用相當於生態系統工程師。
There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses.	牠們會在林地排泄富含營養素的尿液和糞便，以及沒吃完的鮭魚殘骸。
Bears are estimated to leave up to half the salmon they harvest on the forest floor, in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms per hectare, providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands.	據估算，熊在林地間遺棄的鮭魚殘骸數量可達原先捕獲量的一半，密度達到每公頃 4,000 公斤，最多可提供岸邊林地 24% 的有效氮含量。
The foliage of spruce trees up to 500 m (1,600 ft) from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.	在灰熊捕食鮭魚的溪流附近，有人發現高達 500 公尺 (1.600 英尺) 的雲杉樹樹葉中含有源自於鮭魚殘骸的氮元素。
It has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys, loss of the lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way.	有些河川出現了洄游性七鰓鰻數量減少或消失無蹤等狀況，這也會對鮭魚造成負面影響。
Like salmon, anadromous lampreys stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream.	洄游性七鰓鰻和鮭魚一樣會在產卵後不再覓食並邁向死亡，並在遺骸分解後將營養素釋放到溪流中。
Also, along with species like rainbow trout and Sacramento sucker, lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning.	此外，七鰓鰻和虹鱒及沙加緬度亞口魚一樣會在產卵時清除河中碎石。
Their larvae, called ammocoetes, are filter feeders which contribute to the health of the waters.	其幼體名為沙隱蟲，為濾食性動物，可協助維護水域的健康狀態。
They are also a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed predators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on smolts.	沙隱蟲也是幼年鮭魚的食物來源之一，而且因為沙隱蟲比鮭魚幼苗更為肥美，理應會更受掠食者喜愛，進而分擔了幼鮭遭到掠食的生存壓力。
Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and sea lions, which can eat 30 lampreys to every salmon, allowing more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine mammals.	成年的七鰓鰻也是較受海豹和海獅喜愛的獵物，後者每多捕食 30 條七鰓鰻就會少捕食 1 尾鮭魚，進而讓更多成年鮭魚得以游回河中產卵，免遭海洋哺乳類大快朵頤。
According to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxozoan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids.	據加拿大生物學家 Dorothy Kieser 指出，鮭生黏孢子蟲 (Henneguya salminicola) 為鮭魚魚肉中常見的黏體寄生蟲。
It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Haida Gwaii Islands.	這類寄生蟲可見於返回海達瓜依群島 (Haida Gwaii Islands) 的鮭魚田調樣本紀錄中。
The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid.	鮭魚體內會設法將受到寄生蟲感染的部位圍堵起來，進而形成數個內含乳白色液體的囊腫。
This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.	該乳白色液體中積聚了大量寄生蟲。
Henneguya and other parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon is one of two hosts.	黏孢子蟲和其他同屬黏體動物的寄生蟲都有著複雜的生命週期，而鮭魚是其雙宿主之一。
The fish releases the spores after spawning.	感染後的魚會在產卵後釋放孢子。
In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream.	舉黏孢子蟲為例，其孢子會在這時進入到第二位宿主體內，大部分會是產卵溪流中的無脊椎動物。
When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon.	當年幼鮭魚遷居至太平洋時，第二位宿主就會隨之進入鮭魚傳染階段。
The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle.	接著寄生蟲就會待在鮭魚體內，直到下一次產卵週期到來為止，
The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle.	會導致鱒魚染上迴旋病 (whirling disease) 的黏體寄生蟲有著類似的生命週期。
However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon—even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.	然而，黏孢子蟲卻反其道而行，它並不會導致其鮭魚宿主染疫，鮭魚即使重度感染還是能夠順利洄游產卵。
According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states, "the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections.	據 Kieser 博士指出，早在 1980 年代中期，位於納奈莫 (Nanaimo) 的太平洋生物研究站 (Pacific Biological Station) 中就有科學家針對黏孢子蟲進行了許多研究，尤其是在一份綜覽報告中指出：「幼年時期在淡水棲地的居住時間最長的鮭魚，其感染狀況最為明顯。」
Hence in order of prevalence, coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink.	因此，若依感染盛行率排序，則銀鮭最容易遭到感染，再來是紅鉤吻鮭、帝王鮭、鉤吻鮭和粉紅鮭。
As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., "are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection." The report also states, "It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health.	報告中提到，在進行研究當下，位於英屬哥倫比亞境內大河流域 (如弗雷澤河、斯基納河、納斯河等) 的上、中游區以及來自南部沿海溪流的魚群「均可能有較低的感染盛行率」。報告中也提到：「儘管黏孢子蟲在經濟方面會造成危害，但我們也應強調其並不會危害到公共衛生。
It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man".	這是只有魚類會感染到的寄生蟲，無法在如人類般的溫血動物體內存活或造成影響」。
According to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, "Henneguya salminicola is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon.	據與加拿大食品檢驗局合作的軟殼貝類監管計劃專家 Klaus Schallie 出：「黏孢子蟲也有在英屬哥倫比亞南部出現，而且所有品種的鮭魚無一倖免。
I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation."	我之前檢驗了上面滿是囊腫的煙燻秋鮭切片，以及在巴克利灣 (位於英屬哥倫比亞南部及溫哥華島西岸) 出沒且以高感染率聞名的紅鉤吻鮭。」
Sea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon.	海蝨，尤其是鮭魚蝨和各種魚蝨 (包含 C. clemensi 和 C. rogercresseyi 等品種) 會對人工養殖和野生鮭魚造成致命的感染危害。
Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days.	海蝨為體外寄生蟲，以黏液、血液和皮膚為食。它會在游離、浮游體和橈足體等階段遷徙並牢牢附生在野生鮭魚的表皮上，時間可長達好幾天。
Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms	大量且高度群聚的開放式鮭魚養殖場
can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result.	可能會聚集數量異常龐大的海蝨。有許多年幼的野生鮭魚在接觸到闢建了大量開放式養殖場的河口地區後，會接連受到感染並因此喪命。
Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable.	成年鮭魚可在數量達到臨界值的海蝨群中存活下來，但個頭嬌小、表皮細薄且剛剛遷徙到海洋中的幼年鮭魚則十分脆弱。
On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.	在加拿大的太平洋沿岸，有些地區的粉紅鮭的蝨害死亡率往往都會超過八成。
The risk of injury caused by underwater pile driving has been studied by Dr. Halvorsen and her co-workers.	Halvorsen 博士和她的同事共同研究了水下打樁作業導致魚群受傷的風險。
The study concluded that the fish are at risk of injury if the cumulative sound exposure level exceeds 210 dB relative to 1 μPa² s.	研究結果顯示，如果累計噪音暴露位準超過 210 分貝 (re. 1 μPa² s)，就會產生魚群受傷的風險。
As can be seen from the production chart at the left, the global capture reported by different countries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon has remained fairly steady since 1990 at about one million tonnes per year.	如左方生產圖表所示，自 1990 年以來，世界各國向聯合國糧食及農業組織 (FAO) 回報的商用野生鮭魚捕獲量均維持在每年約一百萬噸，相當穩定，
This is in contrast to farmed salmon (below) which has increased in the same period from about 0.6 million tonnes to well over two million tonnes.	人工養殖的鮭魚則大相逕庭 (請見下方圖表)，在同樣一段時間內從約六十萬噸成長至超過二百萬噸。
Nearly all captured wild salmon are Pacific salmon.	幾乎所有被捕獲的野生鮭魚都是太平洋鮭魚。
The capture of wild Atlantic salmon has always been relatively small, and has declined steadily since 1990.	大西洋野生鮭魚的捕獲量一直以來都不多，而且從 1990 年以來每況愈下。
In 2011 only 2,500 tonnes were reported.	在 2011 年僅回報了 2,500 噸。
In contrast about half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.	相比之下，有半數的人工養殖鮭魚為大西洋鮭魚。
Recreational salmon fishing can be a technically demanding kind of sport fishing, not necessarily congenial for beginning fishermen.	釣鮭魚為相當需要技巧的休閒釣魚活動，對於初學者而言不太好上手。
A conflict exists between commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for the right to salmon stock resources.	漁民和釣客之間在捕撈鮭魚魚群資源的權利方面有所衝突。
Commercial fishing in estuaries and coastal areas is often restricted so enough salmon can return to their natal rivers where they can spawn and be available for sport fishing.	在河口及岸邊區域的漁業活動通常會有所限制，好讓足量的鮭魚能夠返回原生河流產卵並提供休閒漁業所需。
On parts of the North American west coast sport salmon fishing completely replaces inshore commercial fishing.	在北美西岸，有部分地區的釣鮭魚休閒產業完全取代了近海漁業。
In most cases, the commercial value of a salmon can be several times less than the value attributed to the same fish caught by a sport fisherman.	在大多數情況下，同一尾鮭魚的商業價值會比讓休閒釣客捕撈所能貢獻的價值還要低上好幾倍。
This is "a powerful economic argument for allocating stock resources preferentially to sport fishing."	這項「經濟論證鏗鏘有力，支持將魚群資源優先分配給休閒漁業」。
Salmon aquaculture is a major contributor to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10 billion annually.	鮭魚養殖為全球養殖漁業的主力大戶，每年產值約一百億美元。
Other commonly cultured fish species include tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream.	其他養殖漁業常見的魚種包括吳郭魚、鯰魚、鱸魚、鯉魚和魴魚等。
Salmon farming is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe.	智利、挪威、蘇格蘭、加拿大和法羅群島等地的鮭魚養殖業十分盛行，為美國和歐洲大部分市售鮭魚的貨源。
Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and Tasmania, Australia.	在俄國和l澳洲的塔斯馬尼亞州等地也有人在養殖大西洋鮭魚 (但數量很少)。
Salmon are carnivorous.	鮭魚為肉食性動物。
They are fed a meal produced from catching other wild fish and other marine organisms.	牠們會以捕捉到的其他野生魚類和海洋生物為食。
Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish.	鮭魚養殖需要大量的野生餌料魚。
Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product.	鮭魚需要攝取大量的蛋白質來補充營養，而養殖漁場中的鮭魚會消耗掉比最終成魚肉量還要多的餌料魚。
On a dry weight basis, 2–4 kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produce one kg of salmon.	以淨重計算，要產出一公斤的鮭魚肉，會需要捕撈二至四公斤的野生魚類。
As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.	隨著鮭魚養殖產業規模擴展，野生餌料魚的需求量也越來越大，全球各地受到監控的漁場一度有七成五已經接近或超過其最大永續產量。
The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.	鮭魚養殖產業大規模捕撈野生餌料魚，影響到仰賴餌料魚為食的野生掠食魚種的生存能力。
Work continues on substituting vegetable proteins for animal proteins in the salmon diet.	目前還在繼續嘗試以植物蛋白質替代鮭魚飲食中的動物蛋白質。
This substitution results in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 fatty acid content in the farmed product.	結果替代飲食導致養殖魚肉中珍貴的 Omega-3 脂肪酸含量減少。
Intensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs.	密集養殖的鮭魚漁場會使用開放式箱網，其生產成本低廉。
Persea americana is a tree that grows to 20 m (66 ft), with alternately arranged leaves 12–25 cm (4.7–9.8 in) long.	酪梨樹可成長至 20 公尺 (66 英尺) 高，具有互生葉序的樹葉可長達 12-25 公分 (4.7-9.8 英吋)。
Panicles of flowers with deciduous bracts arise from new growth or the axils of leaves.	具圓錐花序且苞片易落的新生花苞會從葉腋間冒出來。
The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) wide.	花苞本身並不顯眼，花色黃中帶綠，寬度 5-10 公釐 (約 0.2-0.4 英吋)。
The species is variable because of selection pressure by humans to produce larger, fleshier fruits with a thinner exocarp.	人們為了產出更大、果肉更厚實且果皮更薄透的果實，在選擇壓力下造就了各式各樣的品種。
The avocado fruit is a climacteric, single-seeded berry, due to the imperceptible endocarp covering the seed, rather than a drupe.	酪梨果為更年型的單子漿果，其種子外表有一層難以察覺的內果皮，而非核果。
The pear-shaped fruit is 7–20 cm (2.8–7.9 in) long, weighs between 100 and 1,000 g (3.5 and 35.3 oz), and has a large central seed, 5–6.4 cm (2.0–2.5 in) long.	這種梨形水果的長度為 7-20 公分 (約 2.8-7.9 英吋)，重量介於 100 克至 1,000 克之間 (約 3.5 盎司至 35.3 盎司之間)，中間還有顆長達 5-6.4 公分的碩大種子。
Persea americana, or the avocado, possibly originated in the Tehuacan Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico, although fossil evidence suggests similar species were much more widespread millions of years ago.	酪梨很有可能起源自墨西哥普埃布拉州的提瓦坎谷中，儘管化石佐證了類似的品種早已在數百萬年前遍及更加廣闊的地帶。
However, there is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the avocado, resulting in the currently recognized Mexican (aoacatl), Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), and West Indian (tlacacolaocatl) landraces.	然而，有證據指出三處可能的酪梨馴化培育地點，造就出目前可分辨出來的墨西哥種 (aoactl)、瓜地馬拉種 (quilaoacatl) 及西印度種 (tlacacolaocatl) 等地方品種。
The Mexican and Guatemalan landraces originated in the highlands of those countries, while the West Indian landrace is a lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range through human agency before the arrival of the Europeans.	墨西哥種和瓜地馬拉種起源自這兩個國家的高地區域，西印度種則遍及瓜地馬拉、哥斯大黎加、哥倫比亞、厄瓜多及祕魯等地的低地區域，在歐洲人抵達之前透過人為傳播達成大範圍的種植成果。
The three separate landraces were most likely to have already intermingled in pre-Columbian America and were described in the Florentine Codex.	這三種不同的地方品種很有可能在哥倫布造訪美洲之前就混雜在一起，並記載於「佛羅倫斯手抄本」(Florentine Codex) 中。
The earliest residents were living in temporary camps in an ancient wetland eating avocados, chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds, and sea lions.	最早期的居民住在古老濕地上的臨時聚落，以酪梨、辣椒、軟體動物、鯊魚、鳥類和海獅為食。
The oldest discovery of an avocado pit comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to 10,000 years ago.	目前發現年代最久遠的酪梨籽來自卡克斯凱特洞穴 (Coxcatlan Cave)，可追溯至約九千至一萬年前。
Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley from around the same time period also show early evidence for the presence of avocado.	其他位於提瓦坎谷區且年代相近的洞穴內也都有證據佐證早年的酪梨蹤影。
There is evidence for avocado use at Norte Chico civilization sites in Peru by at least 3,200 years ago and at Caballo Muerto in Peru from around 3,800 to 4,500 years ago.	祕魯的小北文明 (Norte Chico) 聚落遺址有至少 3,200 年前的酪梨食用證據，該國的卡巴羅穆爾托 (Caballo Muerto) 遺址則出土了大約 3,800 年至 4,500 年前的佐證物件。
The native, undomesticated variety is known as a criollo, and is small, with dark black skin, and contains a large seed.	未經人類馴化的原生種稱為克里奧羅種 (criollo)，體積小且表皮顏色深黑，果實內有碩大的種子。
It probably coevolved with extinct megafauna.	它有可能是與絕種的巨型動物共同演化而來。
The avocado tree also has a long history of cultivation in Central and South America, likely beginning as early as 5,000 BC.	酪梨果樹在中美洲及南美洲等地區有著悠久的栽種歷史，最早可追溯至西元前 5,000 年。
A water jar shaped like an avocado, dating to AD 900, was discovered in the pre-Incan city of Chan Chan.	在印加帝國之前的昌昌 (Chan Chan) 古城內出土了一個西元 900 年的酪梨型水壺。
The earliest known written account of the avocado in Europe is that of Martín Fernández de Enciso (circa 1470–1528) in 1519 in his book, Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo.	目前已知歐洲最早提及酪梨的文獻為 Martín Fernández de Enciso (1470–1528) 於 1519 年出版的《世界地理大全》(Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo)。
The first detailed account that unequivocally describes the avocado was given by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in his work Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias in 1526.	首篇鉅細靡遺描寫酪梨的文獻則為 Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés 於 1526 年出版的《西印度群島自然史概述》(Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias)。
The first written record in English of the use of the word 'avocado' was by Hans Sloane, who coined the term, in a 1696 index of Jamaican plants.	英文中的酪梨 (avocado) 首見於 1696 年出版的《牙買加植物索引》(Index of Jamaican Plants)，由 Hans Sloane 創造出來。
The plant was introduced to Spain in 1601, Indonesia around 1750, Mauritius in 1780, Brazil in 1809, the United States mainland in 1825, South Africa and Australia in the late 19th century, and Israel in 1908.	酪梨於 1601 年引進到西班牙，約莫於 1750 年來到印尼、於 1780 年至模里西斯、1809 年至巴西、1825 年紮根美國、十九世紀晚期來到南非和澳洲，並於 1908 年引進到以色列。
In the United States, the avocado was introduced to Florida and Hawaii in 1833 and in California in 1856.	在美國境內，佛羅里達州及夏威夷均於 1833 年引進酪梨，加州則於 1856 年引進。
Before 1915, the avocado was commonly referred to in California as ahuacate and in Florida as alligator pear.	在 1915 年之前，加州人通常將酪梨稱為「ahuacate/aguacate」，佛州人則稱之為鱷梨 (alligator pear)。
In 1915, the California Avocado Association introduced the then-innovative term avocado to refer to the plant.	1915 年，加州酪梨協會將當時仍相當新穎的「avocado」一詞介紹給普羅大眾，當作正式名稱。
The word "avocado" comes from the Spanish aguacate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ], which goes back to the proto-Aztecan *pa:wa which also meant "avocado".	「avocado」一詞源自於西班牙文中的「aguacate」，再往前可追溯至納瓦特爾語 (Nahuatl) 的「āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ]」，追本溯源則為原始阿茲特克語中的「*pa:wa」，即現今的「酪梨」之意。
Sometimes the Nahuatl word was used with the meaning "testicle", probably because of the likeness between the fruit and the body part.	納瓦特爾語中的酪梨有時候會用來指稱「睪丸」，有可能是因為這種水果長得很像該身體部位。
The modern English name comes from an English rendering of the Spanish aguacate as avogato.	現代的英文名稱則是將西班牙文中的「aguacate」轉譯為「avogato」而來。
The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as "avogato pear", a term which was later corrupted as "alligator pear".	經證實，目前已知最早曾於 1697 在英文的書面文獻中出現「avogato pear」一詞，之後則誤植為「alligator pear」(鱷梨)。 
Because the word avogato sounded like "advocate", several languages reinterpreted it to have that meaning.	因為「avogato」一詞唸起來音似「倡議」(advocate)，有些語言會據此重新詮釋該詞含意。
French uses avocat, which also means lawyer, and "advocate" — forms of the word appear in several Germanic languages, such as the (now obsolete) German Advogato-Birne, the old Danish advokat-pære (today it is called avocado) and the Dutch advocaatpeer.	法文會使用「avocat」來指稱酪梨，該詞同時也有「律師」和「倡議」之意。該詞語的變形也出現在數種日耳曼語系的語言當中，諸如德文的「酪梨」為「Advogato-Birne」(現已過時)、丹麥文的酪梨舊稱為「advokat-pære」(現今已更名為「avocado」)，荷蘭文則是「advocaatpeer」。
In other Central American and Caribbean Spanish-speaking countries, it is known by the Mexican name, while South American Spanish-speaking countries use a Quechua-derived word, palta.	在中美洲以及加勒比海地區的其他西語系國家都使用墨西哥文稱呼酪梨，南美洲的西語系國家則使用源自克丘亞語 (Quenchua) 的「palta」。
In Portuguese, it is abacate.	葡萄牙文中的酪梨為「abacate」。
The fruit is sometimes called an avocado pear or alligator pear (due to its shape and the rough green skin of some cultivars).	該水果有時會被稱為「睪梨」或「鱷梨」(因為其形似睪丸，且某些品種具有粗糙的綠色果皮)。
The Nahuatl āhuacatl can be compounded with other words, as in ahuacamolli, meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word guacamole derives.	納瓦特爾語的「āhuacatl」可以和其他詞語組成複合詞，比如「ahuacamolli」(意思是酪梨湯或酪梨醬汁)。西班牙文中的「酪梨醬」(guacamole) 即源自於此。
In the United Kingdom, the term avocado pear is still sometimes misused as applied when avocados first became commonly available in the 1960s.	當酪梨於 1960 年代首度成為英國常見的蔬果之後，仍然時而有人誤用「avocado pear」(睪梨) 一詞稱之。
Originating as a diminutive in Australian English, a clipped form, avo, has since become a common colloquialism in South Africa and the United Kingdom.	「avo」原為澳洲英文用來簡稱酪梨的省略語，後來成為南非及英國常見的口語詞彙。
It is known as "butter fruit" in parts of India.	酪梨在印度境內的部分地區有「奶油果」之稱。
The subtropical species needs a climate without frost and with little wind.	這種副熱帶水果需要不會結霜且有微風拂面而來的氣候。
High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination.	疾風吹拂會讓濕度降低，導致花苞脫水，進而影響授粉。
When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur, although the 'Hass' cultivar can tolerate temperatures down to −1 °C.	儘管哈斯 (Hass) 酪梨已經可以忍受攝氏零下 1 度的低溫，但即便只有輕微結霜，還是有可能發生提早落果的現象。
Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of Gainesville, Florida, which survive temperatures as low as −6.5 °C (20 °F) with only minor leaf damage.	有些耐寒的品種會種植在佛羅里達州的蓋恩斯維爾 (Gainesville) 地區，能夠在攝氏零下 6.5 度 (華氏 20 度) 的低溫下存活，僅有少數葉子會為此凋萎。
The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep.	果樹本身也需要透氣良好的土壤，理想深度為 1 公尺以上。
According to information published by the Water Footprint Network, it takes an average of approximately 70 litres (18 US gal) of applied fresh ground or surface water, not including rainfall or natural moisture in the soil, to grow one avocado.	據水足跡網絡 (Water Footprint Network) 公開發佈的資訊指出，要種出一株酪梨，平均需要用到大約 70 公升 (約 18 加侖) 的地下或地面的淡水，不包括降雨或土壤中自然含有的水分。
However, the amount of water needed depends on where it is grown; for example, in the main avocado-growing region of Chile, about 320 litres (85 US gal) of applied water are needed to grow one avocado.	然而，所需水量仍取決於生長地區。例如在智利境內的主要酪梨種植區，要種植一株酪梨所需要用到的水量大約是 320 公升 (85 加侖)。
Yield is reduced when the irrigation water is highly saline.	若灌溉用水的鹽分含量高，則產量會隨之減少。
These soil and climate conditions are available in southern and eastern Colombia, Morocco, the Levant, South Africa, Venezuela, Spain, Peru, parts of central and northern Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of southern India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, southern California, Arizona, Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, Hawaii, Ecuador, and Rwanda.	具有這些土壤和氣候條件的地區有哥倫比亞南部和東部地區、摩洛哥、黎凡特地區 (the Levant)、南非、委內瑞拉、西班牙、祕魯、智利中部和北部的部分地區、越南、印尼、印度南部的部分地區、斯里蘭卡、澳洲、紐西蘭、菲律賓、馬來西亞、中美洲、加勒比海地區、墨西哥、南加州、亞利桑那州、波多黎各、德州、佛羅里達州、夏威夷、厄瓜多和盧安達等。
Each region has different cultivars.	每一個地區都有各自不同的品種。
Commercial orchards produce an average of seven tonnes per hectare each year, with some orchards achieving 20 tonnes per hectare.	商業果園的平均產量為每年每公頃七公噸，有些果園的產量可達到每公頃二十公噸。
Biennial bearing can be a problem, with heavy crops in one year being followed by poor yields the next.	二年生植物的特性可能會造成問題，導致某一年盛產但隔年卻產量銳減。
Like the banana, the avocado is a climacteric fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree.	酪梨和香蕉一樣都是更年型水果，會在樹上逐漸成熟，但要在採摘下來之後才會熟透。
Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at 3.3 to 5.6 °C (37.9 to 42.1 °F) until they reach their final destination.	在市面上販售的酪梨會趁果肉生硬且表皮青綠時摘下來，然後冷藏在攝氏 3.3 度至 5.6 度 (華氏 37.9 度至 42.1 度) 中，直到抵達最終站。
Avocados must be mature to ripen properly.	酪梨必須在妥善條件下從成熟至熟透。
Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground.	從樹上掉落的酪梨會在地上熟透腐爛。
Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick 'Hass' avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards.	通常來說，這種水果一旦成熟了就可以摘下來。墨西哥的果農會在哈斯酪梨的乾物質比例達 23% 以上的時候把它摘下來，其他酪梨生產國也有類似的採摘標準。
Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at room temperature (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of ethylene gas).	在摘下來之後，室溫下的酪梨會在一至二週內熟透 (取決於酪梨品種。如果和蘋果或香蕉之類的水果一同儲存，會因為釋放出乙烯氣體的關係而加快熟成速度)。
Some supermarkets sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening.	有些超市會販售以合成乙烯加快熟成速度的完熟酪梨。
The use of an ethylene gas "ripening room", which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of Escondido, California, in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them "back in the bin," and moving on without making a purchase.	使用乙烯氣體的「熟成室」如今已是業界的標準配備，當初是在 1980 年代由加州艾斯康迪多市 (Escondido) 的農民 Gil Henry 開創先河。他在超市的隱藏攝影機畫面中看到顧客重複捏著尚未熟透的硬酪梨，接著把酪梨「物歸原位」，連一顆都不買就繼續往前走，因此才起心動念。
In some cases, avocados can be left on the tree for several months, which is an advantage to commercial growers who seek the greatest return for their crop, but if the fruit remains unpicked for too long, it falls to the ground.	在某些情況下，酪梨可以在樹上待好幾個月，這有利於為自己的農作物尋求最佳報酬的農民。但如果隔了太久仍未採收，果實還是會落地。
Avocados can be propagated by seed, taking roughly four to six years to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing.	酪梨可以透過種子繁殖，大約四到六年就會結果，不過在某些狀況下，種子種下去後會花上十年才會結出果實。
The offspring is unlikely to be identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality.	子代結出的果實品質不見得會與同品種的親代一模一樣。
Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (clonal rootstocks).	因此，優質品種要靠嫁接到由種子繁殖 (實生砧木) 或壓條繁殖 (營養砧木) 的砧木來繁衍後代。
After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted.	大約在溫室中栽植一年後，年輕的砧木就可以準備進行嫁接了。
Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used.	頂端嫁接和側腹嫁接為常用的嫁接方法。
The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold.	接穗品種的幼枝會再栽植 6 至 12 個月才能準備全株出售。
Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.	營養砧木會在需要耐受特定的土壤及疾患條件時雀屏中選，例如土壤的透氣條件不佳，或是要抵禦由疫病菌 (Phytophthora) 造成的土壤病害 (根腐病)。
Commercial avocado production is limited to a small fraction of the vast genetic diversity in the species.	在五花八門的酪梨品種當中，會進行商業量產的酪梨僅限於一小部分。
Conservation of this genetic diversity has relied largely on field collection, as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks.	要保存如此多元的基因樣態，大部分得仰賴田野採集，因為酪梨籽通常無法在種子銀行中長久儲存。
This is problematic, as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive, and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars.	這樣其實十分麻煩，因為要在田野間保存各品種的活株，所費不貲，而且棲地喪失也威脅著野生品種的存續。
More recently, an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees.	近期以來，有人發展出保存種子的替代方法。該方法的基礎構想為以超低溫保存酪梨的體胚，再透過可靠的體胚形成方法重新培植出活株。
Avocado trees are vulnerable to bacterial, viral, fungal, and nutritional diseases (excesses and deficiencies of key minerals).	酪梨果樹對於細菌、病毒、真菌和營養方面的疾病 (過量攝取或缺乏關鍵的礦物質) 幾無招架之力。
Disease can affect all parts of the plant, causing spotting, rotting, cankers, pitting, and discoloration.	疾病會影響到果樹全株，導致表皮出現斑點、腐爛、潰瘍、凹陷和變色。
Mexico is by far the world's largest avocado growing country, producing several times more than the second largest producer.	目前墨西哥是全球最大的酪梨生產國，其產量是第二大生產國的好幾倍。
In 2013, the total area dedicated to avocado production was 188,723 hectares (415,520 acres), and the harvest was 2.03 million tonnes in 2017.	2013 年，專門用來栽植酪梨的區域總面積達到 188,723 公頃 (約 415,520 英畝)。2017 年，收穫量達到 203 萬公噸。
The states that produce the most are México, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, and Michoacan, accounting for 86% of the total.	產量名列前茅的州有墨西哥州、莫雷洛斯州、納亞里特州、普埃布拉州和米卻肯州，加總起來可達到總產量的八成六。
In Michoacán, the cultivation is complicated by the existence of drug cartels that extort protection fees from cultivators.	要在米卻肯州栽種蔬果有相當難度，因為當地的販毒集團會向果農索討保護費。
They are reported to exact 2000 Mexican pesos per hectare from avocado farmers and 1 to 3 pesos/kg of harvested fruit.	據報導指出，酪梨農民每公頃得繳交 2,000 墨西哥披索的保護費，每收成一公斤的酪梨得繳交 1 至 3 披索。
The avocado was introduced from Mexico to California in the 19th century, and has become a successful cash crop.	酪梨於十九世紀從墨西哥引進到加州，並順利成為當地的搖錢樹。
About 59,000 acres (240 km²) – some 95% of United States avocado production – is located in Southern California, with 60% in San Diego County.	大約有 59,000 英畝 (240 平方公里) 的酪梨園 (產量將近為美國酪梨總產量的九成五) 位於南加州，其中有六成位於聖地牙哥郡。
Fallbrook, California claims, without official recognition, the title of "Avocado Capital of the World" (also claimed by the town of Uruapan in Mexico), and both Fallbrook and Carpinteria, California, host annual avocado festivals.	加州的佛布魯克地區自稱為 (尚無官方認證)「世界酪梨之都」(墨西哥的烏魯阿潘鎮也同樣如此自稱)，與加州卡平特里亞市均會舉辦一年一度的酪梨節慶活動。
Avocado is the official fruit of the State of California.	酪梨為加州官方認定的代表水果。
Hass avocado production in Peru encompasses thousands of hectares in central and western Peru.	祕魯的哈斯酪梨產區囊括了中部及西部地區上千公頃的土地。
Peru has now become the largest supplier of avocados imported to the European Union and the second largest supplier to Asia and the United States.	祕魯現已成為歐盟國家第一大進口酪梨供應國，且為亞洲及美國地區的第二大酪梨供應國。
Peru's location near the equator and along the Pacific Ocean creates consistently mild temperatures year round.	祕魯鄰近赤道且位處太平洋沿岸地區，造就當地長年穩定的適溫環境。
The soil is rich and sandy and the towering Andes mountains provide a constant flow of pure water for irrigation.	當地土壤肥沃且土質細緻，高聳的安地斯山脈提供了穩定且純淨的灌溉水源。
Naturally sheltered as it is from heavy rain or freezing temperatures, Peru is an almost perfect climate for the cultivation of avocados.	祕魯的天然環境中既無狂風暴雨也無寒凍低溫，幾乎可說是最適合栽種酪梨的絕佳氣候。
Hass avocados from Peru are seasonally available to consumers from May through September and are promoted under the auspices of the Peruvian Avocado Commission, headquartered in Washington, D.C.	每年五月到九月為祕魯哈斯酪梨的銷售旺季，由總部位於華盛頓特區的祕魯酪梨委員會 (Peruvian Avocado Commission) 負責促銷宣傳等事宜。
Other avocado cultivars include 'Spinks'.	其他酪梨品種還包括了「史賓克斯」(Spinks)。
Historically attested varieties (which may or may not survive among horticulturists) include the 'Challenge', 'Dickinson', 'Kist', 'Queen', 'Rey', 'Royal', 'Sharpless', and 'Taft'.	曾在歷史上真實存在的不同品種 (不一定會在園藝栽種的過程中存留下來) 包括「挑戰」(Challenge)、「狄金森」(Dickinson)、「基斯特」(Kist)、「皇后」(Queen)、「雷伊」 (Rey)、「皇家」(Royal)、「無鋒」(Sharpless) 和「塔夫特」(Taft)。
A stoneless avocado, marketed as a "cocktail avocado," which does not contain a pit, is available on a limited basis.	以「雞尾酒酪梨」之名出現在市面上的無籽酪梨，目前是採限量販售。
They are five to eight centimetres long; the whole fruit may be eaten, including the skin.	長度為五至八公分，可整顆果實連皮一起吃。
It is produced from an unpollinated blossom in which the seed does not develop.	這是由未授粉過的花苞生產而成，種子並未長出來。
Seedless avocados regularly appear on trees.	無籽酪梨經常會出現在樹上。
Known in the avocado industry as "cukes", they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.	在酪梨產業中有「小胡瓜」之稱，通常會因為個頭太小而遭到捨棄，不會上市販賣。
After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect in 1994, Mexico tried exporting avocados to the US.	在北美自由貿易協定 (NAFTA) 於 1994 年正式生效後，墨西哥曾試圖出口酪梨到美國。
The US government resisted, claiming the trade would introduce Tephritidae fruit flies that would destroy California's crops.	美國政府當時拒絕進口，宣稱該項交易會同時引進果蠅，對加州的農作物造成危害。
The Mexican government responded by inviting USDA inspectors to Mexico, but the US government declined, claiming fruit fly inspection was not feasible.	墨西哥政府做出回應，邀請美國農業部 (USDA) 指派監察員前往墨西哥，但美國政府回絕了這項請求，宣稱這樣的果蠅檢查不切實際。
The Mexican government then proposed to sell avocados only to the northeastern US in the winter (fruit flies cannot withstand extreme cold).	墨西哥政府接著提議僅限在冬季銷售酪梨至美國東北部地區 (果蠅無法熬過極度低溫)。
The US government balked, but gave in when the Mexican government started erecting barriers to US corn.	美國政府悍然拒絕，但是在墨西哥政府開始對美國玉米設置壁壘後，還是讓步了。
Imports from Mexico in the 2005–2006 season exceeded 130,000 metric tons (143,300 short tons; 127,900 long tons).	在 2005 年至 2006 年期間，自墨西哥進口的酪梨量超過了 130,000 公噸 (約 143,300 美噸或 127,900 英噸)。
A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.	電腦滑鼠為盈手可握的指向裝置，可偵測相對於同一平面的二維動態。
This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.	一般而言，系統會將平面上的動態轉譯成顯示螢幕上的指標動態，讓圖形化使用者介面得以操控流暢。
The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968.	首度公開展示以滑鼠操控電腦系統的活動於 1968 年舉行。
Originally wired to a computer, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.	原本還得透過線路連接電腦，現代則有許多滑鼠可無線操控，靠著短程無線通訊與系統相互連線。
Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts.	滑鼠原本是透過一顆球體在平面上滾動來偵測動態，不過現代的滑鼠通常都是使用光學感測器，不再含有可動部件。
In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.	除了移動游標之外，電腦滑鼠還會有一個以上的按鈕，可在螢幕上執行如選取選單項目等操作功能。滑鼠通常也會搭配其他元素，好比觸控表面和「滾輪」，以便執行其他操控功能和其他面向的輸入形式。
The earliest known publication of the term mouse as referring to a computer pointing device is in Bill English's July 1965 publication, "Computer-Aided Display Control" likely originating from its resemblance to the shape and size of a mouse, a rodent, with the cord resembling its tail.	目前已知最早公開以滑鼠指稱電腦指向裝置的著作為 Bill English 於 1965 年 7 月發表的「電腦輔助螢幕控制」(Computer-Aided Display Control) 實作報告，靈感可能是源自於它的形狀和大小近似老鼠一般的囓齒動物，再加上有一條像尾巴似的連接線。
The plural for the small rodent is always "mice" in modern usage.	在現代語境中，這種小型囓齒類動物的複數型態都一律稱為「mice」。
The plural of a computer mouse is either "mouses" or "mice" according to most dictionaries, with "mice" being more common.	根據大多數字典的說法，電腦滑鼠的複數型態可以是「mouses」或「mice」，不過有越來越多人使用「mice」。
The first recorded plural usage is "mice"; the online Oxford Dictionaries cites a 1984 use, and earlier uses include J. C. R.	首次有明文記載的複數稱謂則是「mice」。線上版的牛津辭典援引了一筆 1984 年的實際用例，而更早使用的文獻包括了 J. C. R.
Licklider's "The Computer as a Communication Device" of 1968.	Licklider 於 1968 年發表的「淺談電腦通訊裝置」(The Computer as a Commuication Device)。
The term computer mouses may be used informally in some cases.	或許也有人在某些情形下隨意使用「電腦滑鼠」一詞。
Although, the plural of mouse (small rodent) is mice, the two words have undergone a differentiation through usage.	雖然老鼠 (mouse，小型囓齒類動物) 的複數型態為「mice」，但是這兩個字在用法上還是有所分歧。
The trackball, a related pointing device, was invented in 1946 by Ralph Benjamin as part of a post-World War II-era fire-control radar plotting system called Comprehensive Display System (CDS).	軌跡球 (一種與滑鼠相連的指向裝置) 是在 1946 年由 Ralph Benjamin 所發明。當時是戰後名為「全方位顯示系統」(Comprehensive Display System) 的火力管制雷達測繪系統的一部分。
Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service.	Benjamin 當時任職於英國皇家海軍的科學研究部。
Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick.	Benjamin 的計畫使用了類比電腦來計算目標機接下來的位置。計算根據為使用者透過搖桿輸入的幾組初始定位點。
Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a "roller ball" for this purpose.	Benjamin 覺得用來輸入資料的裝置需要更講究好看一些，於是為此發明了當時名為「滾輪球」(roller ball) 的裝置。
The device was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built, and the device was kept as a military secret.	這項裝置於 1947 年獲得專利，不過當時只有打造出將一顆金屬球架在兩片橡皮輪圈上滾動的初始版本，而且是軍事機密。
Another early trackball was built by Kenyon Taylor, a British electrical engineer working in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff.	另一款早期的軌跡球是由一位英國的電機工程師 Kenyon Taylor 與 Tom Cranston 和 Fred Longstaff 聯手打造而成。
Taylor was part of the original Ferranti Canada, working on the Royal Canadian Navy's DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving) system in 1952.	Taylor 當時任職於費朗蒂公司 (Ferranti) 的加拿大分部，於 1952 年負責協助加拿大皇家海軍研發 DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving，數位自動化追蹤及解析) 系統。
DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin's display.	DATAR 在概念上與 Benjamin 展示出來的成品相仿。 
The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions.	該款軌跡球使用四個圓盤來捕捉動態，橫軸及縱軸方向各有兩個。
Several rollers provided mechanical support.	此外還加上幾組滾輪來讓機械運作更為流暢。
When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball.	當球在滾動的時候，負責捕捉動態的圓盤會跟著旋轉，於是圓盤外緣的接觸點會與線路產生週期性接觸，進而產生脈衝輸出並記錄球體的每個動作。
By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined.	透過計算脈衝次數就能判讀球體的實際動向。
A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals.	有一台數位電腦會負責計算軌跡，並使用脈衝編碼調製的無線電訊號將計算結果傳送給艦隊中的其他船艦。
This trackball used a standard Canadian five-pin bowling ball.	這款軌跡球使用的是加拿大的標準版五瓶制保齡球。
It was not patented, since it was a secret military project.	因為是軍事機密，所以並未申請專利。
Douglas Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) has been credited in published books by Thierry Bardini, Paul Ceruzzi, Howard Rheingold, and several others as the inventor of the computer mouse.	史丹佛研究所 (即如今的國際史丹佛研究所，SRI International) 的 Douglas Engelbart 在 Thierry Bardini、Paul Ceruzzi、Howard Rheingold 及其他數名學者的出版著作中被稱為電腦滑鼠的發明者。
Engelbart was also recognized as such in various obituary titles after his death in July 2013.	Engelbart 於 2013 年 7 月逝世之後，也曾在各種訃告消息中以發明者之姿受到表揚。
By 1963, Engelbart had already established a research lab at SRI, the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), to pursue his objective of developing both hardware and software computer technology to "augment" human intelligence.	1963 年，Engelbart 此時已經在 SRI 建立了擴展研究中心 (Augmentation Research Center，簡稱 ARC)，藉此追求他同時發展電腦硬體及軟體技術以「擴展」人類智慧的目標。
That November, while attending a conference on computer graphics in Reno, Nevada, Engelbart began to ponder how to adapt the underlying principles of the planimeter to X-Y coordinate input.	那一年的 11 月，Engelbart 在參加於內華達州雷諾市舉行的電腦圖像學研討會時，開始思考著如何讓求積儀的基本原理得以套用在以 X-Y 軸為基礎的座標輸入上。
On November 14, 1963, he first recorded his thoughts in his personal notebook about something he initially called a "bug," which in a "3-point" form could have a "drop point and 2 orthogonal wheels." He wrote that the "bug" would be "easier" and "more natural" to use, and unlike a stylus, it would stay still when let go, which meant it would be "much better for coordination with the keyboard."	1963 年 11 月 14 日，他首先在自己的筆記本中記下了自己的想法。他一開始將其稱為「蟲」，採「3 點接觸」形式，包括「1 個定位落點和 2 個相互垂直的滾輪」。在他的筆下，他認為這個「蟲」使用起來會「更輕鬆」且「更自然」，而且它不同於一般的記錄探針，只要一放開手，它就會靜止不動，這代表它能夠「與鍵盤更加合作無間」。
In 1964, Bill English joined ARC, where he helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype.	1964 年，Bill English 加入了 ARC，協助 Engelbart 打造出第一個滑鼠原型。
They christened the device the mouse as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail, and in turn resembled the common mouse.	他們將這個裝置命名為「滑鼠」，因為早期的模型會在裝置尾端接上一條線，看起來就像條尾巴，倒轉過來看就如同一般常見的老鼠。
As noted above, this "mouse" was first mentioned in print in a July 1965 report, on which English was the lead author.	如前文所述，「滑鼠」一詞首次出現在於 1965 年 7 月發表的一份報告中，English 為該報告的第一作者。
On 9 December 1968, Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would come to be known as The Mother of All Demos.	1968 年 12 月 9 日，Engelbart 公開演示了這款滑鼠的操作方法，後人譽此為「演示活動之母」(The Mother of All Demos)。
Engelbart never received any royalties for it, as his employer SRI held the patent, which expired before the mouse became widely used in personal computers.	因為該款滑鼠的專利權歸屬 SRI 所有，所以 Engelbart 從未以此收到任何一分版稅。待專利過期之後，滑鼠才開始廣泛運用在個人電腦上。
In any event, the invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart's much larger project of augmenting human intellect.	無論如何，發明滑鼠也就只是 Engelbart 擴展人類智慧的雄心壯志中的一小段插曲。
Several other experimental pointing-devices developed for Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS) exploited different body movements – for example, head-mounted devices attached to the chin or nose – but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience.	之後也有人參照 Engelbart 的聯線系統 (oN-Line System，簡稱 NLS)，利用不同的身體動作研發出其他實驗性的指向裝置 (例如連結到臉頰或鼻子的頭戴式裝置)，但最後滑鼠還是以其速度和便利性取勝。
The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two potentiometers perpendicular to each other and connected to wheels: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis.	第一款滑鼠是個相當笨重的裝置 (如圖所示)，使用了兩組相互垂直且接上滾輪的電位計：每個滾輪都會各自沿著一道軸線轉動。
At the time of the "Mother of All Demos", Engelbart's group had been using their second generation, 3-button mouse for about a year.	在進行「演示活動之母」的時候，Engelbart 的團隊已經使用了第二代的三鍵式滑鼠將近一整年了。
On October 2, 1968, a mouse device named Rollkugel (German for "rolling ball") was described as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal was developed by the German company Telefunken.	據文獻記載，德國的德律風根公司 (Telefunken) 曾於 1968 年 10 月 2 日針對其 SIG-100 終端機研發出名為 Rollkugel (即德文的「滾輪球」) 的滑鼠裝置。
As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball.	不同於 Engelbart 的滑鼠，德律風根的滑鼠裝置可謂「鼠如其名」，真的有一顆球在裡面。
It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named Rollkugel) that was embedded into radar flight control desks.	這是以嵌在雷達飛行控制台內且形似軌跡球的裝置為基礎 (該裝置也叫做 Rollkugel)。
This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken Konstanz for the German Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung (Federal Air Traffic Control) as part of their TR 86 process computer system with its SIG 100-86 vector graphics terminal.	這款軌跡球是在 Rainer Mallebrein 的率領下，由德律風根公司康士坦茲分部的團隊為德國聯邦航管局 (Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung) 研發出來的裝置，為其 TR 86 電腦處理系統和 SIG 100-86 向量式圖像終端機的一部分。
When the development for the Telefunken main frame TR 440 began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team came up with the idea of "reversing" the existing Rollkugel into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device.	當德律風根公司於 1965 年開始研發其 TR 440 主機時，Mallebrein 和他的團隊靈機一動，將現有的 Rollkugel「反轉過來」變成如老鼠般的可動式裝置，讓客戶不用再為早期軌跡球裝置上的諸多安裝孔感到煩躁。
Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968.	在結合了光筆和軌跡球之後，從 1968 年開始成為他們的系統輸入選用裝置。
Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum.	有些滑鼠於 1972 年安裝在慕尼黑的萊布尼茲超級計算中心 (Leibniz-Rechenzentrum) 內，至今仍完好保存在博物館中。
Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.	不過德律風根公司認為這項發明還沒重要到值得為此申請專利。
The Xerox Alto was one of the first computers designed for individual use in 1973 and is regarded as the first modern computer to utilize a mouse.	於 1973 年問世的 Xerox Alto 是最早開始專為個人使用所設計的其中一款電腦，也被認為是第一款運用滑鼠操控的現代化電腦。
Inspired by PARC's Alto, the Lilith, a computer which had been developed by a team around Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zürich between 1978 and 1980, provided a mouse as well.	在帕羅奧多研究中心 (PARC) 推出的 Alto 電腦啟發之下，由蘇黎世聯邦理工學院 (ETH Zürich) 的 Niklaus Wirth 團隊於 1978 年至 1980 年間研發出的 Lilith 電腦也提供了滑鼠裝置。
The third marketed version of an integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the Xerox 8010 Star in 1981.	第三個整合了滑鼠裝置與電腦系統，且做為個人電腦上市販售的是於 1981 年問世的 Xerox 8010 Star。
By 1982, the Xerox 8010 was probably the best-known computer with a mouse.	到了 1982 年，Xerox 8010 可說是當時最知名的有滑鼠的電腦。
The Sun-1 also came with a mouse, and the forthcoming Apple Lisa was rumored to use one, but the peripheral remained obscure; Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold lab mice.	後來的 Sun-1 電腦也附有滑鼠，當時也曾一度謠傳說即將推出的蘋果 Lisa 電腦有使用滑鼠，但結果其周邊裝置還是鮮為人知。經營「滑鼠之家」(The Mouse House) 的 Jack Hawley 曾在報導中表示，有一位來自大公司的買家一開始還認為他在販賣實驗小鼠。
Hawley, who manufactured mice for Xerox, stated that "Practically, I have the market all to myself right now"; a Hawley mouse cost $415.	Hawley 負責為全錄公司製造滑鼠，曾宣稱「我幾乎可說是獨霸當今的滑鼠市場」。當年 Hawley 滑鼠的單價為 415 美元。
In 1982, Logitech introduced the P4 Mouse at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, its first hardware mouse.	1982 年，羅技公司 (Logitech) 在拉斯維加斯的 Comdex 貿易展上正式推出 P4 滑鼠，為旗下第一款硬體滑鼠。
That same year Microsoft made the decision to make the MS-DOS program Microsoft Word mouse-compatible, and developed the first PC-compatible mouse.	同年，微軟公司 (Microsoft) 決定讓 MS-DOS 系統的 Microsoft Word 程式能夠與滑鼠相容，並研發出第一款能與個人電腦相容的滑鼠。
Microsoft's mouse shipped in 1983, thus beginning the Microsoft Hardware division of the company.	微軟的滑鼠於 1983 正式出貨銷售，其硬體部門也就此開始正式營運。
However, the mouse remained relatively obscure until the appearance of the Macintosh 128K (which included an updated version of the Lisa Mouse) in 1984, and of the Amiga 1000 and the Atari ST in 1985.	然而，此時的滑鼠依然未受到重視，直到 Macintosh 128K 型電腦 (內含更新版的 Lisa 滑鼠) 以及 Amiga 1000 型和 Atari ST 型電腦分別於 1984 年和 1985 年出現，才開始受人注目。
Other uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains.	滑鼠的輸入功能也時常在特殊的應用領域中出現其他用途。
In interactive three-dimensional graphics, the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects' or camera's orientation.	在互動式 3D 圖像中，系統通常會將滑鼠的動作直接轉譯為虛擬物件或鏡頭的方向變動。
For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's "head" faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head.	例如，在使用第一人稱視角的射擊遊戲中 (請見下圖)，玩家通常會運用滑鼠來控制虛擬玩家角色的「頭」要往哪邊看：滑鼠往上移，玩家就會往上看，螢幕上則會出現玩家頭上的景象。
A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined.	相關功能也能讓物件圖像旋轉，進而檢視每一個面向。
3D design and animation software often modally chords many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect.	3D 設計和動畫軟體經常會透過程式協調許多不同的動向組合，讓物件和鏡頭得以藉由幾個滑鼠能夠偵測到的軸向運動來進行旋轉，或是在空間中移動。
When mice have more than one button, the software may assign different functions to each button.	若所使用的滑鼠有一個以上的按鍵，則軟體可以分配不同的功能給每一個按鍵。
Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item.	通常來說，滑鼠的主要按鍵 (大多是以右撇子為配置的滑鼠左鍵) 是用來選取項目，次要按鍵 (大多是右撇子配置的滑鼠右鍵) 則是用來開啟可套用在該項目上的其他動作選單。
For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.	例如，若使用具有一個以上按鍵的滑鼠平台，Mozilla 網頁瀏覽器會在使用者點擊主要按鍵之後追蹤到所選取的連結，接著在點擊次要按鍵後跳出快捷選單，選單上有適用於該連結的各項動作。點擊第三 (中央) 滑鼠按鍵則通常會讓瀏覽器另開新分頁或新視窗。
Optical mice rely entirely on one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics.	光學滑鼠全靠一組或多組發光二極體 (LED) 以及能感測影像的光電二極體陣列來偵測相對於滑鼠墊面的動作方向，不再使用機械滑鼠的內建可動部件。
A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (laser) light.	雷射滑鼠為使用同調 (雷射) 光的光學滑鼠。
The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone.	最早出現的光學滑鼠得在預先印製好的滑鼠墊面上偵測動作，現代的 LED 光學滑鼠則能夠大多數不透明的漫反射表面上操作。這類滑鼠通常無法在像拋光岩面般的鏡射表面上偵測動作。
Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces.	雷射二極體也會用來增進解析度和精準度，改善在不透明的鏡射表面上的效能表現。
Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.	使用電池的無線光學滑鼠會為了節省電力讓 LED 光源不停閃爍，只有在偵測到動作時才會穩定發亮。
Often called "air mice" since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other accelerometer (US Patent 4787051) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported.	體感滑鼠 (inertial mouse) 因為不需在平面上操作，通常會被稱作是「空中飛鼠」。這類滑鼠會使用類似音叉的裝置或是其他加速度感測器 (美國專利序號 4787051) 來偵測所有支援軸線上的旋轉動作。
The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation.	最常見的款式 (由羅技公司和 Gyration 公司生產製造) 具有兩個面向的旋轉自由度，並且不會受空間平移所影響。
The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or "gorilla arm".	使用者只要稍微轉一下手腕就能移動游標，減輕其疲勞感或避免出現「猩猩臂膀」(gorilla arm)。
Usually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position.	體感滑鼠通常為無線操作，並設有可在使用過程中關閉動作偵測的開關，讓使用者可以自由擺動而不用擔心會影響到游標定位。
A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use.	有一份體感滑鼠的專利聲明中提到該款滑鼠所消耗的電力比光學滑鼠還要少，而且具有更高的靈敏度、重量更輕，使用起來更方便。
In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.	結合了無線鍵盤的體感滑鼠能夠提供不同以往的人體工學配置，不再需要平滑的工作表面，並可望減輕某些因工作姿勢不良而經年累月產生的傷害。
Also known as bats, flying mice, or wands, these devices generally function through ultrasound and provide at least three degrees of freedom.	也有人稱呼這類裝置為「蝙蝠」、「空中飛鼠」或「魔杖」，一般均可透過超音波進行功能操作，並提供至少三種面向的自由度。
Probably the best known example would be 3Dconnexion ("Logitech's SpaceMouse") from the early 1990s.	最廣為人知的例子大概會是從 1990 年代早期推出的一系列 3Dconnexion 裝置 (如「羅技公司的太空滑鼠」)。
In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse.	Kantek 公司於 1990 年代末推出了 3D 戒指滑鼠。
This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons.	這款無線滑鼠為可戴在手指上的指環裝置，能夠以拇指點擊上面的三個按鍵。
The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.	滑鼠的基站會追蹤滑鼠在三維空間中的移動軌跡。
Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.	儘管頗具吸引力，但最後還是因為無法提供充足的解決方案而黯然退場。
One example of a 2000s consumer 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote.	2000 年後其中一個進入消費市場的 3D 指向裝置範例，就是 Wii 遙控手把 (Wii Remote)。
While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation).	Wii 遙控手把的主要用途為動態感測裝置 (也就是說，它能夠判讀自身的方位和移動方向)，也能透過使用內建的紅外線鏡頭來比較紅外線發射器的光線位置和距離，偵測出自身的空間定位 (因為 Nunchuk 控制器配件並未裝設鏡頭，所以僅能得知自身目前的方向和方位)。
The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar.	這款產品最大的缺點在於它只有在自身鏡頭可以看見條狀感測器時，才能判讀出空間座標。
More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system.	後來消費市場中出現了定位更精準的裝置，包括 PlayStation Move 動態控制器、Razer Hydra 體感控制器，以及 HTC Vive 虛擬實境系統的專屬控制手把。
All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.	這些裝置都能在三維空間中精準偵測出自身定位及方向，無論自身與感測站之間的相對角度有多大。
A mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped.	有個與滑鼠相關的控制器名為 SpaceBall，在工作表面上方設置了一顆能夠輕鬆讓人抓握的球體。
With spring-loaded centering, it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes, in both directions for each.	球體內部裝了彈簧，能夠傳送球體平移以及一共六個方向軸的角度移位動態資訊，每個方向都一視同仁。
In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse.	2010 年 11 月，一間名為 Axsotic 的德國公司推出了新款 3D 概念滑鼠，取名為 3D 球形滑鼠。
This new concept of a true six degree-of-freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations.	這款全新的概念滑鼠為真正具有六面向自由度的輸入裝置，使用了一顆能夠無拘無束進行三軸滾動的球體。
In 2000, Logitech introduced a "tactile mouse" that contained a small actuator to make the mouse vibrate.	2000 年，羅技公司推出「觸覺滑鼠」，內含一組能讓滑鼠震動的小型致動器。
Such a mouse can augment user-interfaces with haptic feedback, such as giving feedback when crossing a window boundary.	這款滑鼠能透過觸覺回饋增強使用者介面體驗，比如在跨越窗框邊界時給予相應的回饋感受。
To surf by touch requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness; this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice but never marketed.	若要透過觸碰來感受衝浪，使用者必須能夠感受到海浪的深度或強度。第一款電流變觸覺滑鼠曾經實現了這項功能，卻從未在市場上販售。
Tablet digitizers are sometimes used with accessories called pucks, devices which rely on absolute positioning, but can be configured for sufficiently mouse-like relative tracking that they are sometimes marketed as mice.	平板電腦數位轉換器有時會和名為「定位盤」(puck) 的配件一起使用。這是需要絕對定位的裝置，但也可以配置幾乎跟滑鼠一模一樣的相對追蹤定位功能，有時會當成滑鼠在市面上販售。
As the name suggests, this type of mouse is intended to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries.	鼠如其名，這一類滑鼠致力於提供最佳的體感舒適度，以及避免發生腕隧道症候群 (carpal tunnel syndrome)、關節炎 (arthritis) 和因為反覆拉扯而造成的傷害。
It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.	其設計以符合自然的手部姿態和動作為要點，藉此減輕不適感。
