Tu was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China, on 30 December 1930.	屠于 1930 年 12 月 30 日生于中国浙江宁波。

— Tu Youyou, when interviewed in 2011 after being awarded the 2011 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award	－ 屠呦呦，访问于 2011 年获得 2011 年度拉斯克临床医学研究奖后。
She attended Xiaoshi Middle School for junior high school and the first year of high school, before transferring to Ningbo Middle School in 1948.	她就读效实初中和效实高中一年级，于 1948 年转至宁波中学。
A tuberculosis infection interrupted her high-school education, but inspired her to go into medical research.	肺结核感染造成她中断了高中学业，但激励她投入医学研究。
From 1951 to 1955, she attended Peking University Medical School / Beijing Medical College.	1951 年到 1955 年，他就读北京大学医学院／北京医学院。

Later Tu was trained for two and a half years in traditional Chinese medicine.	之后屠接受两年半的传统中医训练。
After graduation, Tu worked at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (now the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences) in Beijing.	毕业后，屠在北京中药研究所（今中国科学院中药研究所）工作。

Her uncle, Yao Qingsan (姚庆三), was an economist and banker.	舅舅姚庆三是经济学家、银行家。
Tu carried on her work in the 1960s and 70s during China's Cultural Revolution, when scientists were denigrated as one of the nine black categories in society according to Maoist theory (or possibly that of the Gang of Four).	屠在 1960 年代到 70 年代间文化大革命时间开始工作，当时根据毛理论（或四人帮的说法），科学家被打为黑九类之一。
During her early years in research, Tu studied Lobelia chinensis, a traditional Chinese medicine for curing schistosomiasis, caused by trematodes which infect the urinary tract or the intestines, which was widespread in the first half of the 20th century in South China.	在屠的研究初期研究半边莲，这是一种治疗血吸虫病的传统中药，由感染泌尿道或肠道的吸虫引起，在20世纪上半叶在华南很普遍。
In 1967, during the Vietnam War, Ho Chi Minh, the leader of North Vietnam (which was at war against South Vietnam and the United States), asked Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai for help in developing a malaria treatment for his soldiers trooping down the Ho Chi Minh trail, where a majority came down with a form of malaria which is resistant to chloroquine.	1967 年越战期间，北越领导人胡志明（当时与南越和美国对抗）询问中国总理周恩来，是否可以为其在胡志明小径行军的士兵开发一种疟疾药，当时许多人因为一种抗氯奎宁的疟疾而病倒。
Because malaria was also a major cause of death in China's southern provinces, including Hainan, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, Zhou Enlai convinced Mao Zedong to set up a secret drug discovery project named Project 523 after its starting date, 23 May 1967.	因为疟疾同时也是中国南方各省，包括海南、云南、广东的主要死因，周恩来说服毛泽东，成立一个秘密新药计画，由于计画展开日期为 1967 年 5 月 23 日，该计画就名为 523 计画。
In early 1969, Tu was appointed head of the Project 523 research group at her institute.	1969 年初，屠在其研究机构中被选为 523 计画的领导人。
Tu was initially sent to Hainan where she studied patients who had been infected with the disease.	一开始时，屠到海南研究感染该病症的病人。
Scientists worldwide had screened over 240,000 compounds without success.	全球科学家试了 240,000 种药方，都没有成功。
In 1969, Tu, then 39 years old, had an idea of screening Chinese herbs.	1969 年，当屠 39 岁时，想到可以用中药来试验。
She first investigated the Chinese medical classics in history, visiting practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine all over the country on her own.	她先查阅历史上的各种中药方，且亲自访问全国各地的中医师。
She gathered her findings in a notebook called A Collection of Single Practical Prescriptions for Anti-Malaria.	她将自己的发现写在一本名为《抗疟疾单一实用处方汇集》的笔记本中。
Her notebook summarized 640 prescriptions.	笔记本中记载 640 种处方。

One compound was effective, sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua), which was used for "intermittent fevers," a hallmark of malaria.	有种以黄花蒿（Artemisia annua）为主的处方是有效的，主要用于治疗疟疾的一种征状－间歇热。
As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, "Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve".	屠在计画研讨会上演说时，有人说她的演说就像 1,600 年一本医书的标题「肘后备急方」的标题一样。
At first, it was ineffective because they extracted it with traditional boiling water.	一开始，因为团队以传统滚水法来萃取，因此无效。
Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant; Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong, which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.	屠呦呦发现，以低温萃取程序，可以从植物中分离出有效的抗疟成分；屠说，这是受到由葛洪于西元 340 年撰写的传统草药紧急处方医书的影响，书中说这种草药必须以冷水浸泡。

The airport was built in 1936 during Japanese rule with its origins as a Japanese military airbase, the Taihoku Airfield (Japanese: 臺北飛行場 Hepburn: Taihoku Hikōjō), also known as Matsuyama Airfield (松山飛行場).	本机场建于1936年的日本统治时期，原为日本空军机场，当时称为台北飞行场，又称松山飞行场。
After World War II, in 1946, it was taken over by the Republic of China Air Force.	二次世界大战之后的1946年，由中华民国空军取得。
Before the end of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the airport provided flight routes between Shanghai and Taipei, occasionally via Fuzhou.	在中国内战结束、中华人民共和国政府成立之前，该机场提供台北上海航线，有时也飞往福州。
Shared military and civilian use—both domestic and international—began on 16 April 1950 in the reconstructed Civil Aeronautics Administration Taipei Airport (交通部民用航空局台北航空站).	1950年4月16日起，改组的交通部民用航空局台北航空站，将该机场设为军事与民航两用， 包括国内与国际航线。
Domestic destinations have been Kaohsiung, Hualien, Taichung, Penghu, and Tainan.	国内航线曾包括高雄、花莲、台中、澎湖与台南航线。
The first international destinations were Seattle, Tokyo, Pusan, Manila, Bangkok, and Hong Kong.	最初开始飞行的国际航线包括西雅图、 东京、釜山、马尼拉、曼谷、香港。
The first international airlines included Northwest Airlines, Pan American Airlines, and Hong Kong Airways (now Cathay Pacific).	最初的国际航空公司包括西北航空、泛美航空、香港航空（现在的国泰航空）。
Later, the airport became too small to handle an increased number of passengers, even after a series of expansions.	之后， 即使在历经几次扩建之后， 该机场还是太小而无法容纳增加的旅客。
This later worsened when new wide-body jets became common at the airport.	之后该机场的广体客机增加， 情况更为恶化。
Therefore, all international activities were relocated to Taoyuan International Airport (then known as Chiang Kai-shek International) after its inauguration on 26 February 1979.	因此，所有国际航班都转移到于1979年2月26日启用的桃园国际机场（当时称做中正国际机场）。
Consequently, the passenger load at the airport dropped from 6.2 million in 1978 to 2.9 million in 1979 (a 53% decrease).	此后该机场的乘客容量从1978年的6,200,000人，降到1979年的2,900,000人（下降53%）。
At its peak in 1997, the airport handled over 15.3 million passengers annually.	1997年该机场的乘客人数达到高峰， 一年超过1,530万人。
Service to Taichung and Chiayi was stopped in mid-2007 after the load factor dropped significantly due to Taiwan High Speed Rail start of revenue service in January 2007.	2007年1月台湾高铁开始商业营运之后，由于往台中与嘉义的乘客人数大幅下降，这两条航线于2007年中停止服务。
Passenger volume decreased from 6.7 million in 2006 to 4.4 million in 2007 (a 34% decrease).	乘客人数自2006年的6,700,000下降到2007年的4,400,000（下降34%）。
Also due to the opening of the high speed rail line, on 1 March 2008, Uni Air suspended its service to Kaohsiung, while Far Eastern Air Transport suspended its service to Tainan.	同时在高铁开始营运的影响下， 2008年3月1日起，立荣航空停止飞往高雄的服务，远东航空则停止飞往台南的服务。
TransAsia Airways decided to stop flights to Tainan and Kaohsiung after 1 August 2008.	复兴航空则决定自2008年8月1日起，停止飞航台南与高雄。
In early 1999 when the construction of Taipei 101 had just started, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration changed this airport's certain SID and STAR procedures to avoid possible collision with the building.	1999年初当台北101开始兴建时，台湾民用航空局改变机场的某些 SID 与 STAR 程序， 避免可能的撞击事件。
The 677-meter Fuxing North Road Underground Passage (復興北路車行地下道) was constructed between 1997 and 2006 under this airport's runway to link the north and south side of this airport.	677公尺长的复兴北路车行地下道，于1997到2006年之间在机场跑道下方施工，以联通该机场的南端和北端。
Regular cross-Strait charter flights to China started on 4 July 2008, with Songshan receiving the majority of flights.	自 2008年7月4日起飞往中国的定期跨海峡包机开始飞行， 大部分班机在松山机场起降。
Direct flights to China were an issue of contention.	往中国的直飞班机是争论的焦点。
Then-mayor Ma Ying-jeou had been pressing to make Songshan Airport Taipei's main International terminal, citing that its location close to the city center would make it preferable for business travelers.	剈市长马英九曾经推动松山机场成为台北主要的国际机场，因为该机场靠近台北市中心，对商务旅客来说非常方便。
However, building height restrictions around the airport raised concerns about flight safety, blocking of radio communications, noise pollution, and a reduced number of flights.	然而， 机场附近的建筑线高造成诸如飞航安全问题、 无线电通讯阻扰、 噪音污染， 必须减少航班。
The continuing growth of Taipei City means that Songshan airport is situated in the heart of downtown Taipei.	台北市区的不断成长，也使得松山机场所在地变成台北市中心区域。
Compared to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Songshan Airport saves travelers about 30 minutes due to its location inside Taipei City's central business district, but the city suffers from the noise, pollution, restrictions on urban planning, and traffic congestion the airport brings about.	和台湾桃园国际机场相比，松山机场让旅客节省约30分钟，因为他就正在市区正中心的商业区；但是机场也为台北市带来噪音、污染、 都市计划限制和交通拥挤等问题。
In the 2002 and 2006 Taipei Mayor Election DPP candidates Lee Ying-yuan and Frank Hsieh both proposed the plan to close Songshan Airport, and developed its land into road, huge park, detention basin and sports arena, since the Taiwan High Speed Rail could quickly take up the traffic load between Taipei and western Taiwan cities, and the remaining service to outlying islands and eastern Taiwan could be easily taken over by the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after the completion of Taoyuan International Airport Access MRT System by the end of 2016.	2002年与2006年，民进党的台北市长候选人李应元与谢长廷，两人都主张关闭松山机场，将其用地发展为道路、大型公园、 滞洪池与运动区， 因为台湾高铁可以快速承担台北到其他台湾西部城市的交通，而在桃园国际机场捷运在2016年底完成之后，松山机场剩余的功能，包括飞往离岛与台湾东部，可以由台湾桃园国际机场取代。
Also, the MRT system will make the international potential of Songshan airport less attractive.	同时，机场捷运也会让松山机场的国际航线功能变得比较没有吸引力。
The Songshan Airport closing proposal was deferred under the Taipei City Government which has long been dominated by the Pan-Blue Coalition, who prefers the downtown airport connection concept with Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo.	长期由泛蓝阵营执政的台北市政府，则反对关闭松山机场的提案， 他们比较偏好以市区机场连接上海、首尔、东京的构想。
Due to the introduction of Taiwan-China flights and future international potential, the airport is undergoing extensive renovations, the first phase of which is expected to be completed by October 2010.	由于导入台湾中国直飞航线以及未来国际航线的需求，该机场正在进行大规模的改建，第一期预计在2010年10月前完成。

On 29 March 2011, the renovated Terminal 2 was re-opened to handle domestic flights.	2011年3月29日，重新改建的第二航厦重新开幕，供国内航线使用。
Songshan Airport is seen to have the potential to attract business travelers within Pacific Asia due to its location in downtown Taipei.	松山机场因为位于台北市区，对于亚太区的商务旅客相当有吸引力。
Flights to Bangkok–Don Mueang, Jakarta–Halim Perdanakusuma, Kuala Lumpur–Subang, Singapore–Seletar, Nagoya–Komaki, Osaka–Itami, Seoul–Gimpo, Shanghai–Hongqiao, Beijing–Nanyuan, and Tokyo–Haneda are especially attractive since these airports are also in the central areas of their respective cities, and all these cities have larger far flung international airports.	飞往曼谷廊曼、 雅加达哈林帕达纳克苏玛国际机场、吉隆坡梳邦机场、 新加坡实里达机场、 名古屋小牧机场、 大阪伊丹机场、 首尔金浦机场、上海虹桥机场，北京南苑机场、东京羽田机场的航班特别受欢迎， 因为这些机场都位在市中心， 在较远的郊区有更大的国际机场。
The airport is currently in the process of expansion to better accommodate international flights.	该机场目前正在扩建，以容纳更多国际航班。

It came back to prominence during early Liao dynasty and was known as the Shen Prefecture (瀋州; Shěn Zhōu) through to the end of Jin dynasty, and became the Shenyang Circuit (瀋陽路; Shěnyáng Lù) during the Yuan dynasty.	该城在辽朝初年重新恢复荣景，到金末期间称为沈州，在元朝成为沈阳路。
During the Ming dynasty, it was designated as a "guard town" (militarized settlements, such as walled/heavily garrisoned cities or towns) named Shenyang Central Guard (瀋陽中衛; Shěnyáng Zhōngwèi) and gradually became one of the most important strongholds beyond the Shanhai Pass.	明代，该城被指定为为「卫城」（具备军事设施的城市，例如城墙、重兵驻守）， 称为沈阳中卫， 并且逐渐成为山海关外最重要的军事据点。
In 1625, the Manchu leader Nurhaci captured Shenyang and decided to relocate his entire administrative infrastructures to the city, or Simiyan hoton (Manchu: ᠰᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠨ	1625年，满州领袖努尔哈赤占领沈阳， 并将整个行政架构移到该城，在满语中又称  Simiyan hoton (满语： ᠰᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠨ

The official name was changed to Shengjing (盛京; Shèng Jīng; 'rising capital'), or Mukden (Manchu: ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠨ), in 1634.	1634年，官方名称正式更改为盛京，或是满语的 Mukden ( ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠨ)。
The new name derives from the Manchu word, mukdembi (Manchu: ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠮᠪᡳ), meaning "to rise" as reflected also by its Han Chinese name.	新的名称 mukdembi ( ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠮᠪᡳ) 在满语中的意思是上升， 也符合其汉语名字。
Under Nurhaci's orders, the Imperial Palace was constructed in 1626, symbolizing the city's emerging status as the Jurchen political center.	1626年，努尔哈赤下令建造皇宫， 象征改成成为女真人的政治中心。

After the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan coerced the annexation of the Liaodong Peninsula with the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, though was forced to give it up due to diplomatic pressure from the Triple Intervention.	第一次中日战争后，日本于1895年以《马关条约》胁迫吞并辽东半岛，但由于三国干预的外交压力，日本被迫放弃该条约。
In the aftermath of the Japanese threat, Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang visited Moscow in 1896 and signed a secret treaty with Russian foreign minister Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, allowing Imperial Russia to build a Russian gauge railway in Manchuria, which opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of another lease convention in 1898, effectively allowing Russia to annex Port Arthur in all but name.	在日本威胁之后，清朝总督李鸿章于1896年访问了莫斯科，并与俄罗斯外交部长阿列克谢・洛巴诺夫-罗斯托夫斯基签署密约，允许俄罗斯帝国在满洲建造一条俄罗斯轨距铁路，这为1898年以另一项租赁公约的形式进一步的俄罗斯扩张主义打开了大门，让俄罗斯除了名义上以外，完全有效吞并旅顺口区。
However, after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Russian forces used the anti-foreigner insurgency as a pretext to formally invade and occupied most of Manchuria, and Mukden became a Russian stronghold in the Far East with the building of the South Manchurian Railway.	然而，1900年义和团之乱后，俄罗斯军队以对抗外国入侵为借口，正式入侵占领了满洲大部分地区，随着南满铁路的建设， 沈阳成为俄罗斯在远东的据点。
During the Russo-Japanese War (1904—1905), Mukden was the site of the Battle of Mukden from February 19 to March 10, 1905. Involving more than 600,000 combat participants, it was the largest battle since the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, and also the largest modern-era battle ever fought in Asia before World War II.	在日俄战争（1904-1905年）期间，沈阳是1905年2月19日至3月10日沈阳战役的发生地。这是自1813年莱比锡战役以来规模最大的战役，60多万人参加战斗，也是二战前亚洲有史以来规模最大的现代战役。
Following the Japanese victory, Mukden became one of the chief bases of Japanese presence and economic expansion into southern Manchuria.	日本获胜后，沈阳成为日本向满洲南部进行占领与经济扩张的主要基地之一。
It also became the government seat of Fengtian province in 1910.	1910年成为奉天省省会。
In 1914, the city changed back to its old name Shenyang, but continued to be known as Mukden (sometimes spelled Moukden) in some English sources and in Japan through much of the first half of 20th century.	1914年，该城市回复旧名沈阳，但在20世纪上半叶的大部分时间里，在一些英语和日本文献中，还是称之为 Mukden（有时拼写为Moukden）。
The postmark of the Chinese postal administration kept the spelling "MOUKDEN/奉天" for usage on international mails until the late 1920s.	直到20世纪20年代末，中国邮政当局的国际邮件邮戳一直保留「MOUKDEN/奉天」的拼写方式。
After that, a Chinese–Manchurian bilingual type "SHENYANG (MUKDEN)/瀋陽 (奉天)" datestamp was used until 1933.	此后，中文-满洲语双语型的「沈阳（MUKDEN）/沈阳（奉天）」日期戳章一直沿用到1933年。
In the early 20th century, Shenyang began expanding out of its old city walls.	20世纪初期，沈阳开始将其城区扩展到旧城墙之外。
The Shenyang Railway Station on the South Manchurian Railway and the Shenyang North Railway Station on the Jingfeng Railway, both west of the old city, became the new commercial centers of Shenyang.	南满铁路上的沈阳车站，以及京奉铁路上的沈阳北站，两站都在旧城区的西边，成为沈阳的新商业中心。
In the 1920s, Mukden was the capital of the warlord Zhang Zuolin, who was later assassinated when his train was blown up on 4 June 1928 at a Japanese-guarded railway bridge.	在1920年代，沈阳成为军阀张作霖的都城，1928年6月4日，张作霖在 在自己的火车经过由日本军看守的铁路桥上遭到炸死。

The Imperial Japanese Army, accusing Chinese dissidents of the act, then use the false flag explosion as pretext to launch a full attack on Mukden, and captured the city the following morning (September 19).	日本帝国陆军指责中国持不同政见者的行为，然后以假旗帜爆炸当做借口对奉天发动全面攻击，并在第二天早上（9月19日）占领了该市。
After the Mukden Incident, the Japanese further invaded and occupied the rest of Northeast China, and created the puppet state of Manchukuo with the deposed emperor Aisin Gioro Puyi as the figurehead.	奉天事件发生后，日本人进一步入侵并占领东北地区，并建立了傀儡国满洲国，由退位皇帝爱新觉罗・溥仪担任傀儡。
During the Manchukuo era (1932–1945), the city was again called Fengtian (and Mukden in English), and was developed by the Japanese into a center of heavy industry.	在满洲国时代（1932-1945年），这座城市再次被称为奉天（英语为Mukden），日本人将其发展成为重工业中心。
Japan was able to exploit resources in Manchuria using the extensive network of railroads.	日本人可以透过绵密的铁路网，榨取满洲里的资源。
For example, vast expanses of Manchurian forest were chopped down.	举例来说，满洲里有大量的森林遭到砍伐。
The development of Shenyang was also unbalanced in this period; municipal facilities were mostly located in Japanese residential areas, while Chinese residential areas had poor living conditions.	这个时期的沈阳发展也非常不均衡；各种是正设施多半集中于日本人的居住区，而中国人居住的地方生活条件非常差。
Under Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky, the Far East Command of Soviet forces entered Manchuria in early August 1945 following the surrender of Japan.	在苏联元帅Aleksandr Vasilevsky的主政下，在日本投降后，苏联军队远东司令部于1945年8月初进入满洲。

During the Chinese Civil War, Shenyang remained a Kuomintang stronghold from 1946 to 1948, although the Chinese communists controlled the surrounding countryside.	在中国内战期间，沈阳从1946年到1948年一直是国民党的据点，不过中国共产党控制了周围的农村。
It was captured by the communists on October 30, 1948, following a series of offensives known as the Liaoshen Campaign.	在一连串称作辽西会战的攻击后，共产党于1948年10月30日占领沈阳。
Over the past 200 years or so, Shenyang managed to grow and increase its industrial might, despite consecutive wars with Russia and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second World War, and China's Civil War (Shenyang became the main battleground between the Communists and Nationalists).	在过去的200年左右的时间里，尽管在19世纪末和20世纪初与俄罗斯和日本连续发生战争，又历娙第二次世界大战和中国内战（沈阳成为共产党和国民党间的主要战场），沈阳还是设法增长并强化其工业实力。
The old city of Shenyang resided almost entirely within the modern day Shenhe District, and used to have two city walls.	沈阳旧城几乎完全居于在当代的沈河区，曾有两道城墙。
Situated roughly within the area bounded by the four "Shuncheng" (顺城; 'along the city walls') roads/streets in Shenhe District, the (now-demolished) square-shaped inner city wall marked the bounds of ancient Shenyang.	（现已拆除的）方形内城墙，大致位于沈河区四条「顺城」道路/街道的范围内，代表着旧时沈阳的边界。
The earliest wall was built in 926 during early Liao dynasty to settle Northern Song civilians the Khitans abducted from raids to use as slave labourers, and was then made of rammed earth because the city was merely a small settlement at the time (historically the administrative center of the Liaodong region was at Liaoyang).	最早的城墙建于926年，在辽朝早期，用于安置由契丹人突袭中绑架而来的北宋居民，用作奴工；城墙由夯土制成，因为当时这座城市只是一个小据点（历史上，辽东地区的行政中心在辽阳）。
However, in 1368, Hongwu Emperor of the newly founded Ming dynasty ordered a new regional military command—the Liaodong Regional Military Commission (遼東都指揮使司)—to be established, and Shenyang was made a prominent regional "guard town" (衛所).	然而，1368年，新建国的明朝洪武皇帝，下令成立一个新的地区军事指挥部——辽东都指挥使司，沈阳成为一个著名的区域卫所。
In 1388, Min Zhong (閔忠), the newly appointed city commissioner of the Shenyang Central Guard, wrote to Hongwu Emperor immediately upon his tenure requesting permission to upgrade the city wall, and the old wall was made taller and thoroughly reinforced with overlaid bricks.	1388年，沈阳中央卫队新任命的行政首长闵忠，在上任后立即上书给洪武皇帝，请求准许升级城墙，旧城墙变得更高，并以砖块覆盖彻底加固。
According to History of Ming, the reconstructed Ming-era wall was 2.5 zhàngs (8 metres or 26 feet) tall, more than 1 zhàng (3.2 metres or 10.5 feet) wide at the top, and 9 lis and 30 bus (about 5.2 kilometres or 3.2 miles) long.	根据明朝历史，重建的明代城墙高2.5丈（8米或26英尺），顶部宽超过1丈（3.2米或10.5英尺），长9里和30步（约5.2公里或3.2英里）。
It has two layers of moats dug outside, each being 3 zhàngs (9.6 metres or 31.5 feet) wide and 8 chis (2.56 metres or 8 feet 4.8 inches) deep, fed with water from Shen River.	城外挖了两层护城河，每层宽3丈（9.6米或31.5英尺），深8丈（2.56米或8英尺4.8英寸），灌入沈河的水。
There were four city gates, each at the center of one side, connected by two main roads that intersected at Central Temple of the city's center in a "+" fashion.	有四个城门，每道城门都在一边的中心点，由两条主要道路相连；两条主要道路以「+」的方式在市中心的中央寺庙交会。
This Ming wall was heavily damaged in 1625 after the Manchu laid siege and captured the city, with only the north wall and gate (which had undergone reinforcing reconstructions in 1545 under the orders of Jiajing Emperor) remained intact.	1625年满洲人包围并占领该市后，这堵明城墙严重受损，只有北墙和大门（在嘉靖皇帝命令下，在1545年进行强化重建）完好无损。
The Manchu leader Nurhachi however saw the strategic value of the city, and decided to formally relocate his Later Jin capital from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and ordered the city wall to be rebuilt.	然而，满族领袖努尔哈赤看出这座城市的战略价值，决定将金朝首都从辽阳正式迁至沈阳，并下令重建城墙。
According to Annals of Mukden (盛京通志), the new city wall was a standard black brick wall standing at a height of 3.5 zhàngs (about 12.5 metres or 41.0 feet), a width of 1.8 zhàngs (about 6.4 metres or 21.0 feet) and a total length of 9 lis and 332 bus (about 6.4 kilometres or 4.0 miles) long, complete with 12 towers (8 gate and 4 corner) and a 14.5 zhàngs (about 52-metre or 171-foot) wide moat.	根据《盛京通志》，新城墙是一堵标准的黑砖墙，高度为3.5 丈（约12.5米或41.0英尺），宽度为1.8 丈（约6.4米或21.0英尺），总长度为9 里 332 步（约6.4公里或4.0英里），配有12座塔楼（8个大门和4个角落），护城河宽 14.5 丈（约52米或171英尺）。
The city gates were increased from four to eight, though the old Ming-era north gate and tower was preserved but sealed shut, later known as the "Ninth Gate" (九門).	后城门从四个增加到八个，尽管古老的明时代北门和塔楼保留下来，但密封关闭，后来称为「九门」。
The outer city wall, called the "peripheral wall" (邊牆; Biān Qiáng) or "pass wall" (關牆; Guān Qiáng), was actually a rammed earth rampart built in 1680 to expand the urban area outside the inner city.	外城墙称为「边墙」或「关墙」，实际上是一座建于1680年的夯土墙，旨在将城区扩及内城之外。
It was almost round in shape, standing at a height of 7.5 chis (around 2.7 metres or 8 feet 10.3 inches) and an overall length of 32 lis and 24 bus (about 20.7 kilometres or 12.9 miles), and also had eight gates known as the "peripheral gates" (邊門; Biān Mén).	它大致是圆形的，高度为7.5尺（约2.7米或8英尺10.3英寸），总长度为32英里24步（约20.7公里或12.9英里），还有8个被称为「边门」。
The corresponding inner and outer gates were linked by roads that intersected within the inner city in a "#" pattern around the Mukden Palace.	对应的内门和外门之间，连结有在城内交叉的道路，在沈阳故宫周围以「#」图案交叉。
Nearly all of these city walls and gates were demolished after 1949.	所有的城墙和城门，在1949年后几乎都被摧毁。
Two gates and one corner tower of the inner wall were rebuilt during the 1990s.	1990年代， 内城墙有两个城门和一个角落的塔楼重建起来。
There had, however, been proposals to rebuild the other gates and towers in preparation to the 12th National Games in 2013.	然而，有人提议重建其他大门和塔楼，为2013年 中华人民共和国第12届运动会做准备。
Around 2.5 km (1.6 mi) outside Shenyang's former outer wall, there were four pagodas each located within an associated Tibetan buddhist temple, namely the East Pagoda in Yongguang Temple (永光寺), the South Pagoda in Guangci Temple (廣慈寺), the West Pagoda in Yanshou Temple (延壽寺) and the North Pagoda in Falun Temple (法輪寺).	在沈阳旧外墙外约2.5公里（1.6英里），有四座宝塔，各自位于相关的藏传佛教寺内，即永光寺的东塔、广慈寺的南塔、延寿寺的西塔和法轮寺的北塔。
They were built in 1643 and completed in 1645.	这些宝塔于1643年开始兴建，于1645年完成。
The four pagodas are identical white Buddha-stupas as tall as 26 m (85 ft).	这四座宝塔是相同的白色佛像，高达26米（85英尺）。
Nowadays only the temple for the North Pagoda is well preserved, the East and South has only the pagodas left, and the temple for the West Pagoda was rebuilt in 1998.	如今，只有北塔的寺庙保存完好，东边和南边只剩下宝塔，西塔的寺庙于1998年重建。
Both the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth were also to be found in the old city during the Qing dynasty.	清朝期间，在旧城区也有天坛和地坛。
They were smaller replicas of Beijing's counterparts.	其为北京天坛地坛的缩小版。

These are reinforced on the peripheries by smaller rivers such as Xi River (细河), Puhe River (蒲河) and Mantang River (满堂河), and drains into the Hun River at three different locations on the southeast, due south and southwest side of the city.	特别是南运河，以其沿线的成排公园和花园而闻名，建在万泉河的旧河道上，历史上也被称为小沈河或五里河，是旧城区的主要水源。外侧有细河、普河和曼塘河（曼塘河）等较小的河流，在该市的东南侧和西南侧三个不同位置汇入浑河。
