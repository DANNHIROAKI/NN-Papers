God is the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful,
The Day of the Day of Judgment
You worship us, and You alone help us.
Guide us on the right path.
The path of those whom You have favoured, not of those who have incurred anger, nor of those who go astray.
Alif. Lam. Mim.
This is the Book in which there is no doubt, and a guidance for those who fear Allah.
Who believe in the unseen, and establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and in the Hereafter they are certain.
These are on the right path from their Lord, and these are the ones who are successful.
As for those who disbelieve, it is not for them whether you warn them or warn them.
God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil, and there is a great punishment.
And of the people are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers.
They deceive God and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, and perceive not.
There is a sickness in their hearts, and God has increased their disease. Theirs is a painful punishment for them.
And when it is said to them, “Do not cause corruption on the earth,” they say, “We are only reformers.”
Nay, they are the ignorant, and they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people believe," they say, "Shall we believe as we believe?" They say, "We believe as we believe."
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, "We are with you, we were only mocking."
Allah mocks them, and they wander in their insolence, and they are in their error.
Those are they who buy error for guidance, so their trade will not profit them, nor were they guided.
Their likeness is like a one who kindled a fire, but when it lit all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, and they see not.
deaf, dumb, dumb, and blind.
Or, as it is like the sky, the lightning, the thunder, and the lightning, and those who put their fingers in their ears, in their ears, in their ears, and Allah encompasses the unbelievers. God encompasses the unbelievers.
It is the lightning of their eyes, when it covers them, and when it comes to pass, it is in it, and when they change their hearts, they turn away, and if Allah willed, He will remove their eyes, and Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord Who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous.
Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky, and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth fruits for you for sustenance; then do not set up rivals to Allah with what you know.
And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it, and call your witnesses besides Allah if you are truthful.
But if you cannot do it, and you will not do it, then guard the fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the unbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds; for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will say, "This is what we have provided." They will say, "This is what we have given before." They will be provided for them, and they will live therein, and they will abide therein.
God is not ashamed to speak to a gnat or a gnat. But those who believe will know that it is the truth from their Lord. But those who disbelieve say, "What is the matter with God?" But those who disbelieve, say, "This is what is what is with God." But He sends astray many of them, and He guides many of them.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the land; these are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will cause you to die, and to Him you shall be returned.
It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, and then ascended to heaven, then He gave them seven heavens, and He has created all things.
And when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a vicegerent in the earth,” they said, “Will you place it in place of security and shed blood?”
And He taught Adam all the names, then He placed them to the angels and said: "Tell Me the names of the names of these, if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." He said, "Did I not tell you of the secrets of the heavens and the earth? I know that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you disclose."
And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam," but he refused to prostrate him, but he refused to be arrogant and arrogant.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the garden, and eat of it; and eat not this tree, lest ye approach this tree, lest ye be of the unjust.
Then Satan made them slip from them, and they made it out of what they were in it, and We said: "Go forth from it, and you shall be enemies of one another. And for you there is a provision and a provision for you."
Then Adam received from his Lord words of inspiration, and He relented towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
We said: Go down from all of you, and if there comes to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, etc.) are they who are destined to abide in the fire, and they will abide therein.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant, and fulfill My covenant with Me.
And believe in what is with you, confirming what is with you, and reject not the first of My revelations, and do not sell My revelations for a trifling price.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth.
And establish prayer and pay the prayer and bow down before those who bow down.
Do you enjoin people to do good deeds, and forget yourselves while you read the Scripture? Do you not understand?
And seek help in patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humble ones.
Those who think that they will meet their Lord and to Him they will return.
O Children of Israel! remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I made you excel the nations.
And guard yourselves on a Day when no soul will avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And remember when We saved you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women; and there was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We made the sea for you, and saved you, and drowned Pharaoh and drowned the people of Pharaoh.
And when We appointed for Moses forty nights, then you took a calf after him, and you were unjust.
Then We pardoned you so that you may be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the criterion that you may be guided.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed I have wronged you for a calf, so repent to your Maker, and kill yourselves, and kill you. He is the best of you. He has mercy on you, and He is the Most Merciful, the Merciful."
And when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see God, and you see a thunderbolt while you see."
Then We revived you after death, that you may be grateful.
And We shaded the clouds with clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails, saying, "Eat with good things, and we have not wronged ourselves."
And (remember) when We said: Enter this town and eat of it, and eat of it wherever you eat, and enter the gate, and say, "Our sins, we will forgive you, and We will give you the good deeds."
But those who did wrong changed the words of what was told them, and We sent down upon them the punishment of a sky from heaven, from heaven.
And remember when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said: Strike your rock with thy staff; and twelve springs gushed forth from twelve springs, and every tribe gushed forth from its drinking. And eat the sustenance of Allah, and do not act corruptly in the land.
And when they said, "O Moses, we shall not be patient for any food, and our Lord's house, and its cattle." He said, "What is better for us?" He said, "It is better for us." He said, "Do it be better for us?" He said, "It is better for us." And if they slew it, then they slew the people of Allah, and they slew him, and they slew him.
Surely, those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Christians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good deeds, shall have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
And remember We took your covenant and We raised the Mount above you, saying: "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and remember what is therein, that you may fear."
Then you turned away after you turned away from Allah and His mercy and mercy, and you would certainly have been among the losers.
And certainly you knew those among you who transgressed in the Sabbath, and We said to them, "Be apes, despised."
So We made it as a lesson for those who have passed away, and a lesson for those who have a lesson and a admonition for those who guard.
And when Moses said to his people, "God commands you to slaughter a cow." They said, "Why did you ridicule us?" He said, "I seek refuge in God."
They said, "Call upon our Lord for us to make it clear to us." He said, "It is not a cow." He said, "It is not a cow, nor offspring." So what you do, then you are commanded.
They said, "Pray to your Lord to show us what He has set down." He said, "It is a cow that is yellow." He said, "It is a cow which is yellow."
They said, "Pray to your Lord for us to make clear to us what it is, and it is alike to us. If we wish, we will surely be guided."
He said: "It is he who is a cow, nor a cow." They said, "We have no food." They said, "We have come to you." They said, "We have come to you." They did not kill him, and they did not.
And when you killed a man, and disputed about it, and Allah is clear to what you hide.
So We said: Strike the cow, then Allah gives life to the dead, and He shows you His signs, so that you may understand.
Then after that, your hearts are hardened, even if they are like them, even if they are out of rocks, and rocks from which rivers flow; and some of them are split out of water; and there is some of them who fear Allah, and Allah is not heedless of what ye do.
Do you think that you should believe in the religion of Allah, when a party of them hear the word of Allah, and then after that they had heard it, after they had been taught?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when they are alone with each other, they say, "Do you tell them what God has revealed to you?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they hide and what they reveal?
And among them are some of them who know not the Book of the Book, and they only follow nothing but conjecture.
So woe to those who have been given the Book to the Book, and they say, "This is from Allah," so that they may sell it for a price for a paltry price. Woe to them for what they have earned, and woe to them for what they used to earn.
And they say: "The Fire will not touch us but for a few days." Say: "Have you taken a promise from Allah?" Say, "Have you taken a promise from Allah, or do you speak to Allah?"
Nay, but for those who commit evil and evil deeds, these are the dwellers of the fire; they shall abide therein.
But those who believe and do righteous deeds, these are the dwellers of Paradise, therein they shall abide.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): "Worship none but Allah, and to the parents, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and the orphans, and the needy, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and pay the prayer.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you (saying): "Do not shed your blood, nor shed your homes from your people, and then you bore witness that you are witnesses."
So you shall be among those who kill his people, and will make a party of his people, and some of them, and some of them, and some of them. And if they bring it to them, they will not remove it. And if they bring it to them, they will not be able to remove it. And the punishment of the Day of Resurrection is only in the life of this world. And Allah is not aware of what you do.
These are those who buy the life of this world for the price of the life of this world, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.
And We gave Moses the Book, and after him We sent messengers after him, and We gave Jesus the son of Mary with clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. And when there came to you a Messenger with whom you desire to be arrogant, he slew you with a false curse. And some of you were liars.
And they say, "Our hearts are hardened." Nay, God has cursed them for their disbelief, so that they may believe.
And when the Book has come to them from Allah, confirming what is with them, and those before them, before the disbelievers, when it came to them, they reject what they had received, but that they reject what they recognize.
Evil is that which Allah has sent down that they should not believe in that which Allah has sent down to His servants, that Allah may bestow down upon His servants whomever He pleases, and has wrath upon them. And for the unbelievers there is a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us." But if it is truth, it is truth confirming what is with them. Say, "What is the matter of Allah's Messenger?" Say, "What is the matter of the prophets?"
Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, and you took a calf after Him, and you were unjust.
And when We took a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hear." And they said, "We hear, we hear, and we did not believe in their hearts." Say, "What is the matter for you that you have faith?" Say, "This is what you believe."
Say: "If the abode of the Hereafter is for Allah, then for the exclusion of other people, then if you are truthful, then you should surely die."
And they will not wish to die, but they will not wish for it, but Allah knows the wrongdoers.
And you will surely be more than the people who are enemies of the people and the polytheists, and every thousand of them will be a thousand years of a thousand years. And if any of them is not able to die, it will not be averted from him. God sees what they do.
Say, “Whoever is an enemy to his enemy, it is to Allah that He has sent down to your heart the truth, confirming what is before it, and guidance and glad tidings to the believers.”
Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His messengers, His messengers, and His messengers, then Allah is the enemy of the disbelievers.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) clear signs, and none will deny them except the transgressors.
But when they swear to it, a party of them will come to them, but most of them do not believe.
And when a Messenger has come to them from Allah confirming what is with them, a party of those who were given the Book behind the Book of Allah behind their backs, even though they do not know.
And they followed the footsteps of those who were false in the footsteps of the devil, and they were not deceived by the devil, and the angels were made to be the people of the people, and the angels were given to them. And when they were in the hands of the two angels, they would not have been sent down to them. And when they were given to others, they would not be able to take a burden against them. And if they were told, they would not be able to escape.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, they would have been better for the better.
O you who believe! Do not say, "Unzurna," and say, "Unzurna", and listen to a painful punishment. And for the disbelievers there is a painful punishment.
The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) are not among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians), nor the polytheists (polytheists, polytheists, polytheists, polytheists, etc.) of your Lord (i.e. the Jews), to be sent down to your Lord (i.e. Allah), and Allah chooses to bestow His mercy on whom He pleases. And Allah chooses to show mercy to whomever He pleases.
"And who does not abrogate or cause to be forgotten, or We bring it to a better or a better one? Knowest thou not that Allah hath power over all things?"
Do you not know that Allah is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and He has no protector or helper?
Ask you to ask the Messenger of Allah, if Moses asked him, and he who disbelieves in unbelief has gone astray, and he has strayed in the way of the Way.
Many of the People of the Book would wish that you would turn away from you after you have believed from your faith, so that they may turn away from the truth after the truth has come to you. And pardon and forgive Allah. Allah has power over all things.
And pay the prayer and pay the Zakat and pay the good deeds before you, and whatever good you send before before you, you shall find God with you. God sees all that you do.
And they say: "None will enter Paradise unless they enter the Garden or the Christian." Say: "If you are truthful, then you are truthful."
But whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is a doer of good, he will have his reward with his Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians are not the Christians, and the Christians say, 'The Jews are not among the Jews." They say, "These are what they say." They say, "This is what they say." They will judge between the Day of Resurrection concerning what they differ.
And who is more unjust than he who forbids the mosques of Allah's mosques, and strives for their homes, and strives for their ruin? But there is not for those who fear them in fear of fear. For them is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter there is a great punishment.
And to Allah belongs the East and the West. And if you turn away, then Allah is the All-Sufficient, the All-knowing.
And they say: "Allah has begotten a son. Glory be to Him! Glory be to Him in the heavens and in the earth. To Him belongs all things."
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decides, He says, “Be!” and it is.
And those who do not know say, "Why does God not speak to us or to bring us a sign?" They said, "Their hearts are like their hearts." They are like a sign for those who believe. We have indeed made clear signs for those who believe.
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) with truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be asked about the dwellers of the Blazing Fire.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor will you follow them until you follow their religion. Say: "The guidance of Allah is on the right path." But if they follow their desires, then if you follow their desires, then you have no protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book read it as if it were to be read to it; they believe in it; and whoever disbelieves in it, it is they who are the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and I made you excel the nations.
And guard yourselves against a Day when no soul will avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And when Ibrahim had tried his Lord in the test, he fulfilled them, and He said, “I am going to make you a leader for mankind.” He said, “My son will be my son.” He said, “This is My promise.”
And when We appointed the House for mankind, and a sanctuary and a sanctuary for the House, [saying]: "Worship Abraham and Ishmael and Ishmael and Ishmael, and those who are obedient to God." And those who bow down and prostrate themselves and prostrate themselves and prostrate themselves and prostrate themselves.
And when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this a secure land and provide its people with fruits, and believe in God and the Last Day." He said, "I will give him a share for a little while I will. I will give him a share for the punishment of the Fire." How evil is the destination.
And when Ibrahim and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House, saying: Our Lord! accept from us, surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing.
Our Lord, make us submissive to Him, and make our offspring a nation submissive to us, and forgive us, and forgive us, for Thou art the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
Our Lord, send amongst them a Messenger from among themselves, who will recite to them Your Signs and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And who is more astray than he who turns away from the religion of Abraham, except for the sake of this world, and in the life of this world? Indeed, We have indeed in this world, and in the Hereafter he is among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, “Submit,” he said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds.”
And Abraham enjoined his sons and Jacob, saying, "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you the religion of Islam. You have no faith except as Muslims."
Have you considered the death when death died, when he said to his sons, "Will you worship me after me?" They said, "We shall worship you, and your fathers, and God's seed, and Ishmael and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Isaac, and to Him we are Muslims."
This was a nation that passed away; for it is what you have earned, and what you have earned, and you will not be questioned.
And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then you will be rightly guided. Say: "We follow the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say: "We believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to us, and that which was sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Ishmael and the tribes, and the prophets and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims."
But if they believe in you as believers, they are guided; but if they turn away, they are in dissension; and Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And who is better than Allah, and who is better than Allah? And we worship Him, and we worship Him.
Say: "Do you dispute with us about Allah, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord?
Or do you say: "Abraham (Ishmael), Ishmael (Ishmael), Ishmael (Ishmael), and Ya'qub (Ishmael), and Ya'qub (Jacob), and the Christians, or Christians, or Christians, or Christians? Say: "Are you better or better than Allah?" And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
These are a people who have passed away; it is for what they have earned; and for you is what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they did.
The people of the people will say: "What has the right to prevent them from their guidance?" Say, "To Allah belongs the East and the west. He guides whomever He wills and guides whomever He wills."
Thus We have made you a righteous community, that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger as a witness against you, and the Messenger We have made a witness to you, except that they may turn away from it. And whoever turns away from Allah, then He will be the followers of those who believe. And Allah is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
We see you in the heaven, and We will turn you to a qiblah whom We will. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are wherever you are wherever you are, and wherever you are wherever you are, they will know that it is the truth from their Lord. God is not aware of what they do.
And if you were to bring them all to the Book, they would not follow your Qibla, nor will you follow your religion, nor will they make any of them to follow their religion; and if you have knowledge after this, then you follow their desires.
Those to whom We have given the Book recognise it, but they recognise their sons, and some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.
And every direction has come to you, so that you may return to the good deeds; and if you bring it to Allah, then it is Allah Who has power over all things. Allah has power over all things.
And wherever you turn away from the Sacred Mosque, then turn away from the Sacred Mosque, and it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn away from the Sacred Mosque, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And if you do not fear them, then you have no authority against them. Do not fear them, but do not fear them, and do not fear them.
We have sent to you a Messenger from among you, who recites to you Our revelations and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek help in patience and prayer, for Allah is with those who patiently persevere.
"And do not say of those who are killed in Allah's cause as dead, nay, they are alive, nay, but you are not aware of it.
And We shall certainly test you with fear, hunger and hunger, and fruits and fruits, and give glad tidings to patience.
Who, when disaster strikes them, say, "We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return."
Those are those on whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord, and these are those who are guided.
Safa and Marwah are in the signs of Allah; and for the House, there is no blame in it, or for the pilgrimage that is in the House of Allah. And whoever does good, it is no blame for him; and Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Those who follow the truth and the guidance, We have revealed to them, and We have made it clear to them, and curse them against the truth.
But as for those who repent and amend, and make amends, I will return to them, and I am the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the curse of Allah and the angels and all mankind are cursed.
They shall abide therein, and they shall not be lightened, nor shall they be reprieved.
And your God is One God, there is no god but He, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth and the day and the day and the day and the day, and the mountains and the earth, and the rain, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, in the midst of the earth. And in the sky, there are signs in the sky.
And some of mankind are those who worship others as Allah as they love themselves, and those who believe in Allah are mightier than those who believe in Allah and those who do wrong, but that they may see when they see the punishment of Allah, and Allah is severe in punishment.
And when those who followed those who followed themselves, they shall see the punishment and their feet, and they shall be cut off.
And those who were left will say: "If only we had returned to us, we would disown us." But so Allah will show them their deeds, and they will not be able to escape the fire.
O mankind, eat of what is lawful in the earth and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Surely he is a enemy to you.
He only enjoins you to commit evil and indecency, and that you say that you know what you know.
And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down,” they say, “If we found our fathers, we will follow what we found our forefathers, nor did they guide the right path.”
And the example of those who disbelieve is like the likeness of those who shouts to nothing except to hear and hear ears, dumb ears, dumb, dumb, and dumb.
O you who believe! eat of the good things which We have provided for you and give thanks to Allah, if it is Him that you worship.
He has forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and blood, and swine, except by other than Allah. But if any of you does not hunger, nor transgressing any limits, it is no sin for him. God is Forgiving, Merciful.
The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) who conceal what is revealed to them and that which is in the Book of Allah, they eat not, and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them on the Day of Resurrection. Theirs is a painful punishment.
Those are they who buy error from error, and for forgiveness for forgiveness. So they will be the fire of Hell.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an), and the Book (the Qur'an), and those who differ in the Book (i.e. the Qur'an).
It is not good for you to be in the east and to the west, but whoever believes in Allah and the angels and the angels and the angels, and the angels and the prophets and the prophets, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and those who are patient, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and those who are patient, and those who are patient, they are the ones who are truthful. And those who are patient, they are the ones who are truthful.
O you who believe! The battle is against you against you, and a woman who has given birth to her wife, and she is a wife of a woman who is pregnant, and he is given the wife of his brother, and that he may make it lawful for his brother. This is a mercy from your brother. This is a mercy from your Lord, and a painful punishment.
And there is life for you in the life of retaliation, that ye may be godfearing.
And when death approaches you, he will leave it, and leave for parents relatives and near relatives. This is the duty of the righteous.
But if anyone compels him after he has heard it, it is no sin except for him; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
But if any one is guilty of a testator's testator, or in a testator's cause, there is no sin on him, but Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
“O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may become pious.”
A number of days is a number of days; and if you are sick, there will be a day on the Day of Resurrection; and those who do not wish, there is a feeding of the feeding of the feeding; and whoever does good, it is better for him; and if you know, it is better for you.
The Qur'an is in the Qur’an: “It is better for you that He may guide the people, and the guidance which is in the Qur’an, and it is in the Qur’an that which is revealed to mankind, and that there is a sign for those who have passed away from it, and that he may be one of those who have passed away, except that the Day of Resurrection will be left on the Day of Resurrection, and that which He has guided, then he will be left on the Day of Resurrection.
And when My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close to Me: I call on the call of the supplicant when he calls to Me: so let them respond to Me, and believe in Me, that they may be guided.
It is lawful for you to go to the day of the night, and it is that you are a garment for yourselves, and that you are a garment for yourselves, and that you may be a garment for yourselves, and that you may have your sins, so that you may be averse to Allah, and He will forgive you, and He will forgive you, and you will not be able to kill them, but Allah has made clear to you His command. Thus do Allah make clear to His people. Thus do Allah make clear to His people, and do not turn away from them. Thus Allah makes clear His revelations to mankind.
And do not consume your wealth in wealth, and do not make it lawful for you, but eat of the people of the people, and eat of the people that you know.

Surely you are among those who have knowledge about what you have knowledge. Do you argue about what you have no knowledge? God knows what you do.
Abraham was not a Jew or a Christian; but he was a Muslim, a upright man, and he was not of the polytheists.
The people of Abraham are those who follow him, who followed him and his Messenger, and Allah is the Protector of the believers.
A party of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they will not lead themselves astray, and they are not aware of it.
O People of the Book, why do you not believe in Allah's revelations, and that you bear witness?
O People of the Book! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?
And some of the People of the Book say: "Believe in what has been sent down to the believers in the morning, and disbelieve in it, so that they may turn away."
And do not believe except one who follows you, and say: "This is the guidance of Allah," and they say: "If you believe, you will be like those who have been given to you." Say, "If you believe in your Lord, He will give it to whomever He wills. And Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
He grants mercy to whom He pleases, and Allah is the possessor of bounty.
Among the People of the Book, if any of them is possessed of wealth, he will bring it to you; and among them is some of them if thou wilt find him, if thou wilt be with them, if thou wilt not leave him, unless he should be a enemy to us. That is because they say, "We have no authority against us." And they say, "We are not to be called."
But whoever fulfills his pledge and fears Allah, then surely Allah loves those who are pious.
Those who sell their covenant with Allah and their oaths, there is no portion in the Hereafter and on the Day of Resurrection, nor will Allah look on them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them. Theirs is a painful punishment.
Among them there are some of them who distort the Scripture with their tongues, so that you may think that it is not from the Book. And they say, "This is from God." They say, "This is from God, and it is not from God."
It is not for any human being that Allah has sent down to him the Book and wisdom and prophethood, and he says: "My Lord!" He said: "Be devoted to the truth of the Book and the Book."
And the angels and the prophets will not obey you. And if you have surrendered to Islam, then will he judge you to disbelieve?
And remember when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets, saying, "I gave you the Book and wisdom, and then come to you a Messenger confirming what is with you, and you will help him and help him."
But if he turns away from him, it is the transgressors.
Are they seeking other than God's religion? To Him who is in the heavens and the earth, willingly willingly and unwillingly, and to Him they shall return.
Say: "We believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to us, and to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Jacob, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the messengers, and the messengers, and we are to submit to God."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How will God guide a people who disbelieved after his belief, and bore witness that the Messenger is true, and have come to them with clear proofs? God does not guide the unjust people.
That is the recompense of those who are on the curse of Allah, the angels, the angels, and all mankind.
They shall abide therein; they shall not be lightened, nor shall they be reprieved.
But if anyone compels them and do righteous deeds, surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
But if those who disbelieved after their faith and then disbelieved in their disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted, and they are indeed astray.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the earth will not be accepted from it, and it will not be accepted for him. They shall have a painful punishment, and they shall have no helpers.
By no means will you attain righteousness unless you give out of what you love, and whatever you spend, surely Allah is aware of what you do.
Eat the food of the Children of Israel. The Children of Israel had been forbidden to the Law of the Torah. Say, "Bring the Torah, if you are truthful."
But if any of Allah is a liar, then they are the wrongdoers.
Say: "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham, the religion of Abraham.
Verily, the first House appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah, at Bakkah, and a guidance and a guidance for the worlds.
There are signs in the signs of Abraham; and whoever enters it, it is security and security; and the Pilgrimage of Allah is the pilgrimage of the House; and whoever disbelieves in it, then Allah is Self-sufficient, All-sufficient.
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in Allah's revelations, and Allah is Witness of what you do?"
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you seek to seek the way of Allah to prevent those who believe and seek for it? And Allah is not unaware of what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey those of the People of the Book, if you have faith, then they will turn you back to disbelief.
How can you disbelieve in that which Allah has rehearsed to you, and His Messenger is in you, and whoever takes a oath to Allah, that He will guide you to a straight path?
“O you who believe! be careful of Allah's duty to Him, and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast to Allah's sake, and do not be divided, and remember the favor of Allah's favor, and remember your hearts. He has made your hearts into your hearts, and you were saved by the brink of the fire. And He saved you from the brink of the fire, and you were saved from the fire. Thus Allah makes clear to you His signs.
And there is a party among you who invites to good good deeds, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is right, and these are the successful.
And do not be like those who are divided into groups and fall into disputations after receiving clear proofs. And they have a great punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces are blackened, and whose faces will be blackened, "Did you reject faith after accepting you? Then taste what you disbelieved."
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah; they will abide therein forever.
These are the revelations of Allah, which We recite to thee, and Allah does not desire any injustice to the creatures.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Him is all that to return.
“You are the best of mankind, the best of mankind, and enjoin what is right; and if you believe in Allah, and believe in Allah, and believe in Allah, He would have made them better, and most of them are transgressors.”
They will not harm you unless you harm them, and if they fight you, they will turn their backs on you, and they will not be helped.
They will not be afflicted by God's people, except for the people, and the people, and they are on the side of God's wrath, and they have taken the wrath of God upon them, and they kill the false prophets. That is because they rejected the signs of God and slay the prophets.
They are not all alike, among the People of the Book; there is a party of the People of the Book who recite the signs of Allah, prostrating the night and prostrating prayer.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and forbid those who do good deeds, and they are among the righteous.
And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it; and Allah knows best those who do good.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their properties nor their children will avail them against Allah. They are the dwellers of the fire, and they will abide therein.
The likeness of the life of this world is like the likeness of the earth, which is in the midst of the wind, which is in its midst, and destroys it, and destroys it; and Allah has not wronged them.
O you who believe! Do not take away any other than those who do not believe, but they will not harm you, but they love you. Their hatred is from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater than what their breasts conceal. And We have indeed made clear to you the signs.
You are the ones who love you, and you do not love you. And when they meet you, they say, "We believe," and when they meet you, they say, "We believe in your rage." Say, "Die." Say, "Die." Say, "Die!"
If good befalls you, it grieves them; but if ill befalls you, they rejoice in it, and if you are patient, their guile will not harm you. God encompasses what they do.
And remember when you entered your family in the morning, for the believers in their stations, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
And when two parties parties against you, they wanted to be Allah, and Allah is the Protector of those who believe.
And Allah had helped you at Badr when you were weak, and fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
And when you said to the believers, "Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels?"
But if you are patient, and if you are patient, then you will attack your Lord with five thousand angels.
And Allah did not save it except as a good news, and that your hearts may rest thereby; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
That he might cut off the unbelievers or cut off them, and they turn away from them.
It is not for you whether He may punish them or punish them or punish them. Such is the wrong-doers.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! Do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah, that you may prosper.
And fear the Fire which is prepared for those who disbelieved.
And obey Allah and the Messenger, that you may receive mercy.
And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous.
Those who spend in prosperity and in adversity, and who restrain anger, and pardon men, and Allah loves the righteous.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives sins except Allah?
For them is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. How excellent is the reward for those who work!
Many have passed away before you, so travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a clear statement for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for the pious.
And do not grieve, nor grieve, but if you are believers, you will be superior to the upper hand.
And if a wound has touched you, a wound similar to the unbelievers, and it is We who have made the people go back to men, and that Allah may know that He may know those who believe and be witnesses of others. God does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test the believers and destroy the disbelievers.
Do you think that you will enter Paradise, while Allah has not tested you, and who are patient and patient?
And you have already met for death before you have met, and you have seen it.
Muhammad is not a Messenger, but many Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? And if he turns back to his heels, he will not harm him. God will reward the grateful.
And there is no death except by Allah's leave, except for a appointed term; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We give it to him, and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We shall give it to him, and We shall give thanks to the grateful.
And how many a Prophet has fought against Allah, and they had taken their covenant in Allah's way, and did not weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, and Allah loves the patient.
And they said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses, and make us victory over the unbelievers, and give us victory over the disbelieving people."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter, and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will be losers.
But Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they associate others with Allah, for which He has sent down no authority. Their abode is Hell, and evil is the destination.
And Allah has promised the promise of your promise, so when they break them, then you slew him by his command, and after that you were arguing in the matter, and after that you had been given what you had been given, and after that you had been given to the truth, then He saved you from the life of the Hereafter, and He gave you the life of the life of the Hereafter. He has pardoned you, and Allah is the Most Merciful of the believers.
When you were afflicted, and there was no one to come to you, and the Messenger called you back to you, so that He might afflict you for what you have earned, and that you might not grieve for what you have earned, and Allah is aware of what you do.
Then He took a veil upon you, then He sent a veil against you, and a party of them said, “How have a group of a group of which they had no power?” They said, “What is what we have done for us?” They said, “This is what we have done.” Say, “What is what we have done for us?” Say, “What is what we have done for us.” Say, “What is what we have been doing to God.” Say, “This is what we have been doing.” Say, “What is this for us?” Say, “This is what is what is in your homes.” And Allah knows what you do.
Those of you who turned away from the day when the two armies met, Satan made some of them for some of you, but Allah forgave them, and Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when they travel in the land, and when they go out or fight, they say, "If we had stayed with us, they would not have died." God will give it to them, and He will die and die. God is Seer of what you do.
And if you are killed or die in the cause of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are better than what they amass.
And if you die or die, then to Allah you shall be gathered.
So it is from the mercy of Allah that you deal with them, and if you were harsh, you would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and ask forgiveness for them. So when you have decided, then put your trust in Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, there is none who can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, then will He help you if He helps you?
And there is no blame in the Prophet, nor will he grieve in what he has done, and every soul will be paid on the Day of Resurrection; every soul will be paid full of what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of God like he who has touched the wrath of God, and whose abode is Hell? How evil is the destination!
They are in varying ranks, and God sees what they do.
God has conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, rehearsing to them His Signs, and purifying them, and instructing them in the Book and wisdom, while before that they were in manifest error.
And when a affliction befell you, when it was a matter you were afflicted, and said, "Is it what is with you?" Say, "This is from yourselves. God has power over all things."
And what befell you on the day when the two armies met the battle of Allah, and that He might know the believers, and that He might know the believers.
And the hypocrites and the hypocrites said: "Come to fight in the way of Allah." They said, "If we were fighting, we would certainly have been given to us." They said, "If we were fighting, we would certainly have been given to you." They say, "We have been closer to you. God knows what is in their hearts and what they hide."
Those who said to their brothers, "If they had been killed, they would not have killed us." Say, "If you are truthful, then die from death."
"And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead as dead; nay, they are alive for their Lord and sustenance for their sustenance."
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed on them, and those who are behind them, for those who are behind them, and those who are behind them will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in Allah's grace and bounty, and Allah does not reward the believers.
As for those who responded to Allah and His Messenger, and those of them who have done good deeds, there is a great reward for them.
Those to whom the people said: "The people have gathered against you, so fear them," but it only increased their faith, and they said: "Sufficient for us is Allah, and He is the Best of affairs."
So they returned to Allah's grace and bounty, and they followed the pleasure of Allah, and they followed the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
It is only Satan who frightens his friends, so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And let not those grieve those who disbelieve until they do not harm Allah; they will not harm Allah in the life of this world; Allah will not give them any portion in this world, and they will have a grievous chastisement.
Those who purchase disbelief in the cause of Allah, they will not harm Allah at least, and for them is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that We give them respite for them; so We grant them respite that they may increase in their sins, and they shall have a humiliating punishment.
It is not Allah's leave, that you may be in the right hand, until the evil of the evil-doers will be changed to you, and Allah chooses to know what He pleases, and Allah chooses His messengers whom He pleases. So believe in Allah and His Messengers, and if you believe, you shall have a great reward.
And do not think that which Allah has bestowed down for them from His grace, it is better for them that it may be better for them; nay, it is better for them that they shall be niggardly on the Day of Resurrection, and that they shall be niggardly on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
Verily, Allah has said to those who say: "Allah is the Most High, and we are rich." We said, "We have sent down what they have spoken to them." We will say, "Taste the punishment of the Fire."
“This is because of what your hands have sent before, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.”
Those who say, "We have taken that Allah has promised us a Messenger." Say, "Messengers have come to us before me." Say, "There came to me Messengers before you and with what you said, if you are truthful, then you kill them.
But if they deny you, then were Messengers before you, who came with clear proofs, with clear proofs, and the Book, and the Book.
Every soul will taste it, and you will not be paid on the Day of Resurrection. The fire will be admitted to the fire, and the earth will be admitted to the garden, and the life of the world is nothing but a temporary life.
You shall surely be tested by your wealth and your lives, and you shall hear from those who were given the Book before you and from those who were given the Book before you. But if you persevere and guard from Allah, then surely, it is that which is in the Book.
And remember when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book (i.e. the Qur'an) from the People of the Book (i.e. the Qur'an), and He revealed it to mankind (i.e. the Qur'an), and it was not clear to them, but they threw it back behind it, and sold it for a paltry price. Evil is what they used to hide.
Do not think that those who rejoice in their souls rejoice in it, and that they may be praised for what they have not earned, and do not think that they are a painful punishment.
And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over all things.
Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and the day, are signs for those who are mindful.
Those who remember Allah, standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, saying, "Our Lord, You have not created this for nothing.
Our Lord, You admit to the Fire, You have disgraced him, and there is no helper for the wrongdoers.
Our Lord, we have heard the call of a calling of faith, saying, "Believe in your Lord, and we have believed. Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our evil deeds, and we shall be among the righteous."
Our Lord, grant us what You have promised us, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection, for You never break your promise.
So their Lord answered for them, and I will not be among you, nor will you eat of yourselves, or for some of you. But if they leave homes and homes, and leave the homes of the homes, and will fight in the cause of Allah, and will make a double place for you in the garden. This is the reward from Allah, which is in which rivers flow, and Allah is with the best.
Do not let the unbelievers deceive you in the land.
This is a enjoyment for them, and their abode is Hell; and evil is the destination.
But as for those who fear their Lord, there are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide for ever; and Allah is with those who do good, and that is the best of the righteous.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to you and what has been sent down to them, and that they may not sell Allah's revelations. They are those who have their reward with their Lord. Lo! Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! persevere in patience and constancy, and remain steadfast and fear Allah, that you may prosper.
O mankind! Fear your Lord Who created you from a single soul, and created him from a single pair, and created many men and women and women, and fear Allah, and do not fear your relations. Surely Allah is Witness over you.
And give the wealth of their wealth, and do not harm it, and do not eat their wealth for their wealth. Indeed, he is a great sin.
And if you fear that you will not marry the orphans, then you will marry two women, or two, or four, or four, but if you fear that you will not be able to do justice. It is not for you that you should not be able to do justice.
And give the women their dowries. If they give it to you, then consume it with it, and give it to you with a wholesome appetite.
And do not give the wealth of wealth that God has made for you, and provide for them out of it, and clothe them thereby, and speak to them good words.
And marry the orphans until they have attained to their wives. If you are in them, then give them their wealth, and do not consume the wealth of the poor. And if any of you is needy, let it be for them. And if any of you is needy, let it be for them. And if any of you is needy, let him be niggardly. And if any of them is needy, then bear witness to them. God is Sufficient and sufficient.
There is a share for men and relatives, and the relatives and women and women and women, or a share for the relatives, or a share.
And when the relatives and the orphans and the needy are given to them, give them good things and speak words to them.
And let those who fear that they should leave behind offspring behind them, they would be afraid of their fear; so let them be afraid of Allah, and speak words.
Those who eat the wealth of the orphans eat their bellies in their bellies, and they will burn in the fire.
God has given you your sons, and two women have two wives, and the two women are better than two. And if any of them is two than the two females, they are more than two women. And if it is alone, it is, then, that it may be for them. And if it is alone, it will be for him. And if it is alone, then it is, then, for the sake of God. And if it is possible for him, then it is for him. And if he is alone, he will take it for him. And if he is a child, then it is for him. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And to those who have divorced your wives, then if any of you had a son or a son, then if he had a son, then if he had taken a son, then if you have a child, then if you have a child, then if you have a child, then if you have a child, then if you have a child, then if you have a child, then if you have a child, then if you have a child, then if you have a child, then if you have a child or a child. And if you have a child, then it will be a share for them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Forbearing.
These are the limits of Allah, and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever; and that is the supreme triumph.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will admit him to abide therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment.
And if any of you is guilty of lewdness, then take four witnesses against them, then if they testify, confine them to houses until death should die until death or Allah will guide them.
And if one of you is guilty of indecency, slay them, then if they repent and amend, turn away from them; surely Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.
Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and in ignorance; then repent will turn to them; for Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.
The repentance of repentance is not for those who do evil, until death comes to one of them, and he says, “Indeed, I repent,” and he disbelieves in rejecting the disbelievers. We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit the women, nor to make it clear to you, except that you have given them a part of what you have given them. So if you dislike them, let them not be niggardly. And if you dislike them, it will be better for you. God is good for you.
And if you wish to take a wife for a wife, and you have given them a double amount of wealth, then do not turn away from it, and do not turn away from it.
And how can you have any other knowledge of what you have made, and you have made a covenant with them?
And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed past before them; it is an evil and evil way.
It is you who have given your wives, and your daughters, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, and women, that ye shall not be forgiven.
And marry women, except that they are your own hands, and it is that which Allah has ordained for you, and that ye do not commit adultery, except for the sake of which ye have acquired. And if ye commit not to commit adultery, ye shall not commit adultery for what ye have given them. And if ye marry, ye shall find no blame for them; surely Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And if any of you is not able to marry the believing women, the men and the needy among you who are among you are not niggardly; and Allah knows best those who are believers, and He knows those who do not believe. And if they give them permission, then they shall be like those who have no faith. And if they give them permission, they are guilty of what they fear; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
God desires to make clear to you, and to guide you to the ways of those before you, and He will forgive you, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.
And Allah wants to turn to you, but those who follow their lusts wish to drive you away from the far path.
God wants to lighten your burden, and man is created weak.
O you who believe! Do not consume yourselves in the property of yourselves, but do not kill yourselves, but do not kill yourselves; surely Allah is the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
And if any of him shall go in a transgression and transgression, We shall cast him into fire, and that is easy for God.
If you avoid the sins of sins, We will remove you from your sins and admit you to a noble place.
Do not covet what Allah has given you excel from others, and for men there is a share for what they have earned, and the women have earned what they have earned; and Allah is the Knower of all things.
And We are heirs for heirs of the parents and the relatives, and those who have made your covenant with you. And give them their share with them. God is Witness over all things.
The women have taken for women that Allah has made some of them better than others, and that they spend their wealth, and the women who spend their wealth in their wealth, and the women who do not know their wealth, and the women who are near to their homes, and the women who do not know that Allah is the Most High, the Most High.
And if you fear a breach between them, appoint a arbiter between his family and from his family, if they wish for peace, if they wish for peace, Allah will judge between them; surely Allah is Knowing, Aware.
And worship Allah, and do not associate anything with Him, and to the parents, and to the orphans, and the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer. God loves not the arrogant.
“Those who are niggardly, and enjoin men, and enjoin what Allah has given them of His grace, and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.”
And those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah, and they believe in Allah and the Last Day, and those who believe in him, is an evil companion.
And if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spend what has been given them, and Allah knows what they have spent.
Allah does not wrong the weight of a atom's weight, and if He does good, He will double it, and He will have a great reward.
How will it be, when We bring forth from every nation a witness, and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against them?
On that day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were buried in the earth.
O you who believe! Do not approach until you do not pray until you know what you say, and you will not be able to make a single one of you, and you will not find a single one of you, unless you are patient or not, or you will not find a part of the water or your hands; and if you are patient or not, then you are the <unk>, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, and they wish to turn away from it?
And Allah knows your enemies, and Allah is Sufficient for Him, and Allah is Sufficient for Him.
The Jews were left in their homes, and they said, “<unk>,” and they said, “We’re going to talk.” And when he stretches out his hands, they said, “We have to be better.” They said, “We are better than those who do not believe.” But if they say, “We are better than them.” But if they had been cursed, they will not believe.
O People of the Book! We have sent down to you what is with you, confirming what is with them, and We turn away their backs, or curse them, or We cursed those whom We cursed against the Children of Israel. And what is the command of Allah that is what it is.
“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be associated with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases to whomsoever He pleases.
Have you not seen those who claim to say to themselves, "Nay, but Allah wills whom He wills, and they will not be wronged."
See how they invent a lie against Allah, and that is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture, and those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve, saying, “These are the believers who are better than the believers?”
Those are those whom Allah has cursed, and He whom Allah curses, you will not find for him a helper.
Is there any of them who is the kingdom of the Kingdom, and that they will not find a good thing?
Or do they envy the people because of what Allah has given them of His bounty? And We gave to Ibrahim the Book and wisdom, and We have given them a great kingdom.
But among them are some of them who believe in the Book, and some of them turn away from them; for them is a burning fire.

Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what has been sent down to you, and that they wish to make judgement to those who have been ordered to reject the truth? And Satan will make clear to them a clear error.

How could it be that when affliction befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, and they come to you swearing swearing, swearing by Allah, saying, "We wish nothing but conciliation and conciliation?"
Those are they who know what is in their hearts, so turn away from them, and admonish them, and speak to them.
We did not send any Messenger except that he should be obeyed by Allah's permission, and when they had wronged themselves, then they would have come to you, and Allah would forgive them for forgiveness, and He would forgive them for Allah’s mercy, and He would have mercy on them.
“But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”

Have you not seen those who were told to say, "Restrain your hands and keep prayer and pay prayer," when it was prescribed for them, when a group of them were afraid of the fear of God, and they were afraid of the fear of God? And when they were afraid of their fear, they said, "Our Lord, grant us the enjoyment of this world." Say, "Our Lord is more-sufficient."

When there comes to them a fear of security or fear, it is they who have made it clear to them, and if it had been given to them, and those among them who have been given the Messenger, they would know that it would be known for them.

Had Allah willed, they would have fought against you. But if they turn away from you, they would not have fought against you. And Allah has not made them a way for you.
They will find you secure from that which you wish to secure, and to secure from their people. But if they do not turn away from you, they will not enter it. But if they do not turn away from you, they will not leave you, and leave them wherever you kill them, and wherever you kill them, then We have given you clear authority.

As for those who believe, they are not equal to the cause of the believers, and those who strive with their wealth, and those who fight with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. And Allah has made the reward of those who strive hard in their homes, and Allah has made a good reward for those who strive, and Allah has made a great reward for them.

Those who do evil, when the angels say to them, "What did you say?" They said, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say, "Was not God's earth?" They will say, "Was not the land of God's earth?" They will be their abode, and their abode is Hell. How evil is the destination!

We have sent down the Torah, wherein is guidance and light; and the prophets and the prophets are commanded to be judged by the Book of Allah, and to the Jews and those who were given the Book. So do not fear the people of Allah, and fear Me, and fear not My revelations. And those who do not obey it, they are unbelievers.
And We decreed for them in that which is as a eye for a eye, a eye for a eye, a eye for a eye, a eye for a eye, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth; and whoever does not judge what Allah has sent down to him, it is for him that he may be the unjust.
And in their footsteps We sent Jesus Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which was before him, and We gave him the Gospel, wherein was guidance and light and confirmation of the Torah, confirming the Torah, and a guidance for the cautious.
And follow the followers of the Book which Allah has sent down to them, and they do not judge in what Allah has sent down. Those are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to thee (O Muhammad) the Book (the Qur'an) in truth, confirming the Book which was before them, and the witness of Allah is the witness of which He has sent down to you justice between the truth. So do not follow their desires (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, revelations, etc.) of Allah, and do not follow their desires (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, revelations, etc.), do not follow their desires (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, revelations, etc.) of Allah, and do not follow their desires (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, revelations, etc.).
And judge between them between what Allah has sent down, and follow not their desires. And beware of them, lest they tempt you from some of what Allah has sent down to you. But if they turn away, then know that Allah will punish them. And most of mankind are transgressors.
Or do they wish that they are better than Allah, and who is better than the people who are in a state of faith?
O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease, [saying], "We fear lest some misfortune should befall us." Then, if it came to pass, then Allah will bring some of them or bring it from Himself, and they will be forgiven to what they hide.
And those who believe will say: "Are these the ones who swore by Allah?" They said, "We are with you," but their deeds failed to perish.
O you who believe! If any of you should turn away from his religion, then Allah will bring a people who will love Him, and who will love Him, and who will fight in the cause of Allah, who will fight in the cause of Allah, and do not fear the blame of a critic. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knower.
Your ally is only Allah and His Messenger and those who believe, and pay the prayer and pay the zakat and bow down.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and those who believe, surely Allah is the victorious of the company.
“O you who believe! make not for those who have been given the Book before you and those who were before you, and do not make friends for those who have been given the Book and the unbelievers, so that you should be believers.
And when you call to prayer, they take it as a sport and sport. This is because they are people who do not understand.
Say, “O People of the Book, do you resent us except that we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down before us and that most of you are transgressors?”
Say, "Shall I inform you of something worse than God's punishment than this?" They will be those whom God has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those whom He has made, and those who worshipped Satan, and those who are astray, are far astray.
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe," but when they go with it, they are with you, and Allah knows best what they hide.
And you will see many of them who sin in sin and transgression, and eating what is unlawful. Evil is what they do.
Do they not forbid the rabbis and the rabbis and the unlawful women? Evil is what they do. Evil is what they do.
And the Jews say: "Allah's hands", and their hands hands their hands, and they were destroyed by their hands. It is not except that it is only in the hands of the flesh, but it is that which is in the hands of Allah, and that which He has sent down to them. And the Day of Resurrection, and that which is revealed to them, will surely be destroyed by the cause of Allah. And Allah loves those who do mischief. And Allah loves not the mischief.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would certainly have removed their sins and admitted them to Gardens of bliss.
And if they had observed the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have eaten from above their feet, and from beneath their feet. Among them there is a party of them. And most of them are evil.
O Messenger, deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message; and Allah will protect you from the people. God does not guide the unbelieving people.
Say: "O People of the Book! You have no power on you until you stand on the Law and the Gospel and the Gospel, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord. So do not let the unbelievers grieve.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good deeds, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We sent messengers to them. Whenever there came to them a Messenger, they desired to have their own souls, and some of them.
And they thought that there was no affliction, but they became blind, and yet Allah showed mercy to them; and many of them were blind and deaf. And Allah sees what they do.
Those who disbelieve say, "The Messiah, son of Mary, is God's son," and the Messiah said, "Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Whoever associates with Allah, Allah has forbidden Paradise for those who associate partners with Allah and his abode, and the Fire is the Fire.
Those who say: "There is no god but Allah, and there is no god except Him." But if they desist, it is not for those who say, "It is not but a painful punishment."
Will they not turn away from God, and ask for His forgiveness? God is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger; many Messengers have passed away before him; and his mother was a witness of the truth; and his mother was truthful. See how We make clear to them the signs, then see how they turn away.
Say: "Do you worship besides Allah that which has no power or benefit for you, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing?"
Say: "O People of the Book! Do not exceed the limits of the truth in your religion, nor follow the desires of the people who had gone astray before, and misled many of those who have gone astray before, and have gone astray from the right path."
Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they disobeyed and persisted.
They did not forbid each other of what they did, but evil is what they did.
You see many of them who disbelieve. Evil is that which has been sent down before them. Evil is that which Allah has sent down for them, and in the punishment they shall abide.
And if they had believed in Allah and the Messenger and what was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends; but most of them are transgressors.
You will certainly see the people of the Jews, the Jews, and the polytheists, and those who say, “We are Christians.” And if they say, “We are Christians.” And some of them are some of some of them and monks, and they are not arrogant.
And when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears in the truth, and they say, "Our Lord, we believe, so write us down among the witnesses."
“What is it that we should believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, and that our Lord will admit us to the company of the righteous people?”
But they said, "God has prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. That is the reward of the righteous."
But those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, etc.) are the dwellers of the fire?
O you who believe! Make not the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress limits; surely Allah loves not transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has provided for you, and eat of what Allah has provided you, and fear Allah.
God has sworn for you in order that you may not forget it, and that you may give it to you. And if they eat of the cattle, it will be lawful for you to eat, or to eat of the cattle. And if it comes to pass, it will be for you. And if it comes to pass, then the people of the Cave. Thus do Allah make clear to you what is in your hands. Thus do Allah make clear to you what you are thankful.
O you who believe! intoxicants and gambling, and the arrows of the devils and the arrows of Satan. Evil is Satan, so that you may prosper.
Satan wants to lead enmity between you and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and prayer and prayer. Will you not then desist?
Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and if you turn away, then know that our duty is only to convey the duty of Our Messenger.
There is no blame for those who believe and do good deeds, that they should be afraid of what they have eaten, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds; and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! Allah has given you some of that which is with your hands or your lances, and that He may know that Allah knows what he fears in secret. But whoever disbelieves after that, a painful punishment will have a painful punishment.
O you who believe! Do not spend in the land, and know what you know. And if any of you is a man who is a man who is a man who is a one of you who is in prison for a person who is near to a person who is near to a enemy, or a woman who commits a good deed, then that he may be a enemy for one who has passed away from him, or that he may have a good deed. And Allah is the Mighty, the Mighty.
It is lawful for you to eat of the sea, and for a provision, and for a provision for you, and for the pilgrimage, and for the pilgrimage, and the dwellings which you have forbidden is forbidden. And fear Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah for the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, and that you know that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and the earth, and Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message, and Allah knows what you disclose and what you reveal.
Say, “The evil and the bad are not like the bad. So if you fear Allah, you will be successful, so that you may be successful.”
O you who believe! Do not ask about what the truth has come to you, but if you ask what is clear to you, then ask what is revealed to you. And Allah will forgive you. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
A people before you asked questions, and they disbelieved.
Allah has not forbidden the Qur'an, or a Wasilah, or a Wasilah, or a Wasilah, and a lie against Allah; but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," they say, "Sufficient for us is what we found our fathers." But if their fathers did not know, they were not guided.
O you who believe! Be careful of your own souls. If you are guided, it will not harm you. To Allah is your return, to Him is your return, and He will inform you what you did.
O you who believe! When any of you is death, some of you are two parties, and some of you are in the land. If you wish to travel in the land, then it is, if you are in the land, and if you are in doubt of the land, then if you are in doubt, then if you are truthful, they will not be able to give it to God. If they are witnesses, then they will not be of those who are unjust.
But if he had known that two parties, they both are guilty of the two of those who are two, among those who are two, nearest to the two of them, and swear by God's testimony, and swear by the testimony of Allah, that we should be truer than our testimony, and we have not exceeded it, and we have not exceeded it.
That is nearer to them that they may bear witness or testimony after their oaths; and fear Allah, and listen to Him, and Allah does not guide the unjust people. God does not guide the disobedient people.
On the Day when Allah will gather them all together, He will say: "What is your response to you?" They said: "We have no knowledge of the unseen."
And when Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O my father, I will give you a blessing to his mother and to his mother, and I will give you security in the land and in the land." And when He gave you the Book and the Wisdom, then it is He who has created me from the dust of the earth. And when he brings it to me, the unbelievers say, "This is nothing but clear." And when it comes to you with a clear word, the unbelievers say, "This is nothing but obvious magic." And when the Children of Israel came to pass with it, then it is nothing but obvious magic.
And when I inspired the disciples, that I should believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: We believe, and bear witness that we are Muslims.
And when the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord sent down to us a table from heaven?" He said, "Fear God, if you are believers."
They said, “We desire to eat from it, and our hearts are our hearts, and we know that we are truthful, and that we may be witnesses.”
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven, to be a festival for us, and to us, and to us, and to us, for You are the Best of providers."
Allah said: "I will send it down to you, but if any one of you, I will punish him, and I will punish him with a severe punishment in the earth."
And when Allah said, "O Jesus son of Mary, did you say to mankind: 'This is my mother and my mother?' He will say, "Glory be to you, I am not truthful." But if he said, "I know what is right. I know what is in my heart. I know what is in your heart. You know what is in your heart. You know what is in your heart, and I do not know what is in your heart."
Never said to them aught except what Thou didst command me: "Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness over all things.
If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if Thou forgive them, Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say: This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth. They are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. God is with them, and with them. That is the supreme triumph.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and He has power over all things.
All praise belongs to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and the light and the light; then those who disbelieve are equal to their Lord.
“It is He who created you from a single soul, and then decreed a term (of a term), and a term (of a term) is a stated term.
And He is Allah in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you hide and what you earn.
No sign comes to them from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
But they denied the truth when it came to them, but there will come to them the news of what they mocked.
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, how We established in the earth, and We did not give you any power on the earth, and We gave them abundant rain, and made the rivers flow beneath them? Thus We destroyed their sins, and made a new covenant between them.
And if We sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) a book written on paper, and they touched it with their hands, those who disbelieve would have said: "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not a angel been sent down to him?" And if We sent down a angel, they would have been given it, and they would not be reprieved.
And if We had made him a angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We have made it as a matter to them.
Messengers before you were mocked, but the scoffers were surrounded by what they mocked.
Say: Travel in the earth and see what was the end of those who denied (the truth).
Say: "To whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To Allah belongs Allah's mercy. He has decreed for Himself the Day of Resurrection. He will surely gather you with the Day of Resurrection, who will not believe."
And to Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Say: "Shall I take a protector other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "I am commanded to be commanded," and He feeds it. Say: "I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit (to Allah)."
Say, “If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a great Day.”
On the Day when He will be averted from that day, Allah has mercy on him, and that is the manifest triumph.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, none can remove it except Him; and if He touches you with good fortune, He is Able to do all things.
And He is the Omnipotent over His servants, and He is the Wise, the Wise.
Say: "Is there any more than that in which you are in their own faith?" Say, "I have come to God, and have been revealed to me." And when it was revealed to you, you will say, "There is no god but Allah." Say, "There is no god except Him." Say, "There is no god except Him." Say, "There is no god except Him." Say, "There is no god except Him."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their sons, but those who have lost their souls will not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against God or denies His revelations? But the wrongdoers will not prosper.
And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated others with Allah, "Where are your partners?"
Then they will say, "By Allah, we have never been associated with Him, and we were not associated with Him."
See how they lie against them, and they have invented what they invented.
And among them are some who listen to you, and We have ears to understand their hearts, and deafness in their ears. But if they see all signs, they will not believe in it. But if they come to you, they will not believe in it. Those who disbelieve will say to you, "These are nothing but tales of the ancients."
And they forbid away from it, and they turn away from it, and they do not destroy it, and they do not know.
And if you could see when they are made to stand on the Fire, and they will say, "Would that we had been sent back, we would not deny the signs of our Lord, and would not deny the truth."
Nay, it has come to them that which they hide before them, and if they were returned to that which they were forbidden, they would surely turn away from it, and they are indeed liars.
And they say: There is nothing but the life of this world and we shall not be resurrected.
And if you could see when they are brought before their Lord, He will say: "Is it not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say, "Yes, the punishment of your Lord!" Then taste the punishment.
Those who deny the meeting of Allah, are indeed losers, and when the Hour comes to them, they say, "Woe to us! Woe to us that we neglected what we neglected, and their burdens burdens their burdens. How evil is their burdens!"
And the life of this world is nothing but amusement and amusement. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, then do you not understand?
We know that you will not grieve, but they will not deny you. The wrongdoers deny the signs of Allah.
Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient, and they were patient, and they were patient until Our help came to them. There is none who can alter the words of Allah.
And if their aversion is hard for you, then if you are in the earth or a ladder in the sky, then bring them a sign to them; and if Allah willed, He would have guided them. And if He had willed, they would not be among the ignorant.
Those who listen to Him will call to Him, and Allah will resurrect them on the Day of Resurrection.
And they say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "God is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
And there is no animal on the earth or its bird, nor are there any part of its wings, except though you are like yourselves. We have neglected nothing in the Book, and they will be gathered to their Lord.
And those who reject Our signs are deaf and dumb, and in the darkness of darkness; and whomsoever He wills, He turns astray to whom He pleases, and He guides whomever He wills to the right path.
Say: "Have you considered if the punishment of Allah comes to you or the Day of Resurrection, will you call upon other than Allah?
Nay, but He will call upon Him, but if He wills, He will remove that which you call upon Him, and He will forget what you associate with Him.
And We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW), but We seized them with distress and hardship, so that they might humble themselves.
But when Our punishment came to them, why did they not humble themselves, and their hearts were hardened, and Satan made evil for them?
But when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened them to the gates of the gate, and We seized them with what they had done, so We seized them with a while.
So the wrong-doers were cut off, and all praise belongs to God, and all praise is to the Lord of the worlds.
Say: "Have you considered if Allah should take away your hearing and your eyesight, and seal your hearts, who is there other than Allah than which He will bring you back?
Say: "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes to you or openly, will it be destroyed except the unjust people?"
And We send not the Messengers to give good news to those who have faith and warners, and those who believe and mend the righteous, shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, etc.) are they who will be punished with a painful punishment.
Say: "I do not say to you that I am the treasures of Allah, and I know that I am not the Knower of the unseen, nor do I say to you." Say, "I am only a angel." Say, "To the blind." Say, "The blind is the blind, and it is not for the right."
And warn those who fear their Lord (i.e. the Qur'an) before their Lord (i.e. the Qur'an), and there is none to protect them besides Allah, and that they may be godfearing, and that they may be godfearing.
And do not turn away from those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening, seeking His countenance, and do not leave them on account of what they have earned, and you will not turn away from them, so that you may turn away.
And We made some of them so that they may say: "Are these the ones whom Allah has bestowed upon us?" God is not aware of the mercy of His mercy.
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: Peace be upon you, your Lord has inscribed mercy on Himself. But if any of you is guilty of ignorance, then repents and amends thereafter, then he is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, revelations, etc.).
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah. Say: 'I will not follow your desires, and I will not follow you, and I am not of the guided ones."
Say, "I am a clear proof from my Lord, and I deny you; but there is no matter to me that which you hasten to hasten. This is nothing but Allah, the Truth, and He is the Best of judges."
Say: "If only if you were in doubt for me, I would have settled it between you and you, and Allah is the Knower of the unjust."
And to Him belongs all that is in the unseen, but He knoweth what is in the earth, and He knows what is in the earth, and there is no leaf from it, but there is no leaf but it is in the darkness of the earth and the earth, but it is in a clear Book.
And it is He who takes your souls by night, and He knows what you have done on day, then He raises you up again that a term may be fulfilled; then to Him is your return, and He will inform you of what you did.
And He is the victorious over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, when death comes to death, Our messengers will not die, and they will not take heed.
Then they will be returned to Allah, the Truth, the Truth. He is the decree of His command, and He is the swiftest of reckoning.
Say: "Who rescues you from the land and sea from the sea, when you call upon Him, and call on Him?" Say, "If He delivers us from this, we will surely be of the thankful."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah rescues you from it and from every distress, and you associate others with Him."
Say: "It is He Who will remove you from your feet, or from beneath your feet, or to make you successors, and make you taste the violence of others, and make you taste the violence of others."
And your people denied it, and it is truth. Say, "I am not responsible to do."
And it is a time for every appointed time, and you will know.
And when you see those who dispute in Our signs, then turn away from them until they engage in other disputes. And if Satan makes you forget, then do not sit after the unjust people.
And those who guard (against evil) are those who fear Allah (i.e. Allah), and do not leave them (i.e. those who are pious in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), so that they may be cautious.
And for those who take their religion as sport and sport, and the life of this world is the life of the world, and the Qur'an is a part of the affairs of the world. And if any of them will not have any protector, there will be no protector for him. And if it be not for him, it will not be for him, and that they shall have no protector. And if it be not for him, it will be a drink for them, and a painful punishment.
Say: "Shall we call upon any other than Allah, or can He not grant us any benefit, or will we turn back to the right path? Then if we turn back to the path of the devil, he will turn away from them, and turn away from him a way to the right path. Say: "The path of Allah is on the right path, and to us is the right path."
“And (remember) the prayer (prayer), and fear Him, and fear Him, and He is to you to be gathered to Him.”
And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth, and on the Day of Resurrection He will say: "Be!" and he says, "This is the truth," and when the Trumpet is blown, the trumpet will be blown to Him, and He is the Knower of the unseen, the Knower.
And remember when Ibrahim said to his father Azar: "Do you take gods for gods?
And thus did We show Ibrahim the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be among those who are certain.
And when the night came to pass, he saw a star; he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "I do not love anyone."
And when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when he saw it, he said, "Unless my Lord does not guide me, I will surely be among those who are astray."
And when he saw the sun rising, he said: This is my Lord; this is greater than this; but when it came to pass, he said: O my people! I am quit of what you associate with Him.
I have turned myself to Him, who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the polytheists.
And his people disputed with him, saying, "Why do you argue with me concerning Allah?" He said, "I will not fear what I associate with you. I fear that my Lord will not desire anything to please. But if you do not believe, then you will not believe."
How should I fear what you associate with Him, when you fear not that which He has sent down to you? But if you know what has been sent down to you, then it is better than the two parties.
As for those who believe and do not believe, and those who have faith in their faith, these are the ones who have faith and are guided.
And this is our argument which We gave to Ibrahim to his people, to whom We will to whom We please; surely your Lord is All-knowing, All-knowing.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and We gave him the guidance, and of his descendants, and Sulaiman, and Sulaiman, and Yusuf, and Joseph and Aaron and Aaron and Aaron, and thus do We reward the righteous.
And Zachariah and John, and Jesus, and Elias, each one of the righteous.
And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot and Lot, and each of them We preferred to excel.
And We have made, and of their descendants, and their offspring, and their brethren, and We guided them to a straight path.
Such is the guidance of Allah, He guides whomever He wills. And if they associate others with others, they would have destroyed what they have done.
Those are the ones whom We gave to the Book and wisdom and prophethood, but if they do not believe in this Qur'an, We have made it a people who disbelieve not.
These are those whom Allah has guided, and they follow their guidance. Say: "No reward I ask for you. This is a reminder for the worlds."
And they had not taken Allah's command for him. They said: "Why have not the Qur'an not sent down to you the Book which has been sent down to Moses?" Say: "What has Moses sent down to Moses?" And the guidance of mankind, and the guidance which ye did not know, and that which ye did not know, and what ye did not know.
And this is the Book which We have sent down to you, confirming that which is before it, and that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it, and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they pay their prayers.
And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah, or says, "What has been sent down to me, or what has been sent down to me?" He said, "I am sent down to the Book." And if you see, then the angels will bite with their hands, and say, "What is the Book of God?" And if you see, then the angels will be with them, and you will not be dealt with them.
And you have come to Us as We created you, and We have left behind you behind what We have given you, and We do not see your intercessors with you. We see you with what you asserted, and what you asserted.
It is Allah Who splits the grain and the date, and He brings forth the living from the dead from the dead, and it is Allah Who brings forth the living from the dead, and it is Allah Who is the <unk>.
It is He who causes the dawn, and He has made the night and the moon, and He has made the sun the moon and the moon, for He is the Mighty, the Knowing.

As for those who reject Our signs, and do not turn away from them, the gates of heaven will not be opened to them, nor will they enter the garden until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. Thus do We recompense the guilty.
They will have a bed of fire, and coverings with them. Thus We recompense the wrongdoers.
And as for those who believe and do good works, We impose no soul beyond any soul except for any soul. These are the dwellers of Paradise, therein, they are forever.
And We shall remove their hearts with their hearts, and they will say, "Praise to us." They will say, "Praise to us. Had God not guided us, we would not have been guided.
