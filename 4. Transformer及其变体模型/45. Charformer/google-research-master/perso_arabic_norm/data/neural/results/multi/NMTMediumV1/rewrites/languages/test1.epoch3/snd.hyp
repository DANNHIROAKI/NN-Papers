And among mankind are those who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and in the Day of Judgment they are not believers.
And Allah is the disbelievers, the disbelievers, and they do not worship themselves, but they do not believe.
Their hearts is sickness in their hearts, but they have been given their hearts. They will have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Do not corruption in the earth, and do not be in the land."
Indeed, they do not understand in the love of the corrupters.
