The Beneficent of the Merciful, the Most Merciful,
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all Being.
The Beneficent, the Merciful.
Master of the Day of Resurrection.
You will be your worship, and we do not help Him.
Guide us to the straight path,
The path of those who have bestowed upon you (O Muhammad SAW), and those who have no power to frustrate the wrath of Allah (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).
Alif Lam Mim.
This is the Book. There is no doubt in it for those who fear God.
Who believe in the unseen, and perform prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was revealed before you, and they believe in the Hereafter.
These are on guidance from their Lord, and it is they who are the successful.
Verily those who disbelieve (O Muhammad SAW) (O Muhammad SAW) are not to warn them, nor do you warn them, or do not believe.
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their eyes is a covering, and a great punishment awaits them.
And among mankind are those who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers.
They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they do not know, but they are not aware.
In their hearts is a disease, and their hearts are in doubt, and they will have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them: "Make not mischief in the earth," they say: "We are only peacemakers."
Indeed, they are the ones who do not perceive, and they do not perceive.
And when it is said to them: "Believe in what they have believed," they say: "Shall we believe in those who believe?" But they do not believe.
And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe. And when they are alone with their Shaitans, they say: We are with you; we are only mocking.
Allah mocks them, and letteth them wander blindly in their exorbitance.
These are those who have bartered guidance for guidance, and they have no sense of it, and they have not been guided.
Their example is like those who kindled a fire, and when it lit to him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, unable to see.
Deaf, dumb, and blind.
Or like a rainstorm from heaven, from which is darkness, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, and lightning. They fear their fingers in their ears. God encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away their sight. When they see it, they walk on it, and when they walk on it, they walk in it. But if Allah willed, He could have made them hearing and vision. And Allah is Able to do all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord Who created you and those before you, so that you may be cautious.
Who has made the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy, and sent down water from the sky, so that He may give you fruits for food, so that you may not ascribe up rivals to Allah.
And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to the Messenger, then produce a surah like it, and call upon Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do not, and you will not be able to do, and fear the Fire whose fuel will be the fuel of the Fire and prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good works, that they shall be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall be given to drink of it. They will say: "This is what we had been given before." They will have whatever they have been given, and they will live therein forever, and they will abide therein forever.
Allah has not ashamed a example for the people of a gnat or a gnat. The unbelievers are those who believe in their Lord, and who believe in the truth, and who say, "This is what Allah has made for you?" They are more than a people who does greater than Allah, and He does not guide them.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the earth. These are the losers.
How do you disbelieve in Allah, and He gave you life? Then He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, and He will bring you back to life, to Him you will be returned.
He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then He Istawa the heaven to the heaven, and He made them seven heavens, and He has knowledge of all things.
And when your Lord said to the angels: Lo! I am a viceroy on the earth, they said: Wilt thou not shed the earth? And We said, 'We shall make you praise and shed Your praise, and sanctify Your Lord, and know what you do not know.'
And He taught Adam the names of Adam, and He fulfilled them with their names, and said: "Tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You! You have no knowledge except that You have taught us. Indeed, You are the Wise, the Wise."
He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names. Then when He brought them their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth? I know what you hide and what you disclose."
And when We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam,’ they bowed down, except Iblis; he refused to be proud, and became one of the faithless.
And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and eat of it wherever ye eat thereof, and do not approach this tree, lest ye shall be of the wrong-doers.
Then Satan turned away from them, and they said, “Go down with it,” and We said to them, “Go down from the land; you shall be enemies to the earth and you shall be a dwelling of the earth.”
Then Adam received his Lord's command, and relented towards his Lord. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
We said, "Go down from it," and when there comes to you a guidance from Me, those who follow My guidance will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant to you, and fulfill your covenant, and fear Me.
And believe in what has been sent down to you from the Torah, and do not believe in it, and do not exchange the punishment for a paltry price, and fear Me and fear Me.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly.
And perform the prayer, and pay the zakat, and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin the good of the good, and do not forget your eyes? Do you not understand?
And help you with patience and prayer, and indeed, it is a great success.
Those who do not believe in their Lord, and to Him they are returned.
O Children of Israel, remember My blessing wherewith I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you above the nations.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when We delivered you from Fir'aun's people, who were afflicting you with a horrible torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and that there was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you, so We drowned you and drowned Pharaoh's people and you were drowned.
And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to Musa (Moses), and We gave them a calf (in worship) after the calf (i.e. the time of Musa (Moses)], and ye were Zalimun (polytheists, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).
Then We pardoned you so that you might be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you might be guided.
And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: "O my people! Verily, I have made you a calf from your Lord, so turn your back to your Creator, and kill you, and turn your back to your Creator (i.e. your Lord's Religion), and turn your back to your Creator (i.e. you will be able to turn back to your Lord), and be grateful for Him. Verily, He is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
And when you said, “O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah’s signs, when you were seized with the thunderbolt.”
Then We brought you back to life, that you may be grateful.
And We sent down upon you the clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails, saying, "Eat of what We have given you, and do not transgress in the earth, but they wronged themselves."
And when We said, “Enter this town, and eat plentifully of it wherever you enter it, and say, ‘‘Relieve us with your sins, and say, ‘‘Relieve us with your sins; We shall increase the gooddoers.”
But the evildoers changed the word that they had been told. So We sent down upon them the punishment of the heaven, so that they may be drowned.
And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to his people, We said: "Strike the rock with your staff." But twelve springs gushed out from it, but each of them are drinking-springs: "Eat of what Allah has provided for you, and do not mischief in the earth, and do not mischief in the earth."
And when Moses said to them: "Make a place of the land, we shall not be able to make it a place of the land, and we will not be able to make it a place of the land, and to make a place of the two of them." And when the two of them are enemies to you, the enemy of the two-doers, and the other-place, so that it may be for those who believe and do not believe in the way of Allah, and destroy the calf, and disobeyed the prophets and disobeyed the prophets, because they disobeyed the truth.
Those who believe, and the Jews and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and believes in Allah and the Last Day, will have their reward with their Lord, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you, and We revealed to you the Mount (saying): "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you may be cautious."
Then ye turned back after you and turned back from the Grace of Allah and His mercy, and you were not of the losers.
And you know of the example of the Sabbath. We said to them, ‘Be apes, despised, and We were with you apes.”
Then We made it a precedent and a example for those who passed away, and a lesson for the righteous.
And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: "Verily, Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said: "Do you give us a mockery?" He said: "I fear Allah's command, for I should be ignorant."
They said: Call upon your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what she says. He said: Lo! Allah is a cow, neither between us nor virgin, middling between them, so that ye may be commanded.
They said: Call upon your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what He says. He said: Lo! He says: He is a cow and yellow to the beholders.
They said: "Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what we may be in the form of the cow, and we may be able to hide it. And if Allah wills, we will be guided."
He said, ‘He says, ‘He says, she is a cow, neither yoked to plow the earth, nor to irrigate the field, nor to irrigate the field, and they sacrificed her.” They said, “Now I brought it to a light, so that they may be sacrificed.”
And when We slew a man, then he slew you, and that which ye were hiding.
So We said, “Strike him with a piece of the earth.” So Allah gives life to the dead, and shows you the dead, so that you may understand.
Then, after that, after your hearts, they became rocks and became rocks. And there are rocks from which rivers gush forth from them. And there are rocks from which rivers gush forth from them, and there are rocks from it, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you then hope that they will believe in you, and some of the people who have heard the word of Allah? Then, when they heard it, they knowingly misinterpret it.
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe." When they are alone, they say, "We believe in what has been revealed to you," they say, "When only you are with the knowledge with your Lord?" Say, "Do you not understand?
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose?
And there are among them illiterates who do not know the Book, but they know the truth, but they are only guessing.
So woe to those who write the Book before it, and they say, “This is from Allah.” So woe to them for what they have earned, and woe to what they have earned, and woe to what they have earned.
And they say, “The Fire will not touch us for a limited number of days.’ Say, ‘Do you not know what Allah has sent down to you? Do you not know that Allah does not know what you do not know?”
Nay, but whosoever earns evil and his evil deeds, they are the fellows of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
But those who believe and do good works, they are the dwellers of Paradise, and they will abide therein forever.
And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: 'You shall not be any other than Allah, nor shall the parents and the near relatives, and the orphans, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and give the alms, and you turned back and turned away.
And when We made a covenant with you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Do not shed your blood,” and you took your homes from your homes, and you will testify, and you are witnesses.
You are your enemies to kill the people who were enemies to you, and made a group of the people of a group of you, and you have made a agreement to you, and you will not return to one another. And if you do not believe, you will not have a share of the life of this world, and you will not believe in the life of this world, and you will have a share of the life of this world, and fear the punishment of Allah. Indeed, Allah is not unaware of what you do.
These are those who buy the life of this world for the Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book, and We sent with them a apostle, and supported him with the Prophets, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit, and We supported him with a light that came to you with your mouths, and you did not suit it, and some of you slew the calf, and some of you slew the truth and slew the disbelievers.
And they say, “Our hearts are uncircumcised.’ Rather, Allah has cursed them because of what they used to do.
And when a Book had been revealed to them from the Book, confirming what is before them, confirming what was before them, and they would be asked to pray to those who disbelieved, but when they had recognised it, they disbelieved in it. And the curse of Allah is upon the disbelievers.
What is they that they sold their souls in the cause of Allah, that they may disbelieve in what Allah has sent down to His servants, that they may be averse to Allah's wrath, that He may lead them with His wrath upon whom He has sent down, and for them is a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them: "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say: "We believe in what has been sent down to us," and they believe in what is revealed to them: "What is the matter with you?" Say, "Have you been sent to you the Messenger, if you are truthful?"
Moses came to you with clear proofs, but you took the calf after you, and you took the calf.
And when We took a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, they said: "Hold firmly to what We have given you," and said: "We hear and obey." And they said, "We hear and follow the calf." Say, "It is only your faith, if you are believers."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If the Home of the Hereafter (i.e. the Hereafter of Allah and the Hereafter) is in the Hereafter (i.e. the Day of Resurrection, etc.), if you are truthful, then, if you are truthful."
And they will never wish for it because of what their hands have sent ahead, and Allah knows best the unjust.
And verily, you will find them to die in the life of the life of the world (i.e. the life of the world, i.e. the life of the world (Muhammad SAW) and the idolaters (i.e. the life of the life of the world (Muhammad SAW)], for them is a thousand years of a thousand years. But if he had a thousand years, he will not be able to give them a thousand years. And Allah sees all that they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel)], then he is an enemy to your heart (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)], and the Gospel (i.e. the Taurat (Gospel)] has been revealed to you (i.e. the Taurat (Gospel)], and the Gospel (i.e. the Taurat (Gospel)], confirming that which was before it (i.e. the Taurat (Gospel)], and a guidance and glad tidings to those who believe.
Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His angels and the Michael, and Gabriel and Michael, and Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.
We have sent down to you the verses, so that they may deny the truth.
Is it a time that they made a covenant, some of them cast it aside? But most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah, confirming that which is in the Book, confirming what they were given to those who were given the Book, and they know not.
And they made a breach to the people of the Mount, and they were in the state of the Mount, and they said: "This is the same, and we have not been killed." They said, "Show us the same, and we have not been killed." They have done a burden to those who have been killed, and they have forgotten it. So those who do not believe in this world and the Hereafter, and they have followed it. So those who have been given the life of the world who have been given a few of it, so that they should have nothing to have a few of it. And those who do not believe in this world is greater than what they used to do.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, He would have better reward for them, but most of them would be aware.
O you who believe! Do not say to the believers, "Do not listen to it," and say, "Unzurna," and listen to a painful punishment.
The unbelievers among the People of the Book and the polytheists have not been given to the idolaters, except that you may be sent down to you from your Lord. God chooses His Mercy to whomever He wills. God is the Lord of great bounty.
And if We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We bring it forth better than it, or similar it to it, or know that Allah is over all things competent.
Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? And besides Allah, you have no protector nor helper.
Or do you ask your Messenger to be questioned before you? And he who believed in his faith, he is more guided for him, and he has strayed from the right path.
Many of the People of the Book wish that they may turn back to you, after they have believed, and disbelieve in their hearts, after they have become clear to you. So pardon, and overlook, and overlook. Allah has power over all things.
And give the poor-rate and pay the poor-rate, and give it to your own souls; and whatever you do with good, Allah is cognisant of what you do.
And they say: "None will enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." These are their people who say: "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Yes, but whosoever submits his Lord with Allah and does good, his reward is with his Lord, and no fear shall be upon them, nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians are Christians." The Christians say, "The Jews are not in the same." But they will say, "The Jews, and the Christians." But those who do not follow the Book, say, "God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection."
And who does greater wrong than he who bars the name of Allah in the name of Allah, and striveth not to them, and striveth in the places of the garden? They shall not be helped in this world, and they shall have a great punishment.
And to Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever you turn towards Him; surely Allah is the Embracer, the Knower.
They say: "Allah has begotten a son." Glory be to Him! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. To Him all things are obedient.
Creator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees a thing, He only says to it: Be, and it is.
And those who do not believe say: "Why does Allah not speak to us a sign?" Say, "The word of Allah has not come to us." Have they not before those before them? They are the ones who are before, and We have made plain the signs for a people who believe.
We have sent you as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and to warn you, and you will not be questioned.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor follow the Christians. Say, "This is the guidance of Allah." And if you follow the guidance, then follow their desires, then follow their desires after the knowledge has come to you. And if you follow their desires, you will have no protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book and read it as it ought to read it. Those who believe in it will be the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you above the nations.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall intercession be accepted, nor shall they be helped.
And (remember) when Ibrahim (Abraham) said to his Lord (Abraham), and said: "Verily, I am a leader of you." And He said: "O my Lord! Verily, I have appointed a covenant for you, and I shall make you a covenant from my descendants, and say: "My Lord does not include me."
And [remember] when We made the House a place of a place of prayer and a place of safety for the people, and We said to him: "Take the place of Abraham, and take the House of Ishmael for those who have been given to Abraham and Ishmael, and purify themselves and those who bow around it."
And when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this a city of peace, and provide them with a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day.” He said, “We will give a increase of the punishment of the Fire, and I will drive him into a terrible punishment.”
And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, and prayed, “Our Lord, accept this from us. You are the Hearer, the Knower.”
Our Lord, make us submissive to our Lord, and make us submissive to our descendants, and make us submissive to Your mercy, and forgive us and forgive us. You are the Forgiving, the Merciful."
Our Lord, raise them to a people from among them, who will recite to them Your revelations and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are the Almighty, the Wise."
And who is more in religion than he who follows the religion of Allah, and he chose him? We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I have submitted to the Lord of the Universe,
And Abraham (Abraham) said to his sons: "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you the religion (of religion), and to make the religion (of worship) that Allah will not believe in the Muslims.
Why, when the children of the children reached you, he said to his sons: "Who will serve you?" They said: "We will worship what you are commanded to me." He said: "O Allah, the Creator of your fathers, and Ishmael, and Isaac and Isma'il, and to Him we submit."
That is a community that has passed away. Theirs shall be repaid for what they have earned and what you do.
And they say: "Become Jews or Christians, and follow the way of Abraham," they say: "We follow the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say: "We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and Jesus and their descendants from their Lord. We make no distinction between them, and to Him we submit."
And if they believe in Allah, they are rightly guided. And if they turn away, they will be turned away. And if they turn away, then lo! Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.
Allah's coloring is better than us, and who is better than Allah? And we are our worshippers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you dispute about us about Allah? Our Lord is our Lord, and our Lord, and our Lord, and we have brought your trust, and we are your Best of Him.
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, were Jews or Christians? Say: 'Do you know that Allah knows the truth? Who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.'
That is a nation who have passed away. Theirs will have what they have earned, and you will be questioned about what you used to do.
The foolish among the people will say, "What has turned them away from the qiblah of their qiblah?" Say, "To Allah belong the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path."
And thus We have made you a temptation, that you may be a enemy to the people, and the Messenger, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the one who followed him, and he turned back to his heels, and he turned back to his heels, and it is not for those who believe, so that Allah may guide those who believe, for He is the most merciful of the merciful.
We have seen you turning your face to the heaven, and We will make you see the Qiblah that you may please, and you will turn your faces towards the direction of the Sacred Mosque, and turn your faces towards the direction of the Sacred Mosque. That is the truth from your Lord. So do not be the truth. Indeed, Allah is not unaware of what they do.
And if they come to you in the Book, they will not follow you, nor follow their qiblah, nor follow the qiblah of those who follow the Book; and if you follow their desires, they follow it. And if you follow the knowledge after the knowledge, then follow it, and you will be among the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We have given the Book recognise him as they recognize their own sons, and some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.
And every one is one who turns away from it, and vie towards you in good works. Wheresoever you may be, Allah will bring you together. Indeed, Allah has power over all things.
And whencesoever you turn away from it, and the Holy Mosque may come to you from your Lord. Indeed, your Lord is not unaware of what you do.
And when you turn forth from your face, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your faces towards the direction of the Sacred Mosque, and do not obey them, and do not fear them, and fear them. And fear Me, so that you may be cautious.
(Muhammad), We have sent to you a Messenger from among you, who recites to you Our revelations and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and give thanks to Me and do not be ungrateful.
O you who have believed, help your patience and help the prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the steadfast.
And do not say to those who are slain in the way of Allah, "They are dead." Rather, they are living to understand.
And We will surely test you with fear and hunger and hunger, and loss of goods and lives and crops. Give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere.
Those who are afflicted by a affliction, say: "We are Allah's, and we are all obedient to Him."
They are those who are on their Lord and His mercy, and they are the guided.
Safa and Marwa are in the sight of Allah; and whoever is a pilgrimage on the House, he will not be able to visit the House, or visit the House. And whoever volunteers good spontaneously, it is to Allah, and Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance which We have sent down to the Book after the Book has been revealed to them, Allah will curse them with the cursers, and curse them for the cursers.
Except those who repent and amend and make manifest the truth. And I am the Forgiving, the Merciful.
Those who disbelieve, and die, and die, will be the curse of Allah and the angels and all of them.
They will live forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
And your God is Allah, there is no god but He, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, and the day that He has sent forth from the sky, and He revives the earth after its death, and He revives the heavens and the earth, and in the heavens and the earth. Surely in that are signs for a people who reflect.
And among mankind are those who take up rivals to Allah. They love the love of Allah. Those who believe in Allah and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and when they see the punishment, know that Allah is severe in punishment.
And when those who followed the truth, they will be able to see the punishment, and they will see that which they have been doing.
And the disbelievers will say, “If only we had a chance, we would disown them, and disown them.’ They will have covered them with what Allah has given them, and they will not be able to protect them from the Fire.
O mankind! Eat of what is in the earth and that which is lawful for you, and follow the footsteps of Satan. Lo! he is a open enemy to you.
He only commands you to commit evil and indecency, and that you may know what you do not know.
And when it is said to them: "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say: "We follow what our fathers had found to follow, and we found our fathers following guidance."
And the parable of those who disbelieve is the likeness of a man who calls to the call of a soothsayer, and calls not to the call of the call, and they are deaf.
O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and give thanks to Allah, and be grateful to Him.
He has forbidden for you the flesh of the animals and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine. And if any one does not exceed the limit of necessity, any sin or transgressing, he eats it. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Book, and purchase a small price for them, they shall have nothing to eat their bellies, and they will not speak to Allah on the Day of Resurrection, nor shall He purify them. Theirs will have a painful punishment.
These are those who have bartered guidance for guidance, and forgiveness for forgiveness. So woe to them for the punishment of the Fire.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth, and in the matters of those who differ.
And to the East and the West, it is He who has sent down to you the first of the heavens and the earth, the feeding of the needy and the emigrants, and the needy and the emigrants, and the needy and the needy, and the needy and the needy, and the wayfarer, and those who are near, and those who keep their homes, and those who keep their homes and those who are steadfast, and those who keep their homes, and those who keep their homes, and those who are steadfast, and they are truthful.
O ye who believe! Lo! there is no sin for you in the life of the world, and there is no one of you who is a woman's wife, and she is a woman who carries his burden to her, and the she's wife is a woman who is an woman of his burden. And it is that which he hath made to be fair to him, and he who is a believer, that it may be a sign from his Lord. And whosoever transgresses in this, then verily, a grievous doom hath come to him.
And in the life of this world is a lesson for you, so that you may be cautious.
If he approaches you to death, he would bequeath it back to you, and he leaves his parents to be near, and he is a duty to the righteous.
Then whoever changes a bequest after it has come to it, it is no sin on it. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
But if any one fears the sin or a sin, and makes a reconciliation between the parties, he shall be concerned between the parties; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, that We may make it mandatory for those before you, that you may be cautious.
(Fasting) on the day of a day when the two number of the two days met a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of days. The feeding of those who do not have a redemption, the feeding of a man who is needy. And if it is better for him, he is better for him.

And to confirm the Book which was revealed to me, confirming the Taurat of which I have forbidden to you, and to make lawful for you from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me and obey me.
Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord; so serve Him. This is the straight path.
When Jesus sensed their disbelief, he said: "Who will be my helpers to Allah?" The disciples said: "We believe in Allah and the helpers of Allah. We believe in Allah and we bear witness to Him."
Our Lord! We believe in what Thou hast sent down, and we follow the Messenger, so follow us and those who follow us.'
And they schemed, and Allah planned; and Allah is the Best of planners.
And when Allah said, “O Jesus, I shall raise you to Myself and purify you with those who follow you, and to purify you with those who follow the truth, and the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me you will return, and I will judge between you regarding what you used to differ.”
As for those who disbelieved, I shall chastise them with the punishment of this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.
And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them full of full in full; and Allah does not love the unjust.
This is how We recite to you the verses and the wisdom.
And Allah's son is a example of the people of Adam. He created him from dust, then He said to him, "Be," and it was.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.
Then whoever disputes with you after the knowledge after the knowledge has come to you, say: 'Come to our sons, and let us summon our sons and your sons, and our women, and our women, and ourselves, and ourselves, and pray upon Us, and pray upon the liars.
This is the true story. There is no god but He, and He is the Almighty, the Wise.
But if they turn away, then surely Allah knows the agents of corruption.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Come to the Book between us and you, and we have no partner to Allah, and we worship none but Allah, and we have no partner to Him, and we have no partner to Him." And if they turn away, then say: "Bear witness that we are Muslims."
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham, and the Torah and the Gospel? Why do you not make it clear? Do you not understand?
What is the matter with you that you dispute about that which you have knowledge. Do you not know that Allah knows what you do not know?
Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian; and he was a Muslim of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists.
Verily, the nearest (Abraham) of Ibrahim (Abraham), Abraham (Abraham), the people of Ibrahim (Abraham), the Messenger (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism). And Allah is the Protector of the believers.
A party of the People of the Book would fain lead you astray, but they lead themselves astray, but they do not perceive.
O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah, while you are witnesses?
O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?
And a party of the People of the Book said: "Believe in what has been sent down to the believers in the beginning of the day (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel)], so that they may turn back (in the truth), so that they may turn back."
And do not follow the religion of those who follow the religion after you have come to you. Say, ‘Do you believe in your Lord?’ Say, ‘Do not believe in your Lord.’ Say, ‘God is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.” And if He wills, He gives it to whomever He wills, and He gives whomever He wills, and He is the All-knowing, the All-knowing.
He singles to His mercy whom He wills. God is the Lord of great bounty.
And of the People of the Book is he who turns back to you, and if you entrust him with a heap of it, he will not be able to restore you back to him. And if you entrust him, he will not be able to stand with him. They say, "These are Christians," and they say, "We are Christians." But they are a false people.
Yes, whoever fulfills his covenant and fears Allah, and Allah loves the pious.
Those who sell the covenant of Allah for a small price. They have no share in the Hereafter, nor shall Allah speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will they be able to do them. And Allah will give them a great punishment, and they will have a painful punishment.
And among them is a section who twist the Book with their tongues, that you may understand the Book, and they say, "This is from God." Say, "It is from God." But it is from Allah that they speak themselves from it, and they knowingly speak lies to Allah.
It is not for a human being that Allah should give the Book to the wisdom and the Prophethood, and He would say to him, "Be my worshippers besides Allah." Say, "Indeed my Lord is my Lord, who has taught you the Book, so that you may be studying."
And the angels came to you, saying, "Why did you not take your religion to be a Messenger from Allah?" So, if they were Muslims, He will say to you, "Do you believe in your disbelief?"
And when We gave the covenant to the Prophets, saying, “Believe in the Book, confirming what has been sent down to you, and what has come to you.’ And when you come to him, he said, ‘Do not follow your pledge, and do not go back to the people, and say, ‘We are Christians.’ And when it said, “Be your witnesses,’ and say, ‘I am witness to you, and I am witness to you.”
But those who turn away from it, it is they who are the transgressors.
Do they seek a religion other than Allah, and to Him is the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, willingly and unwillingly?
Say: "We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been sent down to us and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and the Prophets from their Lord, and we do not believe in it, and to Him we submit.
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and he will be in the Hereafter.
How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief, and that they may believe in the truth, and that the truth had come to them? And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Those are they who will have their reward to Allah, the angels, and the angels,
Abiding therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor shall they be reprieved.
Except those who repent after that and amend, and know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who believe after their faith and turned into disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted for them. They are the people who are astray.
As for those who disbelieve, and die, and die, they will not be accepted by a earthful of gold, even if they offered a ransom to ransom. They will have a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers.
Do not be like those who strive in the way of Allah, that you may give charity to you. God knows whatever you do.
The children of Israel was lawful to the Children of Israel, "Why do you kill the children of Israel after the Torah had been mentioned before them?" Say, "Bring down the Torah, if you are truthful."
Then whoever fabricates lies against Allah, verily it is they who are the unjust.
Say, ‘God has spoken the truth, so follow the creed of Abraham, the Monotheist, the Monotheist.”
The first House (Mecca) was one of the people (Makkah) (Mecca) (Mecca) as a blessed (Mecca) (Mecca), a guidance (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and a guidance for all mankind.
In it is clear signs. The people of Abraham is a place of security. He who enters the House to be a place of the House, and he who is a pilgrimage to the House for the House. But if it is to Allah, he will take it back to Him. God is Independent of the worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, and that Allah is witness to what you do?"
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Why do you hinder those who believe in the way of Allah (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and make the way of those who do not believe in it? And Allah is not unaware of what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey a party of the People of the Book, they will turn you back after you, after you will disbelieve.
And how is it that you disbelieve in Allah's revelations, and that you may recite His revelations to you and His Messenger? And Allah will guide him on the right path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah and be wary of Him, and do not die.
And hold fast to the rope of Allah with the rope of Allah; and when He has made you successors, you will have made your hearts firm, and He made you taste the hearts of the people, and He made you taste the brink of the Fire, and He made you taste the brink of the Fire, and He saved you from your religion, so that you may be guided.
And there shall be a group among you who invite you to the right and enjoin the good and forbid what is in the right. These are the successful.
And do not be like those who were divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. For them is a terrible punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be bright, and some faces will be black, and they will be told: "Did you disbelieve after your belief? Then taste what you used to deny."
And as for those whose faces are white, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the verses of Allah, which We recite to you in truth; and Allah does not guide any injustice to the worlds.
And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And to Allah all things return.
You are the people of the city, which We have sent forth for mankind, enjoining what is wrong, enjoining what is wrong, and do good, and if you believe in Allah and the Book, it would have been better for them. Some of them are believers, and most of them are believers.
They will not be able to harm you; and if they fight you, they will turn their backs, and they will not be helped.
They will have been defeated from Allah, and there is disgrace from them. They have incurred the anger of Allah and has incurred anger from them. They have incurred the signs of God and slew the prophets and slew the prophets unjustly. That is because they disobeyed the signs of Allah and did not transgress.
They are not alike in the Book, but those who recite the revelations of Allah in the night, and prostrate themselves in the night.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is right and forbid the righteous. These are the righteous.
And they will not be recompensed for what they do; and Allah knows the well-fearing.
Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah. These are the inmates of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
The parable of that which they expend in the life of this world is as a likeness of a wind, a wind which smites the people of a people who have wronged themselves, and destroys it. Allah does not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.
O you who have faith! Do not take up your religion as allies, lest they will not be able to harm you. They love you with their tongues. Hatred is worse than their mouths. We have given you a clear sign, so that you may understand.
Those are you who love you in love, and you love them, and you have faith in the Book; and when they are in the faith, they say, “We believe,” and when they are alone, they bite their fingers in rage. Say, ‘Die in your rage.” Say, ‘Die in your rage; indeed Allah knows the thoughts within the breasts.”
If good befalls you, it grieves them, but if evil befalls you, they rejoice at it; and if you are patient, they rejoice in it, and do not harm you in the least; and Allah encompasses what they do.
(Muhammad), when he reached the house of the morning that they met in the battle of the battle of the battle, and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
When two groups among you were about to lose it, and Allah was the Protector of those who believe.
And Allah had already helped you with Badr, that you might be victorious, and that you may be grateful.
And when you said to the believers, “Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?”
Yes, if you are patient and Godwary, and the enemy overtakes you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels marked.
And Allah has not sent you as a glad tidings for the glad tidings that you may give glad tidings to your hearts. Victory is only from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise.
That He might cut off the unbelievers from their hearts, or that they may return back to their destruction.
It is not for any of you that He may forgive you, or punish them, and they are unjust.
And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and redoubled, and fear Allah, so that you may prosper.
And guard yourselves against the Fire.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, that you may be shown mercy.
And seek forgiveness for your Lord and His forgiveness and the earth which is in the heavens and the earth, prepared for the pious.
Those who spend in prosperity and adversity, and restrain the anger of Allah, and restrain the anger of Allah; and Allah loves those who do good.
And those who, when they commit a indecency, do not make their own wrong-doing, and remember Allah's forgiveness, and ask forgiveness for their sins. And who does not persist in Allah's way, and that wittingly.
Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the reward of those who do good.
Many eras have passed before you. So travel in the land and see what was the end of the deniers.
This is a exposition for mankind, a guidance and a admonition for those who guard (against evil).
And do not weaken, nor grieve, and you will be superior.
If a wound has touched you, a similar wound has touched them, and We have made the example of men to be men, so that they may return to the people, and Allah has shown you the truth, and He does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may purge those who believe and do the unbelievers.
What, do you think that you will enter Paradise in the cause of Allah, that Allah has not yet tested those who strive in His cause and who are steadfast?
You were longing before death before you met you, and you have seen it, and you have seen.
Muhammad is only a messenger, before whom the Messengers passed before him, and they will be slain, or turn back to your heels, or he will turn back on your heels, and then will turn back to your heels. God will reward the thankful.
It is not for any soul to die except by Allah's leave, until He desires to give life to the first of the world. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him the reward of this world, and We will give him the reward of the Hereafter. And We give the reward of the grateful.
And how many a prophet have fought for many men whom they have fought in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken. And Allah loves those who are steadfast.
And they said, “Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins and our feet, and help us against the faithless.”
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will become losers.
Indeed, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve in their hearts, that they may have no partner to Allah, that He has sent down to them what He has sent down, and their abode is the Fire.
And indeed Allah has promised you the truth, that you may come to you in the midst of Allah, and He has made you rulers in the matter, and He made you rulers in the matter, and He has made you successors for you, and He has given you the Book, that you may be in the life of the world. And if you have turned to you, you would surely have done evil. And Allah is gracious to you, and He is gracious to the believers.
When you ran away from the side of the rear, and the rear was calling to you, and He took your hands to sorrow for you, and He will not sorrow you, and you will not grieve for what befell you. And Allah is aware of what you do.
Then He caused you back to the people, and He made them rulers in the land, and said: "This is what we have been in." Say, "Do not avail us with what Allah has sent down for us?" They said: "We have not been able." Say, "Do not be able to stay in the end of your homes?" When they are in the presence of Allah, they will have put it back in their homes. Say, "God knows what is in your hearts, so that you may know what is in your hearts. God knows what is in your hearts, and knows what is in the breasts."
On the Day when you will see the day when the two hosts met, they were enemies to the people who had turned away from it. God forgave them. God is Forgiving and Forbearing.
O you who have believed, do not be like those who disbelieve, their brothers who were bent to travel in the land. They said, "Had not been slain, we would not have died." They would not have died, and they would have died. God will raise life to life. He gives life and causes death, and Allah sees what you do.
And if you are killed in the way of Allah, or die, forgiveness, and mercy from Allah, is the best of mercy.
And if ye die or die, verily ye are to be brought back to Allah.
It is gentle to you that the mercy of Allah is gentle to you. If they have been harsh, they would have dispersed you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them with forgiveness and consult them with the forgiveness of Allah. And when you were resolved, then put your trust in Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who rely.
If Allah supports you, no one can overcome you, but if He forsakes you, then He will help you. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
It is not for a prophet that he may be treacherous, and whosoever fulfills the covenant of the Day of Resurrection, it will be paid up for his soul, and every soul will be repaid for what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah, one who follows the wrath of Allah, is his refuge in Hell, and his destination is Hell, an terrible destination?
They are in varying ranks, and Allah sees what they do.
Verily Allah hath conferred a favour upon the believers, that He sent unto them a apostle from among themselves, reciting to them His revelations and purifying them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom, though they were in manifest error.
Then, when a affliction befell you, albeit a disaster befell you, they said, “What is the matter?” Say, ‘It is from your own selves.” Indeed, Allah has power over all things.
And what befell you on the day when the two hosts met in the permission of Allah, and that He might test the believers.
And that He might know the hypocrites, when they said: 'Fight in the way of Allah, or fight in the fight.' They said: 'If we knew, we would not have followed you.' They were nearer than unbelief than belief. They said, “We have been given the faith of the believers.” God knows what they hide.
Those who were Jews will say to their brothers, "Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed." Say, "Then avert death, if you are truthful."
And do not think those who are slain in the way of Allah, but they are dead. They are in their Lord's sight.
They rejoice in what Allah has given them of His bounty, and they rejoice in what they have been given, and they have not yet joined them, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the bounty of Allah and His bounty, and Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to Allah and the Messenger after they had been wounded, so that they may be wounded, and do righteous good deeds, for them is a great reward.
Those who have said to the people who said: "We have gathered to you, so fear them, and fear them." But they said: "Allah is Sufficient for us, and He is Sufficient as a Protector."
So they returned upon Allah's grace and His grace, and they followed the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is All-pleased with Him.
It is only Satan who frightens you, so that you may fear them, so fear Me and fear Me.
And do not be grieved for those who disbelieve, for they will not be able to harm them. Allah does not love those who do not want to do in the Hereafter, and He will give them a great punishment.
Those who do not believe in the price of the believers will not harm them. They will have a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that We shall give them respite for them, but We give them respite for their good deeds, and theirs will be a shameful torment.
It is not for Allah that He will leave the believers for you in the way of the day of which He has sent forth the hearts of those who believe in the earth, and He has given you the good of His Messengers. And if you believe in Allah and His Messengers, He will grant you a good of His mercy. And fear Allah and His Noble Messenger.
And do not let those who withhold their wealth with Allah's bounty, that they should not have been able to do good, but it is worse for them that they may be in the sight of their necks, and they shall be on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is the Inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Aware of what you do.
Allah has heard the statement of those who say: "Allah is poor, and we are rich." And we will say to those who were given the Book, "We will give to the Prophets, and we shall be the punishment of the burning."
This is because of what your hands have sent ahead, and because Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say: "Our Lord has promised us to believe in Allah, that we should not believe in the Messenger." Say, "Messengers have come to me with clear proofs." Say, "Messengers before me came to you with clear proofs before you, if you are truthful."
And if they deny you, (O Muhammad SAW), before them (Prophet Muhammad SAW) before you (Muhammad SAW) and those before you, who denied the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).
Every soul will taste death, and you will be paid back to the Day of Resurrection. And if you will be paid back to the Fire, he will be admitted back to the Fire, and he will be admitted back to the Fire, and the life of this world is nothing but a illusory enjoyment.
You will surely be tested with your possessions and your lives, and you will not be like those who were given the Book before you and those who were given the Book before you, and if you are patient, then be patient, and indeed, Allah is well-pleased with all things.
And when We made a covenant from the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] (the Taurat (Gospel)] made the Taurat (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and the Taurat (i.e. the Taurat (Gospel)], and the Taurat (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] threw it (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and the Injeel (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] threw their backs (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)], and the left (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] threw it (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], so that they may be killed.
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love what they have done, and do not love the punishment of the punishment. They will have a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over all things.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day, there are signs for men of understanding.
Those who remember Allah standing standing and sitting and standing in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and say: "Our Lord! You have not created us from this. Glory be to You! Save us from the punishment of the Fire."
Our Lord! You shall admit him to the Fire, and You shall have no helpers. And the wrong-doers have no helpers.
Our Lord, we have heard the crier calling us calling to faith. Forgive us, "Our Lord! Forgive us, and forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and make us die, and make us die in the righteous."
Our Lord! Grant us what You have promised us with Your words, and humiliate us not on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You are the tryst."
Then, when they return to their Lord, (saying): "O my Lord! You shall not be able to do a man, and shall not make them enter the way of the Garden, and they will not be able to make them live in the way of Allah." And those who are abased will be admitted to Gardens of which rivers flow, and they will enter Paradise. That is the reward of Allah. That is the reward of Allah. That is the supreme success.
(Muhammad), do not be deceived in the land, the disbelievers,
This is a brief enjoyment; and their destination is Hell, and evil is the resort.
But as for those who fear their Lord, they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of Allah which He has promised them. And Allah is best with the righteous.
And of the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to you, and those who believe in Allah's revelations, and barter not a trifling price for those who disbelieve in their Lord. Verily Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! Endure, and be patient, and be steadfast, and fear Allah, so that you may prosper.
O ye who believe! Fear your Lord who created you from a single soul, and He created you from a single soul, and He created you from the two of the two of them, and that ye may be one of the two of you. And fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. Lo! Allah is over you a Watcher.
And give the orphans their property, and do not exchange the defective of their wealth, and do not devour their property with their property. Indeed, it is a great sin.
And if you fear that you should not be able to marry the orphans and the orphans, or marry the women of the two women, or the two of them, or if you marry them, or if you should not be able to marry one another. And do not be one of the two, if one of them is near, and that you may be able to do so.
And give the women their dowries willingly, but if they are given to you, then consume it with a part of it, and give them a little of it.
And do not eat the property of your property that Allah has made for you of the means of which He has provided you, and clothe them and clothe them with their words and speak to them.
And leave the orphans until they reach the age of the near age. And when they come to you, let them go back to them, and do not harass them until they have come to them. And if they suckle it, he will not be able to give it back to the needy. And if he is rich, then let him abstain, and give them their hands, and keep your duty to Us; and Allah is witness to you.
Men shall be a share of what the parents and the near relatives leave, and what is behind him, whether the parents and the near women, whether a little or a little, and a share of what is behind it.
And when the relatives and the orphans are the needy, and the needy, and the needy, give them a little, and speak to them a reputable of them.
And let them fear those who were behind them, and did not return to their homes, and fear Allah, and speak to them.
Those who devour the wealth of the orphans, We shall fill their bellies into the fire, and they will be driven into Hell.
Allah has forbidden you to be a king, and a king to whom He has made the parents, a man to whom He has made a share of the parents. And if they come to you, it is not lawful for them, and if it is to the needy, the orphans, the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and if it is, and if you do not know, and if it has come to you, you will have taken it back to your own selves, and if you have driven back to your own accord, it may be more lawful for you. This is how Allah explains the truth for you, and He is Knowing, Wise.
And if you have made a pledge between you, then that they may find a pledge between you, and if they find a pledge between you, they shall not be able to find a burden between them. And if they are forbidden, they shall not be able to make a burden between them, nor shall they be able to make a burden between them. And if they are to be able to do so, they will be able to be able to make a burden between them. And if one of them is a sin, he will not be able to make it back. And if the one who is an believer, the one who is in his own accord will have the right to make it back. And Allah is All-forgiving and All-aware.
These are the limits of Allah. Whoso obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme triumph.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His bounds, He will admit him into the Fire wherein he will live forever, and for him is a terrible punishment.
And as for those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse, then produce four witnesses against them; if they testify to their houses, confine them to their houses until they die, and if they are waiting, confine them to Allah.
And as for those among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, then punish them, and if they repent, then repent, and turn aside. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The repentance of those who repent (in Allah's Cause), and then repent (in Allah's Cause), then repent (in the Oneness of Allah (Allah)], and then repent (i.e. Allah's Religion (Islamic Monotheism), then Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise, All-Wise, etc.).
And the repentance of those who commit evil deeds, and when death comes to them, he says, “I repent,” and when they die, they are faithless. They have prepared a painful punishment.
O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit your wives, and it is not lawful for them, but if they are guilty of it, they may take it away from them, and do not kill them; and if you dislike them, they may dislike it. This is better for you.
And if you wish to replace one wife from another wife, and do not take one another with another, then take it back from it, and you have given you a clear calumny.
And how can you take it back, when ye have taken a covenant with you, and ye have taken a covenant with you?
And do not marry your wives whom your fathers married, except what is past. This is indecent and hateful, and an evil way.
He will not say to you and your spouses, and your wives, and the blood, and the blood, and the blood, and the blood, and the women, and the other, and the other, and you have not entered your backs, and you will not be able to do you.’ And when you do not go back to your homes, you will have your wives, and you will not be able to make your wives back to you, and you will not be able to make your wives back to you, and you will have a share of what you have done. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And do not marry the property of those who have been forbidden to you, except that which Allah has forbidden you. And do not kill them, except that which is forbidden to you, and that they may eat the property of the orphans, and that they should have a portion of what they have earned. And if ye have made a portion of what they have spent, you shall not be blamed. Lo! Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And those who do not believe in the cause of Allah, and the believing of women, and the believing of women, that they may be married and believing, and believing women, and they have no right to be married and believing women, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and they have no right, and do not repent, nor woman. And if you are patient, then verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Allah wishes to explain you to you, and to guide you to the ways of those before you. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.
And Allah will forgive you of His mercy and follow those who follow their desires, lest you are averse.
Allah wants to lighten your burden, and man was created weak.
O ye who believe! Eat not in the way of Allah, and devour not the goods of a near people, that ye may devour the property of your property. Lo! Allah is ever Merciful to you.
And whoever does not exceed the bounds of the bounds, We shall cast him into Hell, and that is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the sins of the people who have been forbidden, We will remove your sins, and admit you with a noble Entrance.
And do not covet what Allah has given some of you to excel others in the way of Allah. They have earned a share of what they have earned, and that they should earn a share of what they have earned, and ask Allah to His bounty. Indeed Allah has knowledge of everything.
And We have ordained for the parents, and for the needy, and to the relatives, and to give them a portion of what they have been related to them, and give them their due; and Allah is witness over everything.
Those of women who have passed away from among them, that they are not able to spend their wealth, and they are humble by Allah's burden, and they have no fear of Allah, and they are humble to their heart, and the right, and those who are humble to them; and do not kill them, and kill them. And if they turn back, then kill them, and beware of them. Lo! Allah is Able to do all.
And if you fear a breach between the two of them, and the wife from the two of them, and she arbiter between her, and if she set a reconciliation between them, Allah will reconcile between them; surely Allah is Knowing, Knowing.
And serve Allah, and do not associate anything with Him, and to parents, and to the needy, and to the needy, and to the neighbour, and to the neighbour, and to the neighbour, and to the neighbour, and to your neighbour, and to the traveller, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer; and be not your companion; indeed Allah does not love the proud.
Those who are niggardly and bid people to stinginess, and conceal what Allah has given them of His bounty; and We have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement.
And those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah, and do not believe in the Day of Resurrection, nor be he who is the companion of his companion. And woe to him as a friend.
And what was they for them, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day, and spent in what Allah has given them? And Allah is Aware of what they do.
Allah does not wrong injustice in the least, but if He does injustice, He doubles it and gives a great reward from Him.
How will it be when We bring a witness from every community, and We bring you as a witness against you?
On that Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth will not be levelled to them, and they will not be able to hide it.
O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are drunk, and when you are drunk, and do not be intoxicated, until you are travelling, and do not approach the needy, or when you are secure, or if you are needy, or if you are needy, or if you are secure. And if you are secure, you will find a clean sand-off, and your hands are a enemy, and that you may turn back from your feet, and know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Hast thou not seen those who were given the Book in the Book, purchasing error, and led you astray?
And Allah knows best your enemies; and Allah suffices as a protector and a helper.
Those who were given the Book to follow the way of the Jews and the Christians, and when they followed the way of their own people, they say, "If we are to follow it, they would be better than them." And when they are given to the right, they say, "This is better than us." And Allah has cursed them, so that they may have faith.
O you who have been given the Book! Believe in what We have sent down to you, confirming what is before you, and turn away from them, and do not turn back their faces, until they were seized by the curse of the Sabbath, and the command of Allah, and the command of all people.
Lo! Allah forgiveth not that partners should be ascribed with Him, and He forgives whom He will, and He forgiveth whom He is with a tremendous sin.
Hast thou not seen those who have taken themselves as a lie? They will be called to Allah, and He will not be able to make a evil-stone.
Look how they invent lies against Allah, and that is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book? They are called to the People of the Book and those who deny the truth and say, "These are the people who believe."
Those are they whom Allah has cursed, and he whom Allah curseth, you will not find any helper.
Or have they a share of the kingdom? If they are able to do so, they would not be able to give a single sesame.
Or do they envy the people which Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty? They have received the Book and wisdom, and gave him wisdom and wisdom.
Some of them believed in the Book, and some of them turn away from them; and Hell is sufficient for them.
Verily, those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), We have put them into the Fire, as often as the skins of those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah), so that they may taste the punishment. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and they shall be purified therein, and We shall admit them to plenteous shade.
Allah commands you to render your Trusts to your religion, and if you judge between you, judge between justice and justice. God is aware of all things.
O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and the Noble Messenger, and if you dispute between you, refer to your religion, and do not believe in the Day of Resurrection. And if you believe in Allah and His Messenger, it is better for you and a excellent outcome.
Hast thou not seen those who disbelieve that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was revealed to you, and they would not believe in that which they have been revealed to them, and they would be averse to it, and Satan hath led them astray.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," they turn away in aversion and turn away.
How will it be, when a disaster befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, and they would say, “This is what Allah has promised us, so that we could not have any good than goodwill?”
Those are in their hearts Allah knows that which is in their hearts, so turn them away and admonish them, and speak to them that they speak.
And We sent not any prophet except for him that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave. And if they had been wronged, they would have asked forgiveness and forgiveness for forgiveness. And if they had come to Allah and His forgiveness, they would have found for Allah a forgiveness and mercy.
But you will not believe in your Lord, that they may judge between them until they have been disputes between them, and then disputes between them, so that they may be pleased.
And if We had decreed unto them (O Muhammad SAW), that ye should be driven forth from your homes, they would not have done a few of them, nor would they have done a few of them. And if they had done it, they would have done it for it, and they would have been better.
And We shall have given them a great reward from Us.
And guided them to a straight path.
And those who obey Allah and His Messenger, those who are with those whom Allah has blessed, the Prophets, the righteous, the martyrs, and the righteous, and those who are righteous, they are the righteous.
This is the bounty of Allah, and Allah is aware of the things.
O you who have believed, take your precautions, and go forth in companies, or go forth.
Among you is he who lags behind, and if a calamity befalls you, they say, “If Allah has favored me, I would have been among them.”
And if a favor from Allah should be upon you, He would say to those who have been given friendship, “If only I could be able to be a single friend, I would have achieved a favour between me.’
So let not those who fight in the way of Allah for the life of this world and the Hereafter; and whosoever fights in Allah and the Last Day, He will surely grant him a great reward.
And what is the matter with you that you should fight in the way of Allah and the oppressed and those who are weak and children and women, who said, "Our Lord, bring us out of this town whose people are oppressors, and give us a protector from Yourself, and give us a helper from Yourself."
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Allah. So fight against the friends of Satan. Indeed, the craft of Satan is weak.
Hast thou not seen those who broke their hands in the way of their Lord, and when they were in the prayer, and they should be in the prayer, and when they were in a part of the people, and they should be in the prayer, and they would say, “Our Lord! If You give us a little, we will be satisfied.’ Say, ‘This is the life of this world, so that you may give us a little, and do not be the successful.”
Wheresoever you will find death, and even if you are able to find towers, and even if they are content with you, they say, "This is from Allah." But if a ill befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah." Say, "What is with Allah," and it is because they are a people who do not understand?
Whatever good happens to you is from Allah, and whatever misfortune befalls you, it is evil for you; and We have sent you as a apostle, and Allah suffices as a witness.
Those who obey the Messenger, and whoever obeys Allah, then verily, We have sent you over you as a watcher over them.
And they say, “We have come to you.’ But when they turn away from you, they say, “The night are conspiring.’ But when they conspire with the night, they say, “Keep your trust in Allah; and Allah suffices as a Trustee.’
Do they not ponder the Qur'an? Had it been from any other than Allah, they would surely have found much discrepancy in it.
And when there comes to them a glad tidings of safety, or they have not yet come to them, and they had referred to them the Book, and they had referred them the Book, and they had referred it to the Book, that they should not be able to do it. And if it had been for the grace of Allah and His mercy, He would have made you a few of a few of you.
So fight in the way of Allah, for you will not be able to do so. And rouse those who believe and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day. And Allah is stronger-Strong, All-powerful.
Whoever intercedes with a good cause shall have a share of his own burden, and whosoever intercedes with a evil cause shall have a share of his burden; and Allah has power over all things.
And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet with a better better than it, or return it to it. And Allah is full of all things.
Allah! There is no god but He. He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. And who is truer in statement than Allah?
What is the matter with you, that you may see the two parties in the two parties, and Allah has made their deeds manifest to you? Do you want to guide him whom Allah has guided? And Allah will not guide you whom you find for him a way.
They wish that you will disbelieve in the unbelievers, and they have not yet been friends. So do not befriend them, and do not befriend them until they emigrate in the way of Allah, and kill them wherever they turn back, and kill them wherever you find them, and do not find any supporter besides them.
Except for those who have taken a treaty between you and you who is a enemy between you, or a party of you who is a enemy to you, and they have not been left with you. Had Allah willed, He could have given you power over you, and they would have fought you. And if you obey them, they would have fought you. And if you obey them, they will have taken against you a way.
You will find you secure from your own people. And when they come to you, they will be driven away from them, and they will not be able to offer you back to them. And if they turn away from you, they do not kill you, nor kill them, and kill them wherever they restrain you. And kill them and kill them. We have made you clear authority.
And do not be a Muslim of the believers, the one who follows the truth, one who follows the way of Allah, the one who follows his faith, and the one who follows his faith, and believes in one another, and follows the one who follows his faith. And if one of the one who follows the truth, he finds it to be one another. And whoever fulfills the limits of Allah, it is worthy of it. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.
And whoever kills a believer and his sin will be admitted to Hell, and he will abide for him, and Allah has prepared for him a terrible punishment.
O you who believe! When you find the cause of Allah in the cause of Allah, investigate in it, and do not say to those who say, "You are not in the life of the world." But if you do not fight, you will say, "God has given you the life of this world, so that you may give you a great reward, and that Allah has favored you, so that you may investigate."
The believers are not equal to those who fight in Allah's way, and they strive with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah. Those who strive with their wealth with their wealth and strive with the cause of Allah. Such is the reward of those who strive with Allah, and Allah has preferred the reward of those who strive.
Degrees from their Lord and mercy, and Allah is forgiving and kind.
Indeed, those who did wrong, when the angels will say to those who were arrogant, "What were you that you were oppressed?" They will say, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say, "Was not Allah's earth to cause you to emigrate in the earth?" Their destination is Hell, and an evil destination.
Except for men and women who were oppressed, and who are not able to make a way to them, nor can they find a way.
God will forgive them. God is Pardoning and Forgiving.
Whoever emigrates in the way of Allah, He will cause refuge in the land, and He leaves his home to enter the land, and to his death, and to his death, and to his death. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And when you are journeying in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the punishment, and if you fear the punishment, that you may know that you are the enemies of the disbelievers.
And when they go back to you, then go back to them wherever you find them, and when you turn back to them, you may find your prayer, and you will not be able to prevent you from your heels. And if you attack you to the land, you would not be able to attack you. And if you do not desist, you would be able to remove it. And if you attack you to the command of Allah, it would be a great sin.
When you have finished the prayer, remember Allah, standing, sitting, and lying at your sides. When you are secure, perform the prayer, and perform the prayer.
And do not falter in the pursuit of the enemy. If you are suffering, you are suffering, and you are suffering, but Allah will not hope for you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Wise.
Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book (i.e. the Quran and the Quran), (Muhammad SAW) that you may judge between the people (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], so that you may judge between the people (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.). And do not be one of the treacherous.
And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And do not plead on behalf of those who betray themselves; surely Allah does not love the treacherous.
They hide the night, and they cannot hide from Allah; and when they hide the night, they cannot hide it by the night. And Allah encompasses what they do.

And whosoever commits sin, then he earns it against his own soul; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.

He has given you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know. Indeed, Allah is upon you a great bounty.
There is no fault in a thing in which is in the right, or that he should be followed by one another, or that he may be followed by one another. And whoever does good, We shall give him a great reward.
And whoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance has come to him, and follows the path of one another, and follows the path of a party of him, he will be admitted to Hell, and We shall make him enter Hell, an evil destination.
Allah does not forgive the sin of considering any partner to Him, and He forgives what He wills. Whoever ascribes partners to God has indeed strayed far astray.
Those whom they invoke besides Him, they call to Him, and invoke the devil,
He said, "Indeed, I will take a portion of Your servants to give you a portion of Your servants."
And I will lead them astray, and I will arouse them to slit the ears of them, and I will arouse them to slit the ears of cattle, and I will order them to alter the creation of Allah. And whoever turns astray instead of Allah, he is indeed a patron.
He promises them and arouses of them; and Satan promiseth them only delusion.
Their abode is Hell, and they will not be able to escape from it.
And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. This is the promise of Allah, and who is truer than Allah.
It is not your fancies nor the fancies of the People of the Book. Whoever commits evil will be requited for his evil deeds, and none will find no protector besides Allah.
And whoever does righteous works, whether male or female, and is a believer, he shall enter Paradise and shall not be wronged in the least.
And who is better in religion than he who submits his face to Allah, and follows the religion of Abraham, and follows the religion of Abraham, Abraham, Abraham?
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and Allah is Able to do all things.
They ask you concerning their women. Say: 'The knowledge has come to you concerning Allah, that you may not kill them, and do not kill you, and do not kill them, and kill you, and do not kill you, and do not give the lie to the orphans, and speak to them; and do good things, and do not be equitable.”
And if a woman fears her husband or desertion from her husband, they shall not be able to marry each other; and if they are two-doer, it is better for them. And if they are good, then be mindful of it; and Allah is aware of what you do.
And you will not be able to be able to do justice between your wives, and you will not be able to be able to do so. If you desire to do so, then incline to one another. And if you are conciliatory and Godwary, Allah is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
But if they separate, Allah will enrich them with His bounty, and Allah is all-bounteous, all-wise.
And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And indeed We have given you the Book and those who have been given the Book before you. And if you disbelieve, then know that Allah is the All-sufficient, the All-laudable.

O you who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Book, and the Book, and His angels, and His angels, and His Messengers, and the Last Day, and the Last Day, and the Last Day.
Those who believe, then disbelieve, then disbelieve, then disbelieve, then disbelieve, and then disbelieved, and then increase their disbelief, Allah will not forgive them.
Give glad tidings to the hypocrites that there awaits them a painful chastisement.
Those who take the disbelievers for friends instead of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism). Do they seek them with them? Verily! Allah's is the power of all things.
And Allah has sent down to you the Book (Muhammad SAW) in the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], (Muhammad SAW) (Muhammad SAW) and those who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). Do not sit with them until they engage in them, and do not sit with them. And if they turn away, then know that Allah will gather the hypocrites.
Those who are waiting with you. If a victory has come to you, they say: "Were we not with you?" But if the disbelievers had come to you, they will say: "Did we not say to you, "Have we not with you?" (Muhammad), say, "We have believed with you, and have no faith in Allah and the Day of Resurrection?" And Allah does not guide the disbelievers.
The hypocrites are only in the way of Allah. But when they are able to take up the prayer, they stand in prayer, and when they stand with prayer, they stand up to their Lord, and remember none but Allah.

Those are those who deny the truth and have prepared a humiliating punishment.
And those who believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not discriminate between any of them, for them shall be their reward; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The People of the Book ask you to bring down to you a Book from heaven. They said: "Show us Allah," they said: "Show us Allah." Then they took the calf after their wickedness, and they gave them clear proofs. Then, after the clear proofs, they took their calf after clear proofs.

We have sent inspiration to you (O Muhammad SAW), as We inspired Noah (Noah), and the Prophets (Noah), and Noah (Noah), and Noah (Noah), and Jacob (Job), and Jacob (Job), and Jacob (Job), and Job (Job), and Job (Job), and Harun (Job), and Harun (Job), and Harun (Job), and Harun (Job), and Harun (Aaron), and the Psalms.

So do not follow the ways of those who have been given to you.

That Allah may guide those who seek the pleasure of Allah, and He brings them out of darkness into the light, and guides them with the light of light, and guides them to the Straight Path.
Those who disbelieve say: "Allah is Christ, son of Mary." Say: "Who is the kingdom of Allah?" Say: "Who is more than Allah, Who is the Messiah, son of Mary, the son of Mary, the son of Mary, and the earth, and all that is between them and all that is between them? He creates all that He wills, and He has power over all things."
The Jews and the Christians say: "We are the children of Allah and His beloved children." Say: "Why does He punish you from your sins?" Say: "If your sins is only He Who created you, and He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to Him you will be returned."
O People of the Book! We have sent you to a Messenger to come to you in the Book, that you may say to the people, "Do not give us glad tidings, nor come to us. You have come to you glad tidings of glad tidings and give glad tidings to you. God has power over all things."
And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: "O my people, remember Allah's Favour upon you when He made you kings and made you kings, and gave you kings, and He made you not be among the worlds.
O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah has ordained for you, and turn not back to your backs, and ye will be losers.
They said: "O Moses! There is a tyrannical race in the land, and we shall not enter it until they leave it, and leave it, if they are victorious."
Two one of whom Allah has favoured the two of them, who said: "Enter the gate," and when they enter the gate, it will be said to them, "Enter the gate, if you are believers."
They said: "O Moses, we shall not enter it, but we will enter it, and leave your Lord, and fight, and we shall be sitting."
He said: My Lord! I have no power over myself and my brother, so decide between us and the people of the ungodly.
He said: "In the land, they shall wander in the land, and wander in distraction. Do not be afraid of the people of the people."
And recite thou unto them the tale of the two sons of Adam, when one of them offered a calf, and when it became accepted from them, they will not be accepted from it, and they said: "O ilaha Lord!" (The disbelievers) said: "O my people! Verily! I fear (the truth), and fear Allah."
If you do not kill me, I will not extend your hand to kill you. Indeed, I fear God, the Lord of the Universe.
I will forgive you your sins and your sin, and you will be among the inmates of the Fire."
Then his soul prompted him to kill his brother, and he killed him and became one of the losers.
Then Allah sent down a raven to show the earth to show his brother in the earth. He said to his brother, "Woe to me! Am I unable to bury this crow, that I could bury the corpse of my brother?" He said, "I have lost my brother and became one of the remorseful."
That was how We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills the earth to take corruption in the land, nor would he be slain for mankind. And if he saves them, he will be as if he had slain all mankind. And the messengers came to them with clear proofs, but many of them continued to commit excesses.
The reward of those who strive with Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the land for the cause of the persecution of the earth, or crucified, or crucified, or crucified, or crucified, and cut off their hands in the land, shall be in the land. Such is the punishment of the Hereafter.
Save those who repent before you before them, and know that Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah and seek His pleasure, and strive in that which ye have been working.
Verily, those who disbelieve, if they are in the earth, and that which is in the earth, and if it be on the torment of the Day of Resurrection, they would not ransom it from it. Theirs will be a painful torment.
They will wish to get out of it, and they will not be able to return to it, and theirs will be a lasting punishment.
And the thief and his wife will be cut off for their evil-doing, so that they may be punished by Allah's punishment. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise.
But he who repents and does righteous deeds, then turns to his Lord, verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do you not know that Allah is the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills, and Allah has power over all things.
O you who have believed, do not be grieved to those who have faith in their hearts, and they say, "We believe in what they have been doing." Say, "Do not say to those who have faith, and they have not yet entered it." Say, "It is only for your own souls. You do not change what Allah has given to you, and they do not change what Allah has provided for you. They are more than that which He has not given to you, and they would have a great punishment in this world and in the life of this world. They will have a painful punishment in the Hereafter.
Listeners lies to the distribution of the unlawful. If they come to you, judge between them and turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they will not harm you. But if you judge, judge between them and judge between them. God loves the equitable.
And how can they have come to you (O Muhammad SAW), when they have received the Taurat (Torah) and the Gospel (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] has been sent down to you (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and the Taurat (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] has come to them (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)]. But they are believers.
We have sent down the Book for the people of the Book and the light of the Book and the Jews and the rabbis and the rabbis, and the rabbis, and the rabbis, and the rabbis, and the rabbis, and their rabbis, and they were witnesses to it. So fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a small price; and do not sell My revelations for a small price. Those who do not believe in My revelations are the unbelievers.
And We had decreed for them the Book, for a life for a eye, a nose for a nose, a nose for a nose, a nose for a nose, a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and if a wound is a wound for him, then whosoever forgoes it with Allah, it is for him that he may be unjust. And Allah does not wrong the wrong-doers.
And We sent unto them the son of Mary, with the footsteps of Abraham, confirming that which was before him, confirming that which was before him, and We gave him the Gospel, and guidance, and guidance, and guidance, and a guidance, and a guidance and a admonition for those who believe.
And judge in what Allah has sent down to the People of the Book, that they may judge with what Allah has sent down. And those who do not judge with what Allah has sent down to the believers.
And We have revealed to you the Book of the Book, confirming the Torah and the Gospel, confirming that which is revealed to you, and to follow the desires of you, and follow their desires. And if you do not follow the desires of the people, you would not have done it. And if you do not return to it, you will have been able to return to it. Then you will return to Allah's favours, and He will inform you of what you have done, and He will inform you of what you used to differ.
And judge between them with what Allah has sent down, and follow not their desires, lest they turn away from them, and do not follow their desires, lest they turn away from you. But if they turn away, then know that Allah's punishment may afflict them for some of them, but most of them are transgressors.
Is it the judgement of the judgment of the judgment of Allah? What is the judgement for those who believe.
O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are allies of one another. And whoever follows you, then verily, Allah does not guide the unjust.
And they see those in whose hearts is a disease, and they say: "We fear lest we may be afraid or afraid." Say, "Perhaps Allah may bring us victory or a victory against us, that they may be remorseful in what they have been concealing."
And those who believe will say: "What is the matter with Allah that they swore against you by Allah?" They will have lost their deeds, and they will be losers.
O you who believe! When you turn back from the way of Allah, He will surely raise him to those who believe, for they love the way of Allah, and who strive hard in the way of Allah, and strive hard in the way of Allah, and strive hard in the way of Allah. And Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
Those who believe and obey Allah and His Messenger, and those who establish the prayer and pay the zakat, and bow down.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger, and the faithful, and those who have believed, verily Allah is the host of the worlds.
O you who have believed! Do not take up those who have been given the Book before you and those who were before you, and do not be like those who have been given the Book. And fear Allah, and fear Allah.
And when you call to prayer, they listen to it, and do not sport. That is because they are a people who do not understand.
Say: "O People of the Book! Why do you resent us for us, except that Allah has sent down to us what has been sent down to us, and that which has been revealed to us?" And most of you are believers.
Say: "Shall I inform you of what is worse for you than Allah? Those whom Allah has cursed, the curse of those whom He has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and whom He has made apes and swine, and those who have turned astray, are worse in the sight of Allah and the Straight Path."
When they come to you, they say: "We believe," and when they come to disbelief, they will disbelieve in it. And Allah knows what they hide.
And you see many of them hastening in sin and transgression, and consuming what is forbidden, and evil is what they used to do.
Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of the doctors of Allah and the rabbis and the unlawful, and what they used to do?
And the saying and the Christians said: "Allah has sent down to you a son (i.e. the children of the children of the Jews and the children of the children of the polytheists), and He has sent it back to the people on the Day of Resurrection. And to the Day of Resurrection, that they may turn up in the way of Allah and the Day of Resurrection. And when you have turned up to the Day of Resurrection, the Fire will be the enemies of the Fire, and Allah will make it up to the disbelievers. And Allah does not love the arrogant."
And if the People of the Book had believed and been godfearing, We would surely have admitted them their sins and admitted them into Gardens of bliss.
And if they had followed the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have consumed from their feet and from beneath their feet. Among them is a moderate community, but many of them are evil.
O Prophet! Follow the Book which has been sent down to you from your Lord. But if they do not desist, they would not have been conveyed to you. And if they have been conveyed to you, Allah will surely protect you from His people. Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book, you are not in the religion of the Book and the Taurat and the Gospel which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And what has been sent down to you from your Lord is that which has been sent down to you from your Lord. So do not be like the people of people who disbelieved and do not believe.
Those who believe, and the Jews and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and believes in Allah and the Last Day, will not be saddened nor shall they grieve.
And We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and sent them messengers from the people, and they came to them with their mouths, but they slew him, and they slew him.
They thought that they would be blind, and blind, and blind. But if they return to their Lord, they turned blind and deaf. And Allah is aware of what they do.
Indeed, those who disbelieve said, “O Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, son of Mary.’ The Messiah said, ‘O my people, serve Allah, your Lord and your Lord.’ And whoever ascribes partners to Allah, He will surely make the abode of the two-beneficent; and Allah is the Protector of those who do not associate with Him, and indeed the wrongdoers will be unjust.
Those who say: "Allah is the third (i.e. the Most Beneficent (Allah)."
Will they not then repent to Allah and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The Messiah son of Mary, son of Mary, was a messenger before him, and before him, and his mother, before him, and his mother. How they ate food, so how We make them clear proofs. Look, how they are deluded.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which is not for you any harm or profit you? And Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book, do not exceed the bounds of your religion, and do not follow the desires of those who have gone astray before, and misled many people, and follow the Straight Path."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. They were the people of the truth, and because they were defiantly disobedient.
They did not prevent one another from what they used to do. Evil is what they used to do.
You see many of them fraternizing in the path of those who disbelieve. That is what they have been sent with. They will have the wrath of their Lord, and they will live forever.
And if they had believed in Allah and His Messenger, and that which was sent down to him, they would not have helped them. But many of them are transgressors.
You will find the Jews and the idolaters for those who believe in you, and you will see those who say, ‘We are Christians,’ and the Christians are those who say, “We are Christians,’ and the Christians are in their hearts, and they are not proud.
And when they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, they will recognize you with their eyes overflowing with tears. They say, “Our Lord, we believe in what we have been sent, and we are among our witnesses.”
Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? Our Lord, admit us out of the righteous.
But Allah will reward them for their saying, Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the reward of those who do good.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).
O you who believe! do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like the transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has provided for you, lawful and good, and fear Allah, if you are believers.
Allah will not forgive you with your oaths, and He will remove your hearts with your property, and He will not reach the two-camel, or He will not reach your two people. When you reach a agreement, it will be three than that which He has given you, and you will not be able to hide it by your oaths. This is what your oaths has enjoined upon you by your oaths, so that you may take your oaths by Allah’s commands, so that you may remember.
O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling and gambling, and the divining arrows are enemies to you. Avoid the abomination of Satan, so that you may prosper.
It is only for you that you should take enmity and hatred from the Sacred Mosque, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and the remembrance of the people, and do not turn back from the remembrance of Allah, so that you may return.
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and beware. But if you turn away, then know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the message.
As for those who believe and do good works, that they should not be wronged, and do not believe in the believers, and do righteous deeds, and believe in Allah and do good deeds; and Allah loves those who believe and do good deeds; and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! Allah will not try you to enter your hands by the game of the game of that which Allah has given you. And whoever fears Allah, he will surely have a painful punishment.
O you who believe! When you are journeying in the land, you will not be able to die in the life of the land, and do not make the way of the desert, unless you have bathed, unless they have bathed. And do not make the bequest for the needy, unless he is one of the people, unless he should be one of his own soul. And whoever transgresses and does good, he will be in his hands. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Powerful.
Lawful to you is the game of the sea and the food of the game of the sea. And for you is the game of the game of the land and the game of the land. And fear Allah, and be careful of (your duty to) Him, and to Him you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah (the Ka'bah), the Sacred House, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, and the animals (the Ka'bah (Makkah)], and the skins (of the Ka'bah (Makkah)], that they may know (the land), and know that which is in the heavens and the earth. Verily, Allah is Knower of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
It is only a duty to the people of the message, and Allah knows what you disclose and what you hide.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The bad and the good are not equal to the bad (i.e. the best (Gospel)], and do not follow the bad (i.e. the best (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel)]. So fear Allah, and fear that you may be successful."
O you who believe! Do not ask about things which is revealed to you, and if they ask you about the Qur'an, they will not be able to ask you. But if you ask about them, they will be disclosed to you. God is Forgiving and Forbearing.
The people of your people had come to you, so that they disbelieved.
Allah has not appointed for you a bahirah or sa'ibah, or wasilah or ham, as a example for those who disbelieve. But most of them do not know.
And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has sent down, and the Messenger," they say: "Enough to us our fathers," and they say: "Enough to us!" Even though their fathers had no guidance?
O you who have believed, do not go back to your own souls. If you are rightly guided, He will surely make you go astray, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who have believed, if you are driven back to a journey, a group of the two women has come to you. And if you are in the land, you will not be able to drive you back to the people, unless you are in the land. And if they go back, then say, "We shall not be able to take up a near relatives." And when a group of the people who say, Allah will say, "Let the testimony of the two-doers."
And if it is said to them, the guilty among them and those who are behind them, are two than them, saying: "Our testimony, our testimony is truer than the testimony of our testimony, and we are truer than our testimony, and we should not be unjust."
That is because they will not be able to hide the testimony of their oaths, or that they may return to their oaths; and fear Allah, and listen to the truth; and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
On the Day when He will gather them together, and say, “What response did you say?” They will say, ‘We have not heard what we have done. You are indeed the Knower of all things.”
And when We said to the son of Mary, “O my son, I will give you the interpretation of the king and the Torah, and I commanded you to be the leader of the Descendants of Israel, and I commanded him to be the first of the House.’ And when the Disciples came to you, he said, ‘Take the way of the House,” and when the people came to you, he said, “I will not be able to take the calf.” And when the people came to you with a clear sign, the disbelievers said, “I have been sent to you with a clear sign.’ And the disbelievers took to you a clear sign.
And when I inspired the disciples with the disciples, they said, “We believe, and believe in My Messenger.’ They said, ‘We believe, and bear witness that we are Muslims.”
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, has your Lord sent down to us a table from heaven?" He said, "Fear Allah, if you are believers."
They said: "We wish that we may eat from our hearts, and that our hearts may be reassured, and that we may be witnesses."
Jesus son of Mary said, “O our Lord, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven, so that we may be a festival from us, and the last of us, and the last of us, and a sign for us, and give us sustenance, for You are the best of providers.”
Allah said: "I will send it down to you, but if you turn away, I will punish you with a punishment with whom I will not chastise any one of the worlds."
And when Allah said to his son, “O Jesus, I have chosen the son of Mary, who will be my helpers.’ Say, ‘Do you not say, ‘‘I am my helpers?’ Say, ‘My Lord, You do not be able to be able to be able to be able to do it, and I do not know what you have done. Indeed, I know what you do, and I know what you do.”
You spake to kill me, except that I commanded me to worship Allah, and your Lord, and your Lord, and I have made them a long of them, and I have made them a long time, and I have made them a barrier over them, and You are Witness over You.
If You punish them, they are Your servants; and if You forgive them, You are the Almighty, the Wise.
Allah will say: 'This is the Day of which the truthful will be on the truthful, and they will be abiders in it. That is the Gardens that they will be abiders in the Gardens of which rivers flow, and Allah is pleased with them. That is the supreme triumph.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He has power over all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the sun and the moon, and they are among those who ascribe equals to Him.
It is He who created you from dust, then appointed a term for you, and He has appointed a term for you, that you are truthful.
He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you hide and what you disclose. And He knows what you do.
And there comes to them a sign from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
But they denied the truth when it came to them, so that they may come to know.
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them? We established them in the land, which We had established for you, and We sent down upon them abundant rains from the sky, and We sent down upon them abundant rains from the sky. Then We destroyed them for their sins, and raised up another generation.
And if We had sent down to you a Book in parchment, they would have touched them with their hands, and they would say: "This is nothing but plain magic."
And they say, “Why has not a angel been sent down to him?” If We sent down a angel, the matter would have been decided, and they would not be reprieved.
And had We sent him an angel, he would have made him a man, and We would have made them confusion in it.
And before you were mocked before you, but those who mocked before them were besieged by what they used to deride.
Say, ‘Travel in the land, and see how was the end of the deniers.’
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To Allah." Say: "To Allah is He Who has sent mercy on Himself, and He will not gather you on the Day of Resurrection, and they will not believe."
And to Him belongs all that dwells in the night and the day. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Shall I seek a protector other than Allah, Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He gives you the sustenance, and He gives you the sustenance of the heavens and the earth.’ Say, ‘I have been commanded to be of those who submit to Allah, and do not be among the polytheists.”
Say: "If I fear, if the punishment of my Lord should be on the torment of a tremendous Day,
On that Day, on that Day will be the punishment of Allah, and that is the manifest triumph.
And if Allah touch you with affliction, none can remove it but He; and if He touches you with good, He is Able to do all things.
He is the Irresistible, the Aware, the Wise.
Say, "I have been forbidden to be a witness between you and you." Say, "I have been revealed to you and what is revealed to me." Say, "I have been revealed to you that God has revealed the Book to you, and has not set down the like of it. Say, "Do not be a god besides Allah. I call only to worship God, and I am not of those who associate (with Him)."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognise him as they recognize their own sons. Those who do not believe in their own souls.
And who is more unjust than he who invents lies against Allah, or denies His revelations? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.
And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, We will say to those who ascribed partners to Us, "Where are your partners whom you used to claim?"
Then they will not be able to say, "Our Lord, we have been commanded to be worshipped by our Lord,
Look how they lie against the lie against them, and that which they used to invent lies!
And of them there are some who listen to you, but We have placed veils over their hearts, so that they may understand their ears, and deafness in their ears; and if they see the clear signs, they would not believe in it. And when they come to you, they say, “This is nothing but myths of the people who have come to you.’ But the disbelievers say, “This is nothing but myths of the ancients.”
And they prevent others from it, and they turn away from it, and they are not aware.
And when you see it, they will be awake, and they will say, “Alas! Would that we had been sent back to us, and we would be among the faithful.”
Nay, but they have lost the truth that they had come to them. And if they were returned to it, they would return to it, and they are liars.
And they say, “There is nothing but our life of this world, and we will not be resurrected.”
Then, when they see the Day of Judgment, they will be brought back to their Lord. They will say: "Is this not real?" They will say: "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say: "Then taste what you used to deny."
Those who deny the meeting with Allah in the meeting when the Hour comes to them suddenly, they will say, "Alas on us!" When the Hour comes upon them suddenly, they will bear their burden on their backs. Woe to what they have been doing!
The life of this world is nothing but sport and amusement. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who do not believe. Will you not then take heed?
We know what they say grieves you, and they do not grieve it; and the signs of Allah are signs.
And indeed before you were messengers before you, and they were patient until they were patient, and when they were patient, there is no change for them. And none can alter the words of Allah before the messengers.
And if they turn away from the earth, they will not be able to seek a tunnel into the earth, or a ladder from the sky. If He had willed, He would have made them a sign. And if He willed, He would have guided them, and do not be of the ignorant.
Only those who listen listen to the truth. But Allah will raise the dead, and then to Him they will be returned.
And they say: "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Verily, Allah is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know."
And there is no animal on the earth that moves on the earth, nor has its wings over its wings. And there are a Book in the Book, and to their Lord they will be mustered.
Those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) are deaf and deaf. And Allah sends astray on whom He wills, and guides whom He wills.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah come upon you, or the Hour of the Hour (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), will you come to you from Allah, if you are truthful?
Nay, but, if you call upon Him, He will remove it, but if He wills, He will remove that which you associate with Him.
We sent messengers to nations before you, so We seized them with misery and hardship, so that they might humble themselves.
Then why did they not entreat when Our punishment came to them? But their hearts became hardened, and their hearts became hardened.
And when they forgot what they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of all things, and they rejoiced in what they had been given, and We seized them with despair while they were despondent.
So the last remnant of the people who were destroyed, and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.
Say, ‘Have you considered, if Allah has sealed your hearing and your hearing and your hearts, and sealed your hearts?” Look, how We paraphrase the signs, how they turn away.
Say: "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah come upon you, or the punishment of the Hour, will then be destroyed?"
And We sent not the messengers as a bearer of glad tidings and glad tidings. And those who believe and do good deeds, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) for them (i.e. the punishment of Allah and His Messengers, etc.), for their denial of the torment (i.e. the torment of Allah and His Messenger, etc.).
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)], and I am not an angel." Say: "I do not know what I have revealed to me. I follow only what is revealed to me." Say: "Are the blind and the seeing alike? Will you not then reflect?"
And warn thou that which is in the hearts of those who fear their Lord, that there is no protector for them, and fear Allah, and they fear not.
And do not drive up those who call to their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Face. Do not be responsible for their account, nor do you accountable for them, and do not turn away from them, and you will be among the losers.
And similarly We have made some of them some of others, and they say: "Is there the one whom Allah has favoured with His Mercy?" Does not Allah know best those who are grateful?
And when those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say, “Peace be upon you, your Lord is your Lord, and He has a mercy for you, so that you may commit a evil of ignorance, then repent and amend. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.’
Thus do We explain Our signs to the people who do wrong.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O people, I call to you from the worship of Allah.’ Say, ‘I do not follow your desires, and I will not follow your desires, and I would be rightly guided.’
Say, "I have come to you from clear evidence from my Lord, and you have no doubt for what you have been promised, and I have no power to wait for you. He is the Best of the truth, and He is the best of deciders."
Say, "If I wish to hasten, I would have been settled between you and you. God knows best the unjust."
With Him are the keys of the unseen. He knows what is in the land. He knows what is in the land, and He knows what is in the land, and there is no darkness in the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the earth, nor is there any one in the darkness of the grain.
And He it is Who causeth you to enter the night, and He knoweth what is in the day, and He raises you to the day that ye may be appointed. Then unto Him is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
And He is the All-Mighty of His slaves, and He sends guardians over you, until when death approaches you, then one of you die and death, and they were not neglectful.
Then they are returned to Allah, their True Master, and He is the swiftest of reckoners.
Say: "Who saves you from the darkness of the land and sea, and when you call upon the darkness of the darkness of the land, when you call to us, we would surely be grateful?"
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah saves you from all of you, and He saves you from all of you, but you ascribe partners to Him."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "He has forbidden you to you from your feet from above you or from beneath your feet, or to divide you into the midst of your feet, and make you taste the violence of others. Thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)."
And your people have denied it, but it is the truth, and say: "I am not responsible for you."
For every prophecy is a appointed time, and you will come to know.
And when you see those who are engaged in Our revelations, they turn away from you, and do not turn away from them, until they turn away from you, and do not sit in the recollection with the unjust.
And those who do not believe in Allah's account are only for them, so that they may be cautious.
And let the example of those who follow the truth are the amusement, and the sport, and the sport, and the sport, and those who are with them. They will not be able to protect them against Allah, and they will not be able to change it. They will have made it as a great thing, and they will have a share of what they have done.
Say: "Show us us whom Allah should save us from whom we have not been guided to us, and we have not been able to turn back to us." Have they not then come to us from the way of Allah?" They will say, "It is only Allah who has guided us to the right path." Say, "It is Allah who guided us to guidance, and follow the path of our fathers, so that we may submit to the right path."
And to establish prayer and fear Him. And to Him you will be gathered.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth with truth. He says, ‘Be true!’ His word is the truth, and the Day when the trumpet will be blown, and the Day when the trumpet will be blown. The Knower of the unseen and the witnessed. He is the Wise, the Wise.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, “Do you take idols for gods? Indeed I see you and your people in manifest error.”
And We showed him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who believe.
When the night covered him, he beheld a star. He said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "I do not love the setting."
Then when he beheld the moon uprise, he said: This is my Lord. Then when it set, he said: "If my Lord has not guided me, I will surely be of the erring people."
Then when he beheld the sun uprise, he said, “This is my Lord; this is bigger.’ But when it set, he said, ‘O my people, I am indeed quit of what you associate with Allah.”
I have turned my face towards the One Who has created the heavens and the earth. I am not one of the polytheists."
And his people disputed with him. He said: "Do you argue with me concerning Allah, when He has guided me to the Right Path? And I do not fear those whom you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. Will you not take heed?
And do you fear what you associate with Allah, and do not fear Him with which He has sent down to you a authority? What is the matter with you? Do you then believe in the right path?
Those who believe and do not believe, and have faith in their faith. These are the guided.
This is Our argument which We gave to Abraham from his people. We chose them with degrees. Indeed, your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya'qub (Jacob) and Ya'qub (Jacob) and his progeny. And We gave them (Noah) and Harun (Moses), and Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), and Musa (Moses), and Harun (Aaron), and Harun (Aaron), and Harun (Aaron), and Harun (Aaron), and Harun (Aaron), and Harun (Aaron), and Harun (Aaron).
And Zechariah and John and Jesus and Jesus and Elias.
And Isma'il (Ishmael) and Al-Yas'il (Elisha) and Yunus (Lot), and Lout (Lot), and Lout (Lot), and all of them (Lout (Lot)].
And of their fathers and their descendants and their brethren, and We chose them and guided them to a straight path.
This is the guidance of Allah, He guides whom He wills. And if He wills, they would have done what they have done.
Those are they whom We gave the Book and wisdom, and prophethood, but if they believe in it, they believe in it, and disbelieve in it.
Those are they whom Allah has guided, and follow their guidance. Say: 'I ask for you no wage for it; it is only a reminder for all beings.'
And they did not say, “What has Allah not sent down to you a Book from which He has sent down the Book?’ Say, ‘Do you not know what Allah has sent down to Moses, and what has been sent down to you?” And when you have seen the knowledge, know what you did not know, and they would follow their own desires.
And this is a Book which We have sent down to you, confirming what is before it, confirming that which is before it and that which is in the Mother of Cities, and those who believe in it, and those who believe in it and do not believe.
And who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah, or he has been sent down to me? Say, ‘Do not be like me?’ If the Qur'an is sent down to me, they would not be able to stand in it. And when the angels had been sent down to you, they will be told with you, and the punishment of your Lord. So the punishment of a painful punishment should befall you, and you denied the signs of Allah.
And you have come to us a single revelation of which We have created you, and We have not given you what We have given you to you, and you will not be able to help you with what We have given you, and you will see what you used to associate with Allah, and that you were truthful in it.
It is Allah who splits the grain and the seed, and brings forth the living from the dead, and He brings forth the dead from the living. Such is Allah, so how are you deluded?
It is He who breaks the dawn, and causes the night for the day, and He has appointed the sun and the moon for a appointed term. Such is the ordaining of the Almighty, the Knowing.
And it is He who has made the stars subservient to you, that you may guide them by the darkness of the land and the sea, and We have distinguished the signs for a people who understand.
And it is He who has created you from a single soul, and made a lodging between you, and a repository and a repository. We have indeed spelled Our signs for a people who understand.
It is He who sends down water from the sky, and We produce for them grains from the earth, and therewith We bring forth from it grains from every kind of corn, and olives and pomegranates, and olives, and pomegranates, and different clusters of diverse hues, and they eat its fruit, and ripen and ripen. In this are signs for those who believe.
And they have attributed to Allah that which He has created for them, and He has created them, and He has created for them sons and daughters. Hallowed be He, exalted above what they associate with Him.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, how can He have a son when He has no consort? He has created everything, and He has knowledge of everything.
Such is the Lord of your Lord, there is no god but He. He is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian over all things.
No eyes can grasp Him, and He sees all eyes. He is the Subtle, the Expert.
Indeed, your Lord has come to you from your Lord. So whoever does good, it will be for his own soul. So whoever does good, it will be for his own soul, and I am not responsible over you.
Thus do We explain the signs for them, that they may say: 'You have studied.' And We have given you the Qur'an that they may understand.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He. So turn away from the polytheists.
Had Allah willed, they would not have ascribed partners to Him. We have not made you any guardian over them, and you will not have any guardian over them.
And do not insult those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they insult the limits of Allah. Thus We have made the example of people of their deeds. And to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swear by Allah by their oaths that if a sign came to them, they would say to those who believe, “What are the signs of Allah?’ But if a sign came to them, they will know that they would not believe.
And We turned upon their hearts and their hearts, and they were not to believe in it, and We will leave them in their rebellion.
And had We sent down upon them the angels and the dead, and We gathered unto them the dead and the dead, they would not have remained in it, but they would not believe in Allah, but most of them are ignorant.
And thus We have sent forth to every prophet a enemy from every nation and a enemy from among the people of jinn and jinn, inspiring one another. If your Lord had willed, they would not have done it. So leave them with their fabrications.
And those who do not believe in the Hereafter, that they may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with it and that which they may earn.
Say: "Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, that He has revealed to you the Book?" Those who have been given the Book know that which is revealed to you from your Lord. Say, "The truth has come to you from your Lord, and do not follow the truth."
And the Word of your Lord is perfected by truth and justice. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
And if you obey those who are in the earth, they would lead you astray from the path of Allah. They follow nothing but conjectures and surmise.
Your Lord knows best those who stray from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
So eat of that which Allah has given you of His revelations, that you may be of the believers.
And what is the matter with you that you do not eat in the name of Allah, that He has forbidden you to the people of which He has forbidden you? But you are compelled to necessity in ignorance. But your Lord knows best the transgressors.
And keep up the secret of sin and sin, and do not commit sin for what they used to earn.
And do not eat that the name of Allah has not been mentioned for you. This is a transgression and a man that is forbidden to you. But if you obey them, you will surely obey you, and you are disbelievers.
Is he who was dead, and We gave him life, and made for him one of the people who walks in the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the light? Such is the likeness of those who reject the truth, so that they may be successful.
And thus We have set forth a city (of the city) in the city (i.e. the people of the town (i.e. the Quran), that they may plot themselves (i.e. the wicked (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and they do not realize that they may be wronged.
And when a sign came to them, they say: "We believe not until we have been given to us. And we have not been given to Allah's revelations that Allah will cause the way of His messengers. Humiliation in Allah's punishment, a severe punishment.
And Allah guides whom He wills to Islam, and He causes him to whom He wills, and He makes his breast narrow to whomsoever He wills. And Allah lays the abomination for those who believe not.
This is the straight path of your Lord. We have detailed Our revelations for a people who have faith.
For them is their abode from their Lord, and He is the Protector of what they used to do.
And on the day when He will gather them all together, “O people of jinn! You will separate you into the worst of the jinn.” They will say, ‘Our Lord, we have given us a term, so that we may have forgotten our term.’ And the time of your Lord has been decreed, so that you may say, “This is what you used to do.” And Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Thus do We make those who are unjust to the wrong-doers that they may be doing.
O assembly of jinn and mankind! Did there come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of the Day of Resurrection? They will say, “We bear witness against ourselves, and we will bear witness against you.” They will bear witness against themselves, and they were faithless.
This is because your Lord would not destroy the cities unjustly while their people were unaware.
For all are degrees according to what they have done, and your Lord is not unaware of what you do.
And your Lord is the Self-sufficient, the All-merciful. If He wills, He will take you back to you, and He will replace you with the best of His mercy, and He has created you from the other people.
Indeed, that which you are promised will come to pass, and you cannot escape.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Work according to your ability, and I am acting. Soon you will know who will be the sequel of the Hereafter. Verily, the wrongdoers will not succeed."
And they assign the sustenance of Allah for the cattle, and He has created for them a portion of the cattle, and they say: "This is our intercessors," and say, "Our partners is only for Allah." But what is with Allah is nearer to what they say, and what is in our hands reaches Allah, and what they attribute to Him!
And that they took to the idolaters their religion, that they should lead them to their religion, and confound them to their religion, and confound them to their religion. So if they had willed, they would not have done them. So leave them with their forging.
And they say: "These animals and crops are forbidden." They have no share to eat them." Say, "We have forbidden the cattle, and they are forbidden to eat." They are forbidden to pronounce the name of Allah, and do not pronounce the name of Allah. He will soon requite them for what they used to invent.
And they say: "What is in the wombs of our cattle is that which is forbidden to our males and forbidden to our wives." But if they are born, He will punish them for their attribution. He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
Those who have lost their children in folly, and do not know what Allah has provided for them. Those who invent lies against Allah and do not have the right path.
It is He who produces gardens, trellised and untrellised, and date-palms, and crops and crops, and olives and pomegranates, and the olive and the pomegranate, so that they may eat its fruit, and eat its fruit, and do not be excessive. Indeed, He does not love the wasteful.
And of the cattle We have appointed for you a beast which is lawful for you, and of the sustenance of Allah, and follow not the footsteps of Satan. Lo! he is a open enemy to you.
Eight couples of sheep, and of the goats. Say: 'Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or that the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me, if you speak the truth, if you speak the truth.'
And of the camels We have created a pair of the twain. Say: 'Has you forbidden the two males or the females, or that the wombs of the two females contain? Or did you say that Allah has forbidden the two females?' But who is more unjust than he who fabricates a lie against Allah? But Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Say: "I have not been forbidden to be forbidden to eat of that which is revealed to me, except that it may eat the flesh of swine, or the flesh of swine, or the flesh of swine, or that which is forbidden to be slaughtered by the name of Allah. But if any one is forced by necessity or transgressing (to Him), it is no sin for him. And your Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
And for those who were Jews and claws We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep, except what adheres to their backs, or what adheres to their backs, or their entrails, and their entrails, and their entrails, and their rebellion, for their rebellion. We are indeed truthful.
But if they deny you, then say, “Your Lord is the possessor of His mercy, and His punishment will not be averted.”
The polytheists will say, “Had Allah wished, we would not have ascribed partners to Him, nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything, nor would we have forbidden anything.’ Those before them said, “Do not bring us any proof, except what you have brought us to us.” They will say, “You are only only conjectures, and you are only guessing.”
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Had Allah wished, He would have given you a Book, and He would have guided you all.”
Say: 'Bring your witnesses witnesses that Allah will witness you, and do not bear witness with them; and do not follow the truth, and do not follow the desires of those who deny Our signs, and those who do not believe in their Lord and those who are with them.
Say: 'Call your wives to your wives that I have forbidden you to be your parents, and do not give your parents to your parents, and do not take your parents to the other, and do not take your parents, and do not take the burden of the burden of his own soul; and do not prevent you with the way of Allah, and take the bounds to you. This is the law of Allah, which you do not know.”
And do not approach the property of the orphan with a near manner, until he reaches maturity, and give full measure and weight in justice. And do not speak to one another, until he reaches you, and do not speak to one another. And if you speak, We shall fulfil the covenant between you, and fulfil the covenant of your covenant; and remember Allah, so that you may remember.
And this is the path of the straight path, so follow it, and do not follow it, lest they follow you, and follow the path of your Lord. That is how He has enjoined upon you what you may be doing.
Then We gave Musa (Moses) the Book (Moses), that he might be one of those who had given the Book (Moses), and a detailed explanation of all things, and a guidance and mercy for those who believe.
This is a Book which We have sent down, so follow it, and be wary of it, so that you may receive mercy.
Lest you say, “The Book has been sent down to us before the two groups before us, and we were unaware of it.”
Or lest you should say, "Had the Book been sent down to us, we would have been better guided than they." But a guidance has come to you from your Lord, and guidance, and guidance. And who is more unjust than he who denies the signs of Allah, and turns away from them? So We will recompense the punishment of a painful punishment for a people who turn away from Our signs.
Are they waiting for the angels, or the angels come to them from your Lord? On the Day when the sign of your Lord is come to them, a sign from the Day of your Lord, who will not believe in it, nor do they believe in it, and do not believe in his faith. Say: 'Wait we are waiting with you.'
Those who have split their religion in sects and became divided with their religion. Their affair is only with Allah. He will inform them of what they used to do.
Whoever brings a good deed, it shall be for his credit, and whosoever does evil, it shall be for his credit, and they will not be wronged.
Say: "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, and the religion of Abraham (Abraham), the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham), Hanifa (i.e. Islamic Monotheism), and he was one of the polytheists.
Say, "My prayer and my sacrifice and my death and my death are for my death, the Lord of the Universe.
He has no partner, and I am commanded to be the first of me, and I am the first to submit."
Say: 'Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah? He is the Lord of all things. Every soul earns no burden against it, and no bearer of burdens shall bear another burden; and to your Lord you will be returned, and He will inform you of what you used to differ.
And He it is Who hath made you viceroys in the earth, and He has exalted you above you, that He may try you with what He has given you. Lo! thy Lord is swift in prosecution, and He is Forgiving, Merciful.
<unk>.
This is the Book which We have sent down to you, so that you may warn it, so that you may warn it, and that it may be a reminder to the believers.
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, so do not follow any other than Him, for you are admonished.
And how many a city We have destroyed, and We destroyed them while they slept at noon.
And when Our scourge fell upon them, they said: "Verily, we were wrong-doers."
Then We shall question those who sent the Messengers before them, and We will question the messengers.
Then We shall narrate to them with knowledge, and We were not absent.
The weighing on that Day will be the truth, and whosesoever balances will be successful.
And as for those whose weights are light, they are the ones who have lost their souls, because they used to deny Our revelations.
And We have made you in the earth a livelihood and appointed for you a livelihood for you, so that you may give thanks.
And indeed We created you, then We shaped you, then We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated themselves, except Iblis, all of them.
He said: "What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?" He said, "I am better than you. You have created me from fire, and You created him from clay."
(Allah) said: "Descend from it, for it is not for you to get it out of it, and you are humiliated.
He said: Reprieve me till the Day of Resurrection.
He said, “You are granted respite.”
He said, “Because You have caused me to go astray, I will waylay me from the Straight Path.”
Then I shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and from behind them and from behind them and from their right, and You will not find most of them ungrateful.”
(Allah) said: "Get out of this, disgraced and disgraced. Then, I will fill Hell with you and follow you all together."
And (We said): "O Adam, dwell in your wife and eat (Paradise), and eat not in this tree, lest ye become one of the wrong-doers."
But Satan whispered to them from the tree that he might make them clear to them what they said, "Your Lord has forbidden you from your tree that you may become your tree to become angels or become angels."
And he swore to them: "I am a trustworthy advisor to you."
Then he made them clear to them, and when they tasted the tree, their nakedness became apparent to them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden. Their Lord called out to them, "Did I not forbid you from the tree that you could not speak to me? Satan was indeed your open enemy."
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us and do not forgive us, we will surely be among the losers."
(Allah) said: "Descend, you will be enemies to the enemies of Allah, and make for you a place of the earth and appointed for you a appointed time.
He said, “You will live therein, and you will live therein, and from it you will be brought forth.”
O Children of Adam! We have sent down to you a garment from your clothing, that you may be comforted, and feathers, and blood, and that which is best. That is the sign of Allah for the people who remember.
O Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you, as he brought your parents out of the Garden, stripping them out of their clothing, and he brought them out of their shame, and you see them, and you see them. We have made the devils friends of those who do not believe.
And when they commit a indecent indecency, they say: "We found our fathers practising it." Say: "Allah has enjoined this to be a witness for us, and to Allah do you do not know."
Say: "My Lord has enjoined justice, and set up your faces, and set up your faces in worship, and call to Him the religion of your religion. He will bring you back to Him, and you will return to Him.
It is He who has guided the people, and guided between them, that they may be guided for those whom Allah has chosen, and they are rightly guided.
O Children of Adam, take your adornment in every place of prayer and eat, and eat. Indeed, Allah does not like the wasteful.
Say, ‘Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has provided for His servants, and the sustenance of His servants?’ Say, ‘These are the life of this world, and the next of life.’ In this there are signs for those who believe.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has forbidden indecent acts of your sin, and the sin (of sin), and the sin (i.e. the sin of the polytheists), and the sin (i.e. the sin of the polytheists), and those who associate partners with Allah (i.e. Allah's Religion of Islamic Monotheism, etc.), and do not associate with Allah with what He has sent down to you, and that which you do not know.
And for every nation is a appointed time; and when their term cometh, they cannot delay it nor can they advance it.
O Children of Adam! When messengers come to you from among you, relating to you My signs, then whosoever practices piety and reforms, no fear shall be on them, nor shall they grieve.
But those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
Who does greater wrong than he who invents lies about Allah, or denies His revelations? Those who have been given the Book, have come to them, until they come to them, and say to them, “Where are you whom you used to pray to besides Allah?” They will say, “They have lost us.” They will say, “They have forsaken us, and that they may testify against themselves.”
Those who say, “Enter the gates of Hell, and you were led into the company of the jinn.” Every group of them will enter the groups, and they will say, ‘Our Lord! You have not led us back to the first time.” Then, when they were returned to it, they will say, “Our Lord! You have led us astray, and give us double punishment; this is what you used to do.”
And the first of them will say to the last of them: "You have no power over you, so taste what you used to earn."
Those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), We shall not enter the gates of the heaven, nor shall they enter Paradise, nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the needle's eye. Thus do We recompense the guilty.
They shall have a bed of Hell, and over them coverings. Thus do We recompense the unjust.
As for those who believe and do good works, We do not impose any soul from his capacity. These are the inhabitants of Paradise, and they will abide therein forever.
And We shall remove their hearts in their breasts, beneath which rivers flow, beneath which rivers flow; and they say: "Our Lord! He has guided us, we could not have guided us. Had we not guided us to guidance, we would not have been guided. This is the truth which the truth has come to us, and that which the truth had come to us, and that which ye have been promised!"
And the dwellers of the Garden will call to the companions of the Fire: "Our Lord, why our Lord has promised us the truth, so that we could not speak to the truth." They will say: "Yes, by our Lord!" They will say: "Yes, but the crier has come to us, and the curse of the disbelievers will be upon the Zalimun (polytheists, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).
Those who hinder others from the way of Allah, and seek to make it crooked, and they were in the Hereafter.
And between them shall be a veil, and on the day when they shall be quarrelling with the people, and the angels will say: "Peace be to you! Peace be to you!" They will be called to enter it, but they will be told: "Peace be to you!"
