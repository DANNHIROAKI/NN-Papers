# TF3D Models

## Model Definition

Each pipeline has its own Model class. The model class has a call function that
receives a dictionary of input tensors on which it runs a deep network with
potentially some postprocessing and returns a dictionary of the computed output
tensors. During the training stage, the model class call function is also in
charge of applying the loss functions to the outputs.

## Model Deep Network

The deep network takes in a sparse set of voxel indices and features and returns
a dictionary of computed output heads. For example, the object detection deep
network predicts the length, height, width, rotation matrix, center, and logits
for each voxel. In the post-processing steps, these predictions are aggregated
and a set of objects are proposed.

We currently support two types of deep networks, the
[UNet Network](###unet-network) and the
[HourGlass Network](###hourglass-network).

### UNet Network

The UNet Network (`tf3d/layers/sparse_voxel_unet.py`) consists of three parts:

*   An encoder that downsamples the input sparse voxels.
*   A bottleneck,
*   A decoder (with skip connections) that upsamples the sparse voxel features
    back to original resolution.

Each part consists of a number of sparse convolution blocks (`SparseConvBlock3D`
in `tf3d/layers/sparse_voxel_net_utils.py`), with possible pooling or unpooling
operations.

The computation scale can be adjusted by changing `SparseConvUNet`'s
`conv_filter_size` and `encoder/bottleneck/decoder_dimensions` parameter values
in the `gin` config files.

This network is the default for the 3d semantic and instance segmentation tasks
currently.

details.

### HourGlass Network

The HourGlass Network (`tf3d/layers/sparse_voxel_hourglass.py`) is one or multiple stacked UNet Networks.

This network is used by the 3d object detection task currently.

## Output Head

The output head takes in (sparse) voxel features as input, and produces
per-voxel prediction with a specific dimension.

Each output head is implemented as two sparse convolution blocks
(`SparseConvBlock3D` in `tf3d/layers/sparse_voxel_net_utils.py`).

Each task will have one or multiple output heads, as described below.

## 3D Semantic Segmentation

The 3D Semantic Segmentation model (`tf3d/semantic_segmentation/model.py`) by
default uses the UNet Network as the backbone, and has only one output head for
predicting per-voxel semantic logits. At inference time, the voxel logits are
transferred back to the points to output per-point logits.

## 3D Instance Segmentation

The 3D Instance Segmentation model (`tf3d/instance_segmentation/model.py`) by
default uses the UNet Network as the backbone, and have two output heads for
predicting per-voxel semantic logits, and instance embedding. During the
post-processing step, a greedy algorithm picks one instance seed at a time, and
uses the distance between the voxel embeddings to group them into segments.

## 3D Object Detection

The 3D Object Detection model (`tf3d/object_detection/model.py`) by default uses
the Hour Glass Network as the backbone, and have output heads for predicting
per-voxel object semantic logits, size, center, and rotation matrix.
