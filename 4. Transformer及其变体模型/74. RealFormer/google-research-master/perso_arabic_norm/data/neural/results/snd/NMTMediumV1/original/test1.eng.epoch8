The All-Merciful, the All-Merciful.
All praise is to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Resurrection.
You worship, and we are the helpers, the All-Knowing.
Guide us to the Straight Path.
The path of those whom You have blessed, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who are astray.
Alif Lam Mim.
This is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guidance for those who fear Allah.
Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them, and spend for them what We have given them.
And who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was sent down before you, and they are certain of the Hereafter.
These are on guidance from their Lord, and it is they who are the successful.
As for those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or warn them not, they will not believe.
God has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their eyes is a covering, and there is a great punishment for them.
And there are some people who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, but they are not believers.
They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none but themselves, and they perceive not.
In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they lie.
And when it is said to them: Make not mischief on the earth, they say: We are peacemakers.
Indeed, they are the corrupters, and they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Shall we believe as the fools have believed?" But they are the fools, but they do not know.
And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe; but when they are alone with their devils, they say: Lo! we were mocking.
Allah mocks them, and in their rebellion they will wander in their rebellion, and they will wander in their rebellion.
Those are they who have purchased error for guidance, so their commerce has no profit, and they are not guided.
Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, and they will not see.
Deaf, dumb and blind, they will not return.
Or it is like the rain of the sky, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, and lightning; they put their fingers into their ears, and Allah encompasses the disbelievers.
The lightning almost turns away from their eyes; whenever it covers them, they are in it, and when it covers them, they are in it; and if Allah wills, He will have their sight and their sight; surely Allah is powerful over everything.
O mankind, worship your Lord Who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous.
Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky a canopy, and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth fruits for you for your sustenance; so do not set up rivals to Allah, and do not set up rivals to Him.
And if you are in doubt as to what We have sent down (i.e. the Qur’an) to Our slave (Muhammad SAW), then produce a Surah like the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do it not, and you will never do it, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will say, "This is what we had given us." They will say, "This is what we had been given before." They will say, "This is what we were given before." They will have their spouses, and they will live therein.
God is not ashamed of the gnat, or a gnat, but those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; and those who disbelieve say, "What is this matter?" But those who disbelieve say, "What is God's likeness?" He causes many of them astray, and He will guide many of them. He causes many of them astray. He causes many of them astray.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after its break, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the earth; they are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will cause you to die, then to Him you will be returned?
He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth, and He directed the heaven to Himself, and He has made it seven heavens, and He has full knowledge of everything.
And when your Lord said to the angels, "I am going to make a vicegerent on the earth," they said, "Will You place it in place and shed blood, and we glorify Your holiness and glorify Your holiness?" He said, "I know what you do not know."
And He taught Adam all the names, then presented them to the angels, and said, "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-knowing, the All-wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names, and when their father had informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth? I know what you conceal and what you reveal."
And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam"; they prostrated themselves, but he was arrogant, and he was arrogant.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the garden, and eat of the fruits of the garden, and eat of it, but do not approach this tree, lest ye be of the unjust.
Then Satan made it slip from them, so We saved them from what they were in, and We said, "Get down from it, you are enemies of one another, and for you there is a provision for you, and a provision for the earth."
Then Adam received from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord turned towards him; surely He is the Relenting, the Merciful.
We said, “Get down from all of you, from this, and there comes to you guidance from Me, and whoever follows My guidance, there is no fear on them, nor will they grieve.”
But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill your covenant with Me, and I will fulfill My covenant with you, and fear Me alone.
And believe in what I have revealed to you, confirming what is with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in My signs, nor sell My signs for a small price; and fear Me, and fear Me.
And do not confound the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth while you know.
And establish prayer and give zakah and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin the people to do good deeds, and forget yourselves while you recite the Book? Do you not understand?
And seek help with patience and prayer, and indeed, it is hard except for the humbly submissive [to Allah].
Those who know that they will meet their Lord, and to Him they will return.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you over the worlds.
And guard yourselves against a Day when no soul shall avail another, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall compensation be accepted from it, nor shall they be helped.
And (remember) when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women, and in that there was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and drowned Pharaoh and drowned the people of Pharaoh.
And when We appointed for Moses forty nights, then you took the calf after him, and you were unjust.
Then We pardoned them so that you might be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion that you might be guided aright.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves for the calf. So turn your back to your Lord, and kill your Maker. That is what is best for you in the best of your own souls. He has mercy on you, and He is the All-forgiving, the All-merciful."
And when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah outright." Then the thunderbolt seized you while you were looking at.
Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful.
And We shaded you with clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails, and said: Eat of the good things We have provided you, and do not wrong Us; they wronged themselves.
And when We said: Enter this town and eat of it, and eat of it, and enter the gate and enter the gate, and say, "Our sins, we will forgive your sins, and We will give you the good reward."
But those who were unjust changed to them changed other words, so We sent down upon them a punishment from the heavens, so We sent down upon them a punishment from heaven.
And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said, "Strike the rock with your staff." And twelve springs gushed forth from it, and every tribe knew its drinking drinking. And it was said to them, "Eat of the provision of Allah, and do not commit corruption in the earth."
And when you said, "O Moses, we will not be patient with you with any food, so that your Lord will bring us out of the land, and its cucumbers, and its cucumbers, and its garlic, and its lentils, and its onions." He said, "What is the best for you?
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you may be Godwary.
Then you turned back after you turned away, and it was not for Allah’s grace upon you and His mercy.
“And you have already known of those among you who transgressed in the Sabbath, and We said to them, ‘Be apes, despised.’
So We made it a sign for the people of the city, and the latter of it, and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
And when Moses said to his people, "Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Why do you ridicule us?" They said, "I am of the ignorant."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what it is." He said, "It is a cow that is neither old nor young." He said, "It is not a cow, nor a young man."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what is what it is." He said, "He is a yellow cow, a yellow yellow eye."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what it is. To us are the cows alike. And if Allah wills, we will be guided."
He said, "It is said, 'It is a cow that is a cow, nor a cow, nor the grain of the field.' They said, "You have come to come," and they said, "You have come to come." They said, "You have come to come, so they did not take it."
And when you killed a man, and disputed among yourselves, then Allah revealed to you what you were hiding.
Then We said: Strike the part of a cow, so that Allah may bring the dead to life, and He will bring you to the dead, so that you may understand.
Then after that, your hearts were hardened, and if they were like them, they were like rocks, and rocks, or rocks, and rocks of stones; and there are some of them who are divided with water, and some of them are water; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you expect that they should have faith in you, while a party of them have a party of a party who heard the word of Allah, then they understood it after they understood it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with each other, they say, "Do you tell them what Allah has revealed to you, that they may argue with you concerning your Lord?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare?
And among them are those who do not know the Book, but they do not know the Book, and they are only guessing.
Woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and they will say, "This is from Allah," so that they may sell it for a small price, and woe to them for what their hands have earned, and woe to them for what they earned.
And they say: "The Fire will not touch us but for a few days." Say: "Have you taken a promise from Allah?" Say, "Have you taken a promise from Allah, or do you not know what you do?"
Nay, those who do evil and treat him with arrogance,- they are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, they are companions of Paradise, to dwell therein.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but Allah, and do good to your parents, and to your parents, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and speak good to men, and pay the poor-rate, and pay the poor-rate.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you (saying): "Do not shed your blood, nor turn your backs from your people, and you will be witnesses, then you were witnesses."
You shall be among those who kill your people, and a group from among your people, and a group from among his people, and some of them from among them, from among them, from among them, and from among them from among them. And from among them are some of them, from among them, from among them, and from among them. And if they reach it, it will be said to them, "It is not lawful for you that you should take it upon them." And the punishment of the Day of Resurrection is only for you, and Allah is not aware of what you do.
Those are they who bought the life of the world for the Hereafter, so their punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.
And We gave Moses the Book, and We sent after him apostles, and We gave Jesus the son of Mary, and We gave the son of Mary clear proofs, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit; and some of you were arrogant, and some of you were arrogant.
And they say: Our hearts are hardened in their hearts; but Allah has cursed them for their unbelief, so they will believe.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which is with them, and that they may seek the help of those who disbelieved before, and when they come to it, they have disbelieved in it; and the curse of Allah is upon those who disbelieve.
Evil is that which Allah has revealed to them, but they disbelieve in what Allah has revealed to His servants, and that Allah may send down upon His servants whom He wills of His servants, and they have incurred wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers there is a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us," but they disbelieve in what is revealed to us.
Moses came to you with clear proofs, but you worshipped the calf, and you were unjust.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you and raised Mount Sinai above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen to them, and they said: We hear and we obey. And they said: "We hear what is wrong for you." Say: "What is the matter for you that you should believe in Allah, if you are believers."
Say: "If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and the exclusion of mankind, then wish for death if you are truthful."
And they will never wish for it, for they will never wish for it, for they will never wish for it; and Allah is the Knower of the wrongdoers.
And most surely you will find them more than the greediest of the people and the idolaters, and every one of them will wish to be a thousand years; and if he is a thousand years, he will not be able to save him from the punishment; and Allah is Seeing of what they do.
Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, he has sent down to your heart what is before it, confirming what is before it, and guidance and glad tidings for the believers.
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael, surely Allah is the enemy of the disbelievers.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) clear signs, and none will deny them except the defiantly disobedient.
Is it not a time when they will come to pass, a party of them will not believe? But most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming what has come to them, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they were not aware.
They follow the footsteps of Satan, Satan's footsteps, so that they might not be deceived by Satan, and the demons were cast away by them, and they did not know what they were doing, and they did not know what they were doing, and they were in the land, and they did not have the power to come to them, but they said, "We are only the ones who have no power over it." And they will have no share between them, but they will not be able to do anything.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, then the reward from Allah would have been better for them if they knew.
O you who believe! Do not say, "Do not say, 'Do not say, "Do not say," and say, "Be not ignorant." And the disbelievers have a painful punishment.
The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) are not among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and the polytheists (polytheists and Christians) from your own souls, that you may wish that your Lord should bring it to you as He wills whom He wills, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.
Whatever a verse (Qur’an) do not abrogate, or cause it to be forgotten, but We bring it to a better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah hath power over all things?
Do you not know that Allah is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and that you have no protector or helper?
Or do you wish to ask your Messenger as Moses asked Moses? He has gone astray from believing, and he has gone astray from the right path.
Many of the People of the Book wish that they turn away from you after you have believed after you have believed in their hearts, after the truth has come to them, after the truth has become manifest to them, so forgive them and forgive them; surely Allah is powerful over everything.
And establish prayer and pay the charity and pay the good to your souls before you, and you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah sees what you do.
And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian, and they are their own minds." Say: "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Nay, whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is a doer of good, his reward is with his Lord, and there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians have nothing to follow," and the Christians say, "The Jews are nothing but a religion." They recite the Scripture. They say, "The Jews are the ones who do not know." On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will judge between them concerning what they differed.
And who is more unjust than he who prevents the mosques of Allah that His name should be remembered in His name, and strives for their ruin? It is not for them to enter them in fear, except that they should fear them, and they will have a great punishment in the Hereafter.
To Allah belong the East and the West; then wherever you turn back, then Allah is the All-Sufficient, the All-knowing.
And they say: Allah has taken a son. Glory be to Him! Glory be to Him in Whom is in the heavens and on earth; all are sincere to Him.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, when He decrees a thing, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is.
And those who do not know say, "Why does God not speak to us or to bring us a sign?" And those before them said, "Their hearts are like their hearts." Their hearts are like their hearts, and We have indeed explained the signs for a people who believe.
We have sent you with the truth, as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the companions of the Fire.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the Christians, until you follow their religion. Say: "Allah's guidance is guidance." Say, "The guidance of Allah is guidance, and there has come to you the knowledge that has come to you, and if you follow their desires, you will have no protector, nor any helper."
Those to whom We have given the Book read it, and it is recited to them that they believe therein; they believe in it, and they do not believe in it.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you over the worlds.
And fear a Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall they be helped.
And (remember) when Ibrahim (Abraham) said to his Lord in order to test them, and he fulfilled it, and He said, "I am going to make you a leader for mankind." He said: "I am a leader of you." And He said: "This is My promise for the unjust."
And when We appointed for the people a place for the people and a sanctuary for the people, We made it a place of prayer for Abraham, and We made Abraham a place of prayer for Abraham, and Abraham, and Ishmael, and Ishmael, and those who bow prostrate, and those who bow prostrate, and those who prostrate themselves, and those who bow prostrate,
And (remember) when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city secure and feed its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said, "I will give him a little more than a little while, then I will give him the punishment of the Fire, and it will be an evil place for him."
And when Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House, Our Lord said: Our Lord! accept from us; surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing.
Our Lord, make us submissive to Thee submissive to Thee, and make our progeny submissive to Thee, and show us our rites, and turn towards us, and forgive us; surely Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.
Our Lord, raise up among them a messenger from among themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and the wisdom and purify them. You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And who turns away from the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham), except the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham), and We chose him in this world and in the Hereafter, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, “Submit,” he said, “I submit to the Lord of the worlds.”
And Abraham instructed his sons and Jacob, saying, "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except as Muslims.
Have you considered your death, when he raised up his son, when he said to his sons, "Worship me, your fathers, your fathers, and the God of your fathers?" They said, "We will worship your God and your God, and to Him we are Muslims."
This is a nation that has passed away; for them is what they have earned, and for what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
And they say, "Be Jews or Christians," you will be guided, "We follow the religion of Abraham, the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the idolaters."
Say, "We believe in Allah, and in what has been sent down to us, and that which has been sent down to us, and Ishmael, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses and the prophets, and what was given to them from their Lord. We make no difference between any of them, and we are Muslims."
But if they believe in what they believe, they are indeed guided; but if they turn away, they are in schism; but Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
(22) (112) (112) (And it is) the religion of Allah, and who is better than Allah?
Say: "Do you dispute with us about Allah, while He is our Lord and your Lord?
Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, "Whether you know Allah, or do you know that Allah is better than him?" And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
These are a people who have passed away; for them is what they have earned, and for you is what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they did.
The people of the people will say, "What has turned them back from the qiblah?" Say, "To the east and the west, God guides whom He wills and guides whom He wills."
Thus We have made you a middle community, so that you may be witnesses over the people, and the Messenger as a witness over you, and the Messenger was a witness over you, and the Messenger was a witness over you, and it was not for the Messenger who had passed away before you; and Allah is the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
We will see your turning away from the heaven, and We shall turn you to a qiblah like whom you will, so turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you are, it will be the truth from their Lord, and those who are given the Book know that it is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not aware of what they do.
And if you were to bring the Book to all the people of the Book, they would not follow your qiblah, nor will they follow your qiblah, nor will they follow your qiblah, nor are they to follow the qiblah of their own desires, if it has come to you, then you will be of the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We gave the Book know it as they know their sons, and some of them know the truth, and some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of the doubters.
And there has been a direction for him to turn to it, so vie with him in good deeds; wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together; surely Allah is powerful over everything.
And wherever you are, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; surely it is the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not aware of what you do.
And from wherever you are, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your faces towards your faces, so that they may have no argument against the people, but do not fear them, but do not fear them, but do not fear them, so that I may complete My blessing upon you, so that you may be guided.
Similarly, We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, reciting to you Our Verses, and sanctifying you, and instructing you the Book and the Wisdom, and teaching you that which you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you and give thanks to Me and be grateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek help with patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the patient.
“And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah’s way as dead; they are alive, but you do not perceive.”
And We will test you with fear and hunger, and in wealth and lives and fruits and fruits, but give glad tidings to those who give good news.
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: Surely we belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.
Those are they on whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord, and they are the ones who are guided.
Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah; and whoever performs the pilgrimage or the pilgrimage, it is no blame on them; and whoever does good, then it is not for them to enter it; and whoever does good, then surely Allah is Ever-Knowing, All-Knowing.
Those who have been sent down by the truth and the guidance, We have sent down to them the Book in which We have sent down to them the Book, and they are cursed by the curse of God, and they will curse the curse of God.
Except those who repent and amend and amend, then I will turn to them, and I am the All-merciful, the All-merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, they are on the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and of all mankind.
They will abide therein, the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.
And your God is One God; there is no God but He, the Merciful, the Merciful.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth and the earth, and the night, and the day, and the day, and the day, and the fish, and the stars, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, in between them, and in the earth, in the land, and in the earth, and in the earth, and in the earth. In the earth, there are signs in the earth.
And of mankind are some who set up rivals to Allah, as they love Allah as they love Allah, and those who believe are in the love of Allah; and those who do wrong will know that they will see the punishment, and if they see the punishment, they will know that Allah is severe in retribution.
When those who were followed followed those who followed them, they will see the punishment, and they will be cut off from their sides.
And those who followed will say, "If only we had returned to Him, we would certainly have lost them." So God will show them their deeds, so that God will show them their deeds, and they will not be able to escape the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is in the earth, and eat of the footsteps of the devil, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your open enemy.
He enjoins you to do evil and indecency, and that you should speak to Allah what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say, "We follow what we found our fathers following." Even though their fathers had no knowledge of their fathers, nor were they guided.
And the likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of those who listen to Him as one who hears nothing but calls and cries, deaf and deaf; they do not understand.
O you who believe! eat of the good things which We have provided you and give thanks to Allah if it is Him that you worship.
He has forbidden you only carrion and blood, and the flesh of swine, and the swine, and the swine, which is invoked by the name of Allah; but whoever is constrained by necessity, there is no sin on him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The people of the Book conceal what Allah has revealed to them and purchase a small price for a small price, but they will not be able to hide their bellies, but Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
Those are they who have purchased error for guidance and for forgiveness for forgiveness.
This is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth, and those who dispute among the Book are in a great opposition.
You are not to be able to move to the east, the west, the west, the <unk>, the good, the righteous, the righteous, the faithful, the angels, the Prophets, the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and those are the ones who are truthful.
O you who have believed, there has been given to you the power of the Holy Spirit, but the wife of the woman is a woman who has a wife, and he is a woman who is a wife of the woman, so that his brother may be left in the right hand, and if he is given the right hand, then it is a matter from your Lord. This is a mercy from your Lord, and for him is a painful punishment.
And there is a life for you in this world, that you may be righteous.
“It is prescribed for you when death approaches one of you, if he leaves any goods, that he may bequeath to parents and relatives, according to reasonable usage.

But if any one fears the testator or the testator, and that he may judge between the parties, there is no blame on him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! fasting has been prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may be righteous.
The number of a number of days is a number of days, and some of you are sick, or on a journey on the Day of Resurrection; and those who have no power over it, the feeding of the feeding of the poor is for the feeding of the poor; and whoever does good, it is better for him; but if you have knowledge, it is better for you if you know.
The Qur’an is the Qur’an, and it is in the Qur’an that which is revealed to mankind, and to the people that is a guidance, and it is a confirmation of the Qur'an, and a confirmation of the Qur'an, and it is clear to you that there is a burden between you on the Day of Resurrection, and that there is a witness between you on the day when He has guided you, and that which has been guided for you is a burden on the Day of Resurrection, and that which has been guided for you is the burden of Allah.

And I have come confirming that which was before me of the Taurat (Torah) and that which was forbidden to you, and some of you have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me.
Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord; therefore worship Him; this is a straight path.
When Jesus saw their unbelief, he said, "Who will be my helpers?" The disciples said, "We are the helpers of Allah. We believe in Allah and bear witness that we are Muslims."
Our Lord! We believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger, so write us down among the witnesses.
And they (the Jews) schemed, and Allah schemed, and Allah is the best of deceivers.
When Allah said, "O Jesus, I will raise you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you above those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. To Me is your return, then to Me will be your return, and I will judge between you concerning that concerning which you differed."
As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with severe agony in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.
And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their rewards, and Allah does not love the unjust.
This is what We recite to you (O Muhammad SAW), and of the Book (the Qur’an), the Wise, the Wise.
“The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, “Be”, and he was.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.
And whoever has come to you with knowledge after knowledge has come to you, say, "Come, let us, our sons, and your sons, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and we will call you to the curse of Allah."
There is no God but He; there is no God but He; Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
But if they turn away, surely Allah knows the mischief of the corrupters.
Say: "O People of the Book (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah."
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not sent down after him? Will you not then understand?
You are the ones who have argued about what you have argued about, but why do you argue about that which you have no knowledge?
Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian, but he was a Muslim, a Muslim, and he was not of the idolaters.
The people of Abraham are those who follow him, and those who follow him and those who believe in him, and Allah is the Protector of the believers.
A group of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they do not lead themselves astray, but they do not perceive.
O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah while you are witnesses?
O People of the Book, why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?
And some of the People of the Book say: "Believe in what has been sent down to the believers in the morning, and disbelieve in it in the morning, that they may turn away, so that they may turn away."
And do not believe in any other religion except for the guidance of your religion. Say, "The guidance is the guidance of Allah." Say, "Do not believe in that which has been given to you." Say, "The like of that is what is given to you." Say: "In the hand of Allah is the grace of Allah, He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing."
He gives mercy to whom He wills, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.
And among the People of the Book are among the people who believe with a wealth of gold, if it is with you, if it is of them, he will leave it with you, and some of them will not leave it until you trust him. That is because they say, "There is no blame on us." That is because they say, "There is no blame on us, and they will lie to Allah."
But whoever fulfills his pledge and fears Allah, then surely Allah loves those who fear Him.
Those who sell the covenant of Allah and their oaths for a small price, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them, nor will He look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
And there are a group among them who distort the Book with their tongues, that you may think that you were part of the Book, and it was not of the Book, and they say, "This is from Allah," and they say, "This is from Allah," and they know that they lied.
It is not for any human being to whom Allah has given him the Book and the wisdom and the Prophethood and the Prophethood will say to him, "Be my servants instead of Allah."
And He will not enjoin you to believe in the angels and the prophets, and you will have submitted to Allah what you have been Muslims.
And (remember) when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets (saying): "I have given you the Book and Wisdom, and then there comes to you a Messenger (Muhammad SAW) confirming what is with you, you must believe in him and you will believe in him."
But whoever turns away after this, they are the transgressors.
Do they seek other than Allah as a religion, and whatever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, willingly and unwillingly?
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "We believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to us, and in what has been sent down to Abraham, Isma'il, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses and the Prophets. We make no difference between any of them, and to Him we submit."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief, and that they bore witness that the Messenger was true and the truth came to them? And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Those are the ones that are on the curse of Allah, the angels, the angels, and all mankind.
They will live therein, and will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.
Except those who repent thereafter and reform; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who reject Faith after their belief, then increase in disbelief in unbelief, their repentance will not be accepted, and they are indeed misguided.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, they shall not be accepted from all the earth, even as it would be accepted for them to ransom it, and it will not be accepted for them, for they shall have a painful punishment, and they shall have no helpers.
By no means will you attain righteousness unless you give out of that which you love; and whatever you give, Allah knows it well.
All food were lawful for the Children of Israel except that the Children of Israel had been lawful to the Law of Moses. Say, "Bring the Torah, if you are truthful."
Then after that, those who invent falsehood after Allah, they are the wrongdoers.
Say: "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) Hanifa (Islamic Monotheism, Islamic Monotheism), and he was not of the polytheists."
Indeed, the first House (of worship) established for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), blessed (Makkah), and a guidance for the worlds.
Surely there are signs in the signs of Abraham; and whoever enters it is secure, and whoever enters it is safe for the pilgrimage, and for the pilgrimage to the pilgrimage, it is for the people to whom it is a way; and whoever disbelieves in it, surely Allah is Self-sufficient, All-sufficient.
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, while Allah is Witness over what you do?"
Say, "O People of the Scripture, why do you seek to follow the path of Allah, seeking the path to prevent you from the path of God?"
“O you who believe! if you obey a group of those who are given the Book, they will turn you back after you have believed, after you have believed.”
How do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah? And whoever is in the communications of Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW), and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW) is in you. And whoever takes fast to Allah, He has guided him to a Straight Path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast (O Muhammad SAW) to the rope of Allah (i.e. the Taurat (Hajj)), and do not be divided, and remember Allah's blessing upon you, and remember your hearts, when you were enemies, and you became brothers in your hearts, and you were brothers on the brink of the Fire, and you were brothers of the Fire. Thus Allah makes clear to you His signs, so that you may be guided.
And among you there is a party of you who invites to good, enjoin the good and enjoin what is wrong, and it is they who are successful.
And be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs, and they shall have a great punishment.
On the day when some faces will be white, and some faces will be black, and those whose faces are black will be said to them, "Did you disbelieve after accepting your faith?" Then taste the punishment for what you disbelieved.
And as for those whose faces are white, they will be in the mercy of Allah, for they will dwell therein.
These are the signs of Allah, We rehearse them to you in truth; and Allah does not wish to do injustice to the worlds.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Him is all that is returned.
You are the best of the people who have been created, and what is right, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and if the People of the Book have believed, it would be better for them, and if the People of the Book had believed, it would be better for them, and most of them are transgressors.
They will not harm you, but they will not harm you, and if they fight you, they will turn you back, then they will not be helped.
They will be afflicted with ignominy, except for the people and men, except by Allah's wrath, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah, and that is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah, and they disobeyed the prophets, and they disobeyed the Prophets.
They are not all alike; there is a community standing among the People of the Book, reciting the verses of Allah during periods of the night and prostrating the prayer.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and forbid what is wrong; and they are among the righteous.
And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it; and Allah is Knowing of the pious.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their possessions nor their children will avail them aught against Allah; they are companions of the Fire, they will dwell therein.
The likeness of that which they spend in the life of this world is like a wind that smites the wind, and the people who have wronged themselves, it is they who have wronged themselves, and they destroy it; and Allah has not wronged them.
O you who believe! Do not take for friends other than your own selves, but they will not be allowed to harm you for you. They love what distresses you. Their hatred is apparent from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater. We have indeed made clear to you the signs, so that you may understand.
You are the ones who love them, but they do not love you, and you believe in Allah and the Book. They will say, "We believe." They will say, "We believe." And when they meet you, they bite you with rage. Say, "Do not die. God knows what is in the breasts."
If any good befalls you, it grieves them; but if any misfortune befalls you, they rejoice in it; but if you are patient, they will rejoice in it. And if you are patient, your guile will not harm you. God encompasses what they do.
And (remember) when you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) went forth from your household early at the morning, for the believers fought against the battle, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
When two groups of you were resolved to take advantage of it, and Allah was their protector, and the believers put their trust in Allah.
Allah had helped you at Badr when you were small, so fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down?"
Nay, if you are patient and Godwary, and if you attack the enemy, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels, angels, angels.
And Allah did not send it except as a good news for you, and that your hearts might rest in it, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
That He might cut off a party of those who disbelieve, or expose them in infamy, so that they retire frustrated.
It is not for you whether He pardons them or punishes them or punishes them; surely they are wrongdoers.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! Do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that you may be successful.
And fear the Fire for those who disbelieve, for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, that ye may receive mercy.
“And march forth for forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.”
Those who spend (in charity) in prosperity and hardship, and in adversity, and who restrain anger, and pardon men; and Allah loves the doers of good.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; and who can forgive sins except Allah, and do not knowingly persist in what they have done?
For them is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will dwell therein, and they will abide for ever. How excellent is the reward of the workers.
Many have passed away before you, so travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is an exposition for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
And do not weaken and grieve, and do not grieve, if you are believers, if you are believers.
If a wound has afflicted you, then a wound has afflicted the people, and it is We who will separate them in the land, and that Allah may know those who believe and have witnesses from among you; and Allah does not love the unjust.
That that Allah may believe in the believers and destroy the disbelievers.
Do you think that you will enter Paradise while Allah has not made known of you those who are steadfast, and who are steadfast with patience?
And you have already met for death before you met it, so you have seen it, and you have seen it.
Muhammad is no more than a messenger. Messengers have already passed away before him; if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? And whoever turns back on his heels will never harm Allah, and Allah will reward the grateful.
And it is not for any soul to die except for the leave of Allah; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him thereof, and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We shall give him thereof, and We shall reward him for the good of the Hereafter.
And many of the prophets fought in Allah’s cause, and many of them were oppressed, so they did not have lost what befell them in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, and Allah loves the patient.
They said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our sins, and make firm our feet, and make firm our feet, and give us victory over the disbelieving people."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the reward of the Hereafter, and Allah loves the doers of good.
O you who believe! if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will turn back losers.
Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
“Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He sent down no authority, and their abode is the Fire; and evil is the abode of the wrong-doers.”
Allah has promised the promise of your promise to you, so when you broke the covenant of your covenant, you slew yourselves and disputed in the matter, and you differed in the matter of the matter, and that you might argue with you after that which has been given you, and you have been given to you in the Hereafter, and He has made you some of you. He has pardoned you, and He has pardoned you. And Allah is the Owner of the believers.
When you ran away, then he was not ashamed of any one, and the Messenger was calling you back from your rear, so He did not punish you with what you had earned, and He did not grieve for what you had earned, and Allah is aware of what you do.
Then He sent down for you a light, a party of you, and a party of you a party of a group, and some of them were a party of another. And they said, “What is it that we have been doing?” They said, “What is good for us?” They said, “What is good for us is what is in your homes?” They said, “What is it that is good for us?” They said, “What is the matter with us?” They said, “What is the matter with us?” They said, “This is what is what is in your houses.” And Allah knows what is in your hearts. And Allah knows what is in your hearts, and Allah knows what is in your hearts.
Those of you who turned away from the day when the two armies met, the devil was made to appear to them because of what they had earned, but Allah has pardoned them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O ye who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when they go out of the land, and when they travel in the land, or fight, or say, "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, they would not have died, and they would not have been slain, so that Allah may bring it into their hearts, and Allah is Seeing of what you do."
And if you are slain or die in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all that they amass.
And if you die or die, then surely, you will be gathered to Allah.
So it is by the mercy of Allah that you deal with them gently, and if you were harsh and hard, they would certainly have dispersed from you, so pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them and ask forgiveness for them; then when you have decided, then put your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, there is none who can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, then who is there that can help you after Him? And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
It is not for any prophet to betray the Messenger, but he who deceives himself with what he has done, he will come on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul will be recompensed for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who has incurred the wrath of Allah, and whose abode is Hell, and it is an evil destination!
They are in varying ranks, and Allah sees what they do.
God has blessed the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them, and instructing them in the Book and Wisdom, although they had been in manifest error.
And when a disaster befalls you, if you were afflicted twice twice, you said, "This is what is it?" Say, "This is from your own hands. God has power over everything."
And what befell you on the day when the two armies met you, by Allah's leave, that He might know the believers, and that He might know the believers.
And He knew that the hypocrites and the hypocrites said: "Come to fight in Allah's way, or to fight." They said, "If only we had been fighting, we would certainly have followed you." But if they were nearer to unbelief, they would have been nearer to faith than believing in their hearts. They say, "God knows what is in their hearts, and what they conceal."
They are the ones who say to their brothers, "If they had believed, they would not have been killed." Say, "If you are truthful, then death is from death, if you are truthful."
“And reckon not those who are killed in Allah’s way as dead; nay, they are alive, with their Lord, their Lord.”
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them, in His bounty, and those who have not joined them with those who are behind them; they have no fear, nor will they grieve.
They rejoice in the Grace of Allah and His Bounty, and that Allah does not reward the believers.
Those who responded to the call of Allah and the Messenger after the wound had come to them, and those of them who do good, and fear Allah, for them is a great reward.
Those to whom the people said, "Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them," but it increased them in faith and they said, "Sufficient for us is Allah, and He is the best of affairs."
So they returned from Allah’s grace and grace, no harm touched them, and they followed the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.
It is only Satan that suggests to you his friends, so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And let not those grieve thee who have despaired of their disbelief; they will not harm Allah at all, but Allah will not give them any portion in the Hereafter, and they will have a great punishment.
Those who purchase unbelief in unbelief, do not harm Allah, for them is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite for them is better for them. We only give them respite for their sins, so they will have a humiliating punishment.
It is not for Allah that you are in what is in your hands, until He separates the good from the good, and Allah does not know what you know in the Unseen, and Allah chooses His messengers to know whom He wills, and Allah chooses His messengers to know whom He wills; so believe in Allah and His Messengers.
And let not those who have been given the grace of Allah that He has given them of His bounty, that it may be better for them. Nay, it is bad for them that they will be niggardly of their necks on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is the One Who is aware of what you do.
Allah has heard the saying of those who say: "Allah is the Most High, and we are rich." We sent down what they said, and their prophets and their prophets will say to them: "Taste the punishment of the Fire, so taste the punishment of the Fire."
This is because of what your hands have sent before, and because Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say, "Allah has promised us that we should not believe in any messenger until he brings us a sacrifice." Say, "Messengers have come to you before you, and have come to you with clear proofs. So kill them, if you speak the truth, and then kill them."
But if they reject you, they have rejected messengers before you, who came with Clear signs, with clear proofs, and the Book of Enlightenment.
Every soul shall taste death, and you shall not be paid your reward on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever is driven away from the Fire, he has already attained the great life. And the life of this world is but a temporary loss.
You shall surely be tested in your wealth and your souls, and you will hear from those who were given the Book before you and from those who were given the Book before you, and if you are patient, and if you are patient, then indeed, this is the matter of determination.
And (remember) when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book (i.e. the Qur’an), that He may make it clear to mankind, and that they will not hide it, but they will not hide it behind it, and they will have sold it behind it, and it is an evil thing that they have forgotten.
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love what they do not have to be praised for what they have not done, do not think that they will have a painful punishment, and they will have a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over everything.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of the night and the day, there are signs for men of understanding.
Those who remember Allah, standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: "Our Lord, You have not created this in vain.
Our Lord! Thou wilt admit him to the Fire, Thou wilt have disgraced him, and for the wrong-doers there shall be no helpers.
Our Lord, we have heard the call of a caller calling to faith, so believe in your Lord and believe in our Lord. Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and remit our evil deeds, and make us die with the righteous.
Our Lord, give us what You have promised us by His Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. You never break the promise.
So their Lord answered them: "I will not be among you a male or a female, nor of you, nor of you, nor of you, nor of you, and from among you, and I will cause you to die in your homes, and I will cause you to die in the way of Allah, and I will admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will have a great reward."
Do not let the unbelievers deceive you in the land.
This is a brief enjoyment, and their abode is Hell, and evil is the destination.
But as for those who fear their Lord, they are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever; for them are a goodly gift from Allah, and that which is with Him is the best of the righteous.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to you and in what has been sent down to you, and they are humble before Allah, they are not a small price for the communications of Allah, and they have not tasted the communications of Allah, for them is their reward; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
O ye who believe! persevere in patience and constancy, and remain steadfast in patience; and fear Allah that ye may prosper.
O mankind, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single soul, and created him from a single soul, and from his mate, and from them both scattered abroad from many men and women; and fear Allah, and give your duty to Him. Indeed Allah watches over you.
And give the orphans their wealth and do not exchange the good for it, and do not devour your property with their property; surely, it is a great sin.
And if you fear that you will not be able to deal with the orphans, marry the women to marry you with two wives, two or four, or four, or four, or four, if you fear that you will not be able to do justice, but if you fear that you will not be able to do justice.
And give the women their dowries as a free gift; but if they give you a good portion of it, then give it to you with good cheer, and you will enjoy it with good cheer.
And do not let the foolish among them do not give your wealth to Allah for a means of livelihood for you, and provide for them from among them, and clothe them with kindness and speak to them with kindness.
And give the orphans until the age of age until they have reached their age until the age of the age of age. If you are in them, then give them their property, and do not consume the property of the orphans, and do not eat of them, nor be afraid of the property of the poor. And if any of the poor is rich, let them give you a portion of their property. And if you give them their property, then witness to them. Allah is sufficient as a Reckoner.
A portion of the wealth of the parents, and the relatives, and the relatives, and the wives, and the relatives, and the relatives, and the wives, or a small portion of their relatives.
And when relatives are present in the division and the orphans and the needy, give them out of it, and speak to them words of kindness.
And let them fear that they should have left behind their offspring if they were behind them, so let them fear Allah, and let them speak good words.
Those who consume the wealth of the orphans consume their bellies in their bellies, and they will roast in Hell.
God has given you your sons, the two sons, the wives of their wives, and the wives of the two sons are better than one of them; and if they marry, it is for the two of them; and if it is, it is for the two of them, except that which is in the hands of God; and if it is, it is for them, that it may be given to them; and if it is not for the children of old, it is for them, and it is not for any of them.
And the wives of your wives have been given to you, as if they had a son, a son, a son, a child, if they have a child, if they have a child, then if you have a child, they will have a portion of what you have given them, and if you have a child, they will have a portion of what you have given them, and if you have a child, they will have a share for them, and if you have a child, they will have a portion of them.
These are the limits of Allah, and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein, and that is the supreme achievement.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will admit him to the Fire, to dwell therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment.
If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, then call against four witnesses from among you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses from among you, until they testify, confine them to houses until death takes them, or Allah will guide them for a way.
And as for the two of you who are guilty of indecency, give them both of them; then if they repent and amend, turn away from them; surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allah accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent thereafter; then they will turn to Allah in repentance, and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
There is no repentance for those who continue to do evil until death faces one of them, and he says, "Now I have repented," nor for those who die rejecting Faith, for them We have prepared a painful punishment.
O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit the women of women, nor do they make it clear to you, except that you have given them a part of that which you have given them, and do not go out of them with a kind of kindness. And if you dislike them, it is better for you. And if you dislike them, it is better for you.
And if you wish to take a wife for another husband, then you have given them a portion of the wealth, then you will not return to it, and you will not return to it.
And how many things you have made for yourselves, and have taken a covenant from you, and have taken a covenant from you?
And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed before; indeed it is shameful and hateful, and an evil way.
It is your wife who has given you your wife, and your wife, and your wives, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and your wife, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and their wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And the women are the ones who possess your hands, that it is Allah's command that He has commanded you. It is not lawful for you except that they should consume your wealth, nor do you commit what you do not commit marriage, and that you may not commit adultery, except for the sake of their wives, for the charity of your wives; for you are a slave of Allah, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
And whoever has not given any woman among you who has not been given to any other woman, He has not given any of the people from among you; and Allah knows best those who are among you, and Allah knows best those who are among you, and those who are not of you are equal to one another; then give them permission to give their marriage to them, and give them what you fear.
God wants to make clear to you and to guide you in the ways of those before you, and to turn towards you, and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
God wants to turn to you in repentance, but those who follow their own lusts desire that you are far away from a great deviation.
Allah wants to lighten your burdens, and man was created weak.
O you who have believed, do not consume yourselves in the property of another, but trade by trade by mutual consent, and do not kill yourselves; surely Allah is the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
And whoever does injustice and injustice, We will soon cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the major sins that you are forbidden, We will remove your sins from you, and admit you to a noble place.
Do not covet what God has given you from among others. He has given you a portion of what they have earned, and the women have earned what they have earned, and the women have their portion; and God is aware of everything.

Tell them the story of the two sons of Adam, when they offered a sacrifice of the two of them, and they accepted the one who was not accepted from the other, and the other was not accepted from the other. And he said, "I will surely kill you, the God of the godfearing."
“If you stretch your hand against me to kill me, I will not stretch my hand to kill you, for I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”
I intend to forgive you of my sin and your sin, and you will be among the companions of the Fire, and it is the recompense of the unjust.
Then his brother killed him by his brother, so he killed him, and he was one of the losers.
Then Allah sent down a raven from the earth to show it to the land, he said, "Woe to me!" He said, "Woe to me, I am like a man who is like this." And he said, "Woe to me, I am like this, that I may be of the like of my brother."
“That is because We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless it is for manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it is as if he had killed all mankind, as if he had saved all mankind, as if he had saved all mankind, as if he had saved all mankind.
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.
Except those who repent before you overpower them, then know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek the means of nearness to Him and strive in His way, that you may be successful.
Indeed, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and the like of it with the like of it, it would not be accepted from them from the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them, and they will have a painful punishment.
They will wish to get out of the Fire, but they will not come from it, and they will have a humiliating punishment.
As for the thief, the thief, and the woman, cut off their hands as a recompense for what they have earned, and exemplary punishment from Allah; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
But whoever repents after his crime and does good deeds, then Allah will turn to him in repentance; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, He punishes whom He wills and punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills?
O Prophet! let not those grieve thee who dispute with you in disbelief; they say: We believe, and their hearts say: We believe, and their hearts have not come to you; and they are the Jews, and they are the Jews, and they are the Jews, and they are the Jews, and they are the Jews, and they are the ones who do wrong.
They listen to falsehood, and they have forbidden it; but if they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them, if they turn away from them, they will not hurt you, but if they turn away from them, judge between them with justice; surely Allah loves the doers of good.
And how do they judge with you until they have received the Taurat (Torah), that is the Taurat (Torah), which is in Allah's command; then they turn away after it, and they are not believers.
We have sent down the Torah, wherein is guidance and light, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the rabbis, and the Jews, and the Jews, and the Jews, and those who were given the Book, and those who have been given the Book, they were witnesses of the Book of God. Do not fear Me, and fear Me, and do not give My revelations a small price for a small price.
And We decreed for them therein in this life, a life for a life, and an eye for the eye, and the nose, and the nose, and the ear, and the tooth, and the tooth, and the wounds, and the wounds, and the wounds, and the wounds, that it may be for him, for that which Allah revealed, that they should be unjust.
And We sent forth in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him, and We gave him the Gospel, wherein was guidance and light and confirmation of the Law that had come before him and guidance and admonition for the righteous.
And the People of the Book may judge between what Allah has revealed, and that which Allah has revealed to them do not judge in the matter of the transgressors.
And We have sent down to thee (O Muhammad SAW) the Book (the Book), the Book (the Book), confirming the Book before it, and the truth of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), the Injeel (Gospel), etc.), and the truth (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.), and the truth (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.). And if He wills, He will make you taste of all that is revealed to you, and He will make you
And judge between them between what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires, but beware of them, lest they divert you from some of what Allah has sent down to you, but if they turn away, know that Allah is the One who has given them a recompense for their sins, and many of mankind are transgressors.
What is the matter with those who do evil, and they are better than the people who believe?
O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
You see those in whose hearts is a disease hastening towards them, saying, "We fear lest a misfortune befall us." Then, if a change should befall them, then Allah will bring them back, or they will be forgiven by what they conceal.
And those who believe will say, "Are these the people who swore by Allah by their strongest oaths?" Their deeds will be vain, and they will be losers.
O you who have believed! If any of you turns back from his religion, then Allah will bring a people who will love Him, and they will love Him, lowly, lowly, lowly against the believers, stern against the disbelievers, and strive hard in the way of Allah, and do not fear the censure of any censurer. That is the grace of Allah, He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
You are Allah, His Messenger, and His Messenger, and those who believe, and pay the prayer and pay the poor-rate, and bow down.
And those who take Allah and His Messenger and those who believe, then surely the party of Allah is the Party of Allah, the Mighty.
O you who believe! take not the unbelievers for those who have been given the Book before you and those who were before you, and do not take the unbelievers for their religion and the unbelievers, if you are believers.
And when you call to prayer, they take it as a mockery and fun. That is because they are a people who do not understand.
Say, "O People of the Book, do you resent us except for the sake of Allah, that we believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was sent down before, and that most of you are transgressors?"
Say: "Shall I inform you of something worse than the treatment of the treatment of Allah? those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, and those who worshipped them, and those who worshipped others, and those who worshipped Satan, those who worshipped Him, and are far astray from the way of the Most High."
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe"; but when they disbelieve, they are with the disbelievers, and Allah knows best what they hide.
And many of you see many of them in sin and transgression, and devour the devouring of their eating. Evil is what they do.
Why do they not forbid the rabbis and their rabbis and forbid the devouring of their possessions? Evil is what they do.
And the Jews said: Allah's hand is on hand, and their hands are on their hands; they have been cursed by what they said, but it is not in the hands of the two, but it is not in the hands of those who do evil, but that they may be in the right hand, and that which is revealed to them in the land, and that which is in the earth, it is Allah Who has revealed to them many of them. And Allah does not love the transgressors, and Allah loves the transgressors.
And if the People of the Book had believed and guarded (against evil), We would certainly have removed from them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of bliss.
And if they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and what has been sent down to them from their Lord, they would certainly have eaten from above them and from beneath their feet, and among them is a party of them. And many of them are a people who do evil.
O Messenger! deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord; and if you do it not, then you have not conveyed His message, and Allah will protect you from the people. Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
Say, "O People of the Book, you have no ground until you uphold the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good deeds, then they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
We took a covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent messengers to them. Whenever there came to them a messenger, they desired to follow it, but they rejected some of them, and they killed others.
And they thought that there would be no trial, so they became blind and deaf; then Allah turned to them mercifully, and many of them turned away; and many of them became blind; and Allah is Seeing of what they do.
Those who say, "Surely, Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary"; the Messiah said, "O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord."
Those who disbelieve say: "Allah is the third of the Three, and there is no god but He; there is no god but He; if they desist from what they say, there is a painful punishment for those who disbelieve."
Will they not turn back to Allah and seek His forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. Messengers have passed away before him; and his mother was a truthful woman. They ate food of food. See how We make the signs clear to them; then see how they turned away.
Say: "Do you worship besides Allah that which has no power to harm you or benefit you, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing."
Say: "O People of the Book! exceed not your religion in the religion of truth, trespassing beyond the truth, and follow not the desires of the people who went astray before, and have misled many of them, and have gone astray from the right path."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses.
They did not forbid one another of the iniquities which they committed; indeed evil is what they used to do.
You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which has been sent down before them. Evil is Allah's wrath upon them, and they will abide in the torment.
And if they had believed in Allah and the Prophet and what has been revealed to him, they would not have taken them for friends, but many of them are transgressors.
You will surely find the most hostile in the company of the Jews, and the idolaters, and the idolaters, and those who say, "We are Christians." And those who say, "We are Christians." That is because they are the ones who are of them, and they are not arrogant.
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you will see their eyes overflow with tears, because they recognize the truth, and they say: Our Lord! we believe, so write us down among the witnesses.
What is the matter with us that we should not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us, and that we may hope for our Lord with a righteous people?
So Allah has prepared for them for what they said, Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein, and that is the recompense of the righteous.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are companions of the Fire.
O you who believe! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you and do not exceed the limits; surely Allah loves not transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has provided for you, lawful and wholesome, and fear Allah that you are believers.
Allah has not sworn to you by an oath by your oaths, but that you may not have any oaths in your oaths, so that it may be for you that you may be divided in the land, and that which is in the wombs, that which is in the wombs, and that which is in the wombs, that it may be for you, that they may not be able to give the burden to the poor, or if they are in the land, so that you may be grateful.
O ye who believe! intoxicants and gambling, and divination and divination, are an abomination of Satan's handiwork; eschew the abomination of Satan, that ye may prosper.
Satan desires to excite enmity between intoxicants and gambling, and to cause enmity between you and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and of prayer. Will you then abstain?
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and if you turn away, know that Our duty is only to convey the duty of Our Messenger.
There is no blame for those who believe and do good deeds that they should have eaten from what they have eaten, and have faith, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do good deeds, and do good deeds, and do good, and Allah loves the doers of good.
O you who believe! Allah will surely test you with a favor which is with your hands and your lances, and that you may know that Allah knows what is in the unseen, and that whoever transgresses after him is a painful punishment.
O you who believe! There is not in the land, nor in the pilgrimage; and if you know any of you, then die, except for a single soul; then whoever is killed, then it is for you to fight for a person who is fighting against you, or to be cut off, or to be cut off, or to be cut into a state of good deeds, which is the recompense of what is done for you. And Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
It has been lawful for you to eat of the sea, and for it is for you, and for you for the pilgrimage, and for the pilgrimage for you, and for the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage, and the land is forbidden for you. Fear Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka’bah for the House of the Sacred House, and for the establishment and the establishment for the people, and the sacrificial month and the garlands, that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and that Allah is Knowing, Knowing.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message; and Allah knows what you conceal and what you conceal.
Say, "The good and the bad are not like the good, and the abundance of the abundance of the abundance of the abundance of the abundance of the abundance of the bad, so fear Allah, that you may be successful."
O you who believe! ask not about that which the truth has come to you, if it is clear to you, and if you ask about what is revealed to you, they will be disclosed to you. Allah has pardoned you, and Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
A people before you asked questions, but they disbelieved in it.
Allah has not forbidden a <unk>, or a Wasilah, or a Wasilah, or a Hami, and those who disbelieve fabricate lies against Allah; but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger," they say, "Sufficient for us is that which we found our fathers doing." Even though their fathers had no knowledge of knowledge, nor were they guided.
O you who believe! Take your own souls; you are the ones who follow the guidance, if you are guided, it will not harm you. To Allah is your return, then He will inform you of what you did.
O you who believe! when death comes to you, that is better for you, and two of you, in order that you may be in the land; but if you are in the land, you are in the land, and if you are in the land, then if you have any doubts, then if you have any doubts, then if you are witnesses, then if you have any doubts, then if you are witnesses, then you will be in the land.
But if it be discovered that they are guilty of the sin, they both have two of the two of them among the other, and they will swear by among the two of them, and they swear by Allah that our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed the limits, and We have not transgressed the unjust.
That it may be that they may be more truthful than their testimony, or their oaths after their oaths, and they shall fear their oaths, and fear Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust people.
On the Day when Allah will gather together the Messengers, He will say: What response did you answer?
And when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, "My father, the son of Mary, and his mother, and his mother, I will give you the spirit, and in it is a great place in the land, and when you have read the Book, I will bring it to you in a great place, and in the Book when I have given you the truth, then it is the matter of the <unk>, and it has been given to me in the sight of Allah." And when it comes to my Lord's command, it is clear to me. And when the Children of Israel go forth from My presence, it is said to them, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: We believe. Bear witness that we are Muslims.
And (remember) when the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord sent down to us from the heaven?
They said, "We want to eat from it, and to satisfy our hearts, and know that we have brought you the truth, and that you may be witnesses of the truth."
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven, to be a festival for the first of us and the last of us and the last of us. You are the best of providers."
Allah said: "I am sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW), but if you were among any of you after any of you, I will punish him with a severe torment, I will punish him with a torment."
And when Allah said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as gods besides Allah?' They will say, "Glory be to You, my Lord, I am not the truth of what is in my heart." And if it is said to him, "You will surely know what is in my heart, and what is in your heart, and I do not know what is in my hearts. You are the best of all things. You know what is in my heart, and I do not know what is in your hearts."
“Never said to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say, ‘Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’
If You punish them, they are Your servants; if You forgive them, You are the All-mighty, the All-wise.’
Allah will say: This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truthfulness; theirs are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall dwell therein forever. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are with Him; that is the great success.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and He has power over everything.
All praise is to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the light and the light; then those who disbelieve are equal to their Lord.
It is He Who created you from clay, then decreed for you a term, and a term for Him; then you doubt.
He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you publish, and He knows what you earn.
No Sign comes to them from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
And they denied the truth when it came to them, but the news of what they used to ridicule will come to them.
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, as We established in the earth as We had established in the earth, and We did not send down upon you the rain from the sky, and We caused them to grow in the sky, and We caused them to grow in the land, and We raised them into a generation after them?
And if We had sent down to you a book written on paper, and they touched it with their hands, the disbelievers would have said, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not an angel been sent down to him?" If We sent down the angels, they would have been decided, and they were not given respite.
And if We had made him an angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and they would have been confused with what they have done.
Messengers were mocked before you, but they mocked them at what they mocked.
Say: Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who rejected (the truth).
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "To Allah belongs the Mercy of Allah and He has decreed for Himself the Day of Resurrection.
And to Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall I take for you a guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, while He feeds it and does not provide sustenance for it?" Say: "I am commanded to be the first of those who submit (to Allah)."
Say: "I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a dreadful day."
On that day, whoever is averted from it, Allah has mercy on him, and that is the manifest achievement.
And if Allah visits you with affliction, none can remove it but He; and if He touches you with good, He is powerful over everything.
He is omnipresent over His servants, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.
Say to them, "What is the matter between you?" Say, "Sufficient for me is Allah, and you have a witness between me. And I have been sent down to you, so that you may warn those who are with you, and you will be warned to warn those who are in the presence of Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah. I do not testify to you." Say, "I do not bear witness to you."
Those to whom We have given the Book know it as they recognize their sons. Those who have lost their souls will not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or denies His signs? Surely the unjust will not be successful.
And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, We will say to those who ascribed partners (to Allah): "Where are your partners whom you used to assert?"
Then they will have nothing to say, “By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.”
See how they lie against themselves, and that which they invented has failed them.
And there are some of them who listen to you, and We have placed veils on their hearts, lest they understand their hearts, and deafness in their ears. And if they see every sign, they will not believe in it. And when they come to you, they will not believe in it. The unbelievers say, "These are nothing but tales of the ancients."
And they forbid away from it, and they turn away from it, and they destroy nothing but themselves, and they do not know.
And if you could see them when they are made to stand before the Fire, they will say, "Oh, would that we had been sent back, and we will not deny the signs of our Lord, and we will be among the believers."
Nay, they have been exposed to what they used to hide before, but if they were returned to what they were forbidden, they would surely have been forbidden, and they are indeed liars.
And they say: There is nothing but our life in this world, and we shall not be raised up again.
And if thou couldst see them when they are made to stand before their Lord, He will say, "Is this not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say, "This is the punishment that you used to disbelieve."
Those who have rejected the meeting with Allah, they are losers, until when the Hour comes to them, they say: Alas for us is what they neglected, and they will bear their burdens on their burdens, and their burdens will be their burdens.
And the life of this world is nothing but amusement and diversion; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, then do you not understand?
We know that they will grieve you, but they do not lie to you, but it is they who disbelieve in the communications of Allah.
Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient with their rejection, and they were persecuted until Our help came to them, until Our help came to them. There is no changing the words of Allah, and there has already come to you the messengers of the Messengers.
And if their turning away is hard for you, then if you seek a tunnel into the earth, or a ladder into the sky, or a ladder or a ladder to bring them a sign, and if Allah had willed, He would have brought them all together. So do not be among the ignorant.
Those who listen to Him will respond to Him, and Allah will resurrect them on the Day of Resurrection, and to Him will they return.
And they say: "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Allah has power over all things, but most of them do not know."
And there is no animal on the earth or a bird flying flying with its wings, but they are not like you, except as you are in the Book, and they will be gathered to their Lord.
And those who reject Our signs, are deaf and dumb, and in the darkness, whom He wills, and He whom He wills, He guides whom He wills.
Say: "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you suddenly, or the Hour, will you call upon other than Allah, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but He will call upon Him if He wills, and if He wills, He will remove what you call upon Him, and you forget what you associate with Him.
And indeed We sent messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW), but We seized them with hardship and hardship so that they might humble themselves (to Allah).
So when Our Torment came to them, they did not fall at themselves, but their hearts were hardened, and Satan made the evil-seeming to them for their deeds.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened to them the gates of all things, and they rejoiced in what they had been given, but when they were in the presence of Allah, We seized them with a while.
So the people of the wrong-doers were cut off, and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say: "Tell me, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed your hearts, who is a god other than Allah, who can bring it to you?"
Say, "Tell me, if the punishment of God comes to you suddenly, or openly, will you be destroyed?"
And We send not the Messengers to give good news, but to warn those who believe, and those who believe, and do righteous deeds, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our signs, they shall be punished by their punishment.
Say: "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the Unseen. I do not know that I am an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me, and I follow only what is revealed to me." Say, "The blind is blind, and you do not think."
And warn them (O Muhammad SAW) that they may warn those who fear their Lord (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), and they will have no guardian, besides Allah, that they may be Godwary.
And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening, seeking His countenance, and they will not have any account in their account, nor do they have any portion of their reckoning, nor do they have any portion of their reckoning.
And so We made some of them as some of them so that they may say: "Are these the ones among whom Allah has bestowed among us from among us?"
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: Peace be upon you, your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself; so if any of you does evil in ignorance, then if any of you does evil in ignorance and act righteously, then surely He is Forgiving, Merciful.
And thus do We explain the signs, and that the path of the wicked will be shown to the guilty.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah. Say: 'I do not follow your vain desires, I will not follow your desires, and I will not be of the guided.'
Say: "I am a manifest proof from my Lord, and you have denied it; you have not come to me with what you have been doing, and that is the command of Allah. He is the best of the truth, and He is the best of the judges."
Say: "If only what is in your homes, the matter would have been decided between me and me, and Allah knows best the unjust."
And with Him is the keys of the unseen; He knows none but Allah, and He knows what is in the land and in the sea; and there is no leaf but He knows it, but He knows it, but He knows it, and is not dry in the earth, nor anything else in the earth.
It is He Who takes your souls by night, and He knows what you spend on day, then He raises you up again, so that a term may be fulfilled for you, then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you did.
And He is the Exalted over His servants, and He sends over you guardians, and when death comes to you when death comes to you, Our angels will not die.
Then they will be returned to Allah, the True, the True, the All-Knowing, the All-Knowing, the All-Knowing.
Say: "Who delivers you from the land and the sea, when you call upon Him in humility and in secret, saying: "If He delivers us from this, we will certainly be among the grateful."
Say: Allah delivers you from it and from every distress; then you associate partners with Him.
Say: "It is He Who has sent down to you from above you stones from above you, or from your feet, or from your feet, or to make you taste of mutual parties, and to make you taste the violence of each other. See how We explain the signs, so that they may understand."
And your people have denied it, and it is the truth. Say, "I am not over you."
And for every time is a term appointed, and you will soon know.
And when you see those who dispute in Our signs, turn away from them until they engage in other talk; but if Satan causes you to forget, then do not sit in the matter of the wicked, after that, if you are of the unjust.
And those who guard (against evil) are not accountable for them except for the duty of their duty, so that they may be reminded of the Reminder.
And those who make their religion sport and amusement, and the life of the world, and the life of the life of this world, and remind them of the Qur'an, and remind them of the Qur'an, and remember the Qur'an: for they have no power over any, that they may have no protector, but they shall have a grievous chastisement.
Say: "Shall we call upon Allah that which does not profit us, nor harm it, and whom Allah has guided to us, then that we should turn back to Him in the footsteps of the Shaitan and the earth?"
And that you should establish prayer and fear Him, and to Him is the destination.
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth; and the day He says, "Be it," and it will be said to the truth, "Be it," and it is the truth that is on the Day of Resurrection, and He is the All-knowing, the All-knowing.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar: "Do you take idols for idols? I see you and your people in manifest error."
And thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who have certainty.
And when the night came upon him, he saw a star, and he said, "This is my Lord"; but when it set, he said, "I do not love those who do not love."
When he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "If my Lord does not guide me, I will surely be among the people who are astray."
And when he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my Lord; this is greater," but when it came, he said, "O my people, I am innocent of what you associate with Him."
I have turned my face to Him, who has created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the idolaters.
