The Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Day of the Lord of the Day
We worship Thee, and You are our aid.
Guide us on the right path.
The path of those whom You have favored, not of those who have evoked, nor of those who are astray.
Alif. Lam. Mim.
This is the Book in which there is no doubt; the guidance of those who fear Allah.
Those who believe in the unseen and establish prayer and spend out of what We have provided them.
And who believe in what has been sent down to you and that which was sent down before you, and they are certain of the Hereafter.
These are on guidance from their Lord, and it is they who are the successful.
As for those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
God has sealed their hearts and their ears, and on their eyes is a veil; and theirs is a great punishment.
And of the people are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers.
They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they beguile none except themselves, and they perceive not.
There is a disease in their hearts; so Allah has increased their disease, and theirs is a painful punishment for them.
And when it is said to them, "Do not make mischief in the earth," they say, "We are only reformers."
Nay! they are the heedless, and they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Shall we believe as the fools have believed?" They are indeed unaware of it, but they are not aware.
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe"; but when they are alone with their devils, they say: "We are with you; we were only mocking."
Allah mocks them, and He leaves them in blindly in their blindly blindly.
These are they who have purchased error for guidance, so their transaction has not been given them, nor were they guided.
Their likeness is like the one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, and they will not see.
They are deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return.
Or, as it is from the sky, which is darkness, thunder, thunder, and lightning, they press their fingers in their ears for fear of death. God encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning almost turned away from their eyes, when it covers them in it, and when it comes to them, they stand in it; and if Allah willed, their sight and their sight would have touched them; surely Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous.
Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky a canopy, and sends down rain from the sky, and brought forth fruits for you for your sustenance; so do not set up rivals to Allah.
And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Surah of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do it not, and you will never do it – then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, that theirs will be Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide therein; they will say, "This is what we had given us before." They will be given to them, "This is what we had been given before." They will have spouses, and they will abide therein forever.
Allah is not a gnat, but it is not for a gnat, but those who believe know that it is the Truth from their Lord; and those who disbelieve say: What is the matter with Allah? He causes many of them astray, and He guides many of them, and He causes many of them astray.
Those who break Allah's Covenant after it has been joined, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and do mischief in the earth; it is they who are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were dead and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will cause you to die, and to Him you shall be returned?
It is He Who created for you all that is on the earth, then He has made the heavens subservient to Himself, and He has made the heavens seven heavens, and He has full knowledge of everything.
And when your Lord said to the angels, "I am going to place a vicegerent in the earth," they said, "Wilt Thou place therein therein therein who will cause corruption therein and shed blood?" They said, "I know that which you know not." He said, "I know that which you do not know."
And He taught Adam all the names; then He placed them before the angels and said: "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names. But when their names were recited to them, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth? I know what you conceal and what you disclose."
And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam," but they prostrated themselves except Iblis, and he was arrogant, and he was arrogant.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the garden, and eat of it wherever ye please; but do not approach this tree, lest ye be one of the unjust.
Then Satan made them slip from it, and made it from them, and We said, "Get you down, you are enemies of one another." And for you there is a abode and a provision for the earth.
Then Adam received from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord turned towards him; surely He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
We said: Get down all of you from it; and whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, whoever follows My guidance, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.
But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they are the dwellers of the Fire, abiding therein forever.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant with you, I will fulfill My covenant with you, and fear none but Me.
And believe in what I have revealed to you, confirming what is with you, and do not be the first of those who disbelieve, and do not sell My revelations for a small price, and fear Me alone.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth.
And establish prayer and give zakah and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin the people to enjoin yourselves and forget yourselves while you recite the Book?
And seek help in patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humble.
Those who know that they are their Lord, and to Him they shall return.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above all nations.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall they be helped.
And (remember) when We saved you from Pharaoh's people who were afflicting you with severe torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.
And (remember) when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people while you were looking.
And (remember) when We appointed for Moses forty nights (for forty nights), and you took the calf for him, and you were unjust.
Thus We forgave you, so that you may be grateful.
And (remember) when We gave Musa the Book and the Criterion (of right and wrong), so that you might be rightly guided.
And (remember) when Moses said to his people: O my people! Lo! I have wronged you for your own calf; therefore turn your back to your Lord, and slay your sins; surely He is the best of you, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
And when you said: O Moses! we will not believe in you unless we see Allah manifestly. The thunderbolt overtook you while you see.
Then We raised you up after your death, that you may be grateful.
And We shaded you with clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails, saying: Eat of the good things We have provided for you. Eat not Us, for they wronged themselves.
And (remember) when We said: Enter this town and eat of it wherever you wish; and enter the gate in humility and enter the gate, and say: "We shall forgive your sins and do good deeds."
But those who were unjust to the wrong of them had changed it, so We sent down upon them a punishment from the sky, so We sent down upon them a punishment from the sky.
And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Strike your rock with your staff; and twelve springs gushed forth from twelve springs, and every tribe knew its drinking place; and do not act corruptly in the land, and do not act corruptly in the land.
And when they said, O Moses, we shall not be patient in the food of the Lord; so take thy face upon us, and bring forth their hair, and cover their ears and its ears, and bring forth their ears and its ears; He is the best of those who do not believe in Allah and the prophets, and He has made for them the power of Allah, and He has made for you the power of Allah, and He has made for you what you wish.
Indeed, those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good deeds, they shall have their reward with their Lord, and no fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you, and raised Mount Sinai above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you may be godfearing.
Then you turned away after it had not been for Allah's grace and mercy upon you.
And certainly you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath, and We said to them, "Be apes, despised."
So We made it as a trial for them, and those before them, and a reminder for those who guard (against evil).
And when Moses said to his people: "Allah commands you to slaughter a cow." They said: "Why do you mock us?" They said: "I seek refuge in Allah from the ignorant."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what she is." Moses said, "He is a cow, nor a cow, nor a young man." So what you command is what you are commanded.
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what it is." He said, "He is a yellow cow, a yellow cow."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what she is.
He said: "He said: "This is a cow, not a cow, nor the blood of the earth, nor the blood of the earth, nor any blemish." They said: "You have come to you." They said, "You have come to bring forth the truth, and they did not have any power."
And when you killed a man, then disputed in the matter, and Allah is clear to what you hide.
We said, "Strike it with a part of it. God brings the dead to life and shows you His signs so that you may understand."
Then after that, your hearts are hardened, as if they are like them, even though they are rocks, and there are rocks from which rivers flow, and some of them are water; and there are some of them who fear Allah, and Allah is not aware of what you do.
Do you think that you should have faith in Him, when a party of them should hear the words of Allah, when a party of them should listen to Allah, and then they became aware of it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when they meet each other with one another, they say, "Do you tell them what Allah has revealed to you, so that they may argue concerning your Lord?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they hide and what they declare?
And among them are some who do not know the Book, but they do not know the Book, but they only conjecture.
And woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, they say, "This is from Allah," so let them enjoy a small price for a small price, and woe to them for what they have earned.
And they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days." Say: Have you taken a promise from Allah, that Allah will not break His promise, or do you say about Allah what you do not know?
Nay, but whosoever earns evil, and his evil deeds will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.
As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, they are the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein forever.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (saying): "Worship none but Allah, and do good to parents, and to parents, and to the orphans, and to the orphans, and to the orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to men, and pay the poor-rate and the poor."
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you (O Muhammad SAW): "Do not shed your blood, nor turn your backs from your homes; then you were witnesses, and you were witnesses."
You will be among your people, and he will protect you from among his people, and some of his people; some of them have some of them; and some of them are some of them; and some of them are with you when they reach it, and it is not for you to bring them out of your hands; surely the punishment of this world is only in the life of Allah; and Allah is not aware of what you do.
These are they who bought the life of the world for the Hereafter, so their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And We gave Moses the Book, and followed him with a succession of apostles; We gave Jesus the son of Mary clear proofs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit.
And they say: Our hearts are in the sight of Allah; but Allah has cursed them for their unbelief, so they will believe.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming what was with them, and those before them were seeking the help of those who disbelieved, but when they came to them, they disbelieved in it; surely the curse of Allah is upon those who disbelieve.
Evil is that which Allah has sent down for them, but they disbelieve in their disbelief, grudging that Allah should send down His favour upon whom He wills of His servants, and they have incurred wrath from wrath; and for the unbelievers there is a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us." But they disbelieve in Him, and it is the truth confirming what is with them.
Moses came to you with clear proofs, and you worshipped the calf, and you were unjust.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you and raised Mount Sinai above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen to them, and they said: We hear not, we hear.
Say: "If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you specially, except for the exclusion of mankind, then wish for death if you are truthful."
And they will never wish for it for what their hands have sent before, and Allah is Knowing of the wrong-doers.
And you will surely find them more than the people of the world and the idolaters; each one of them wants to be a thousand years for him, and he is not able to save them from the punishment; and Allah sees what they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (Gabriel), he has sent down to your heart (the Qur'an) by Allah's Permission, confirming what was before it, and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe."
Whoever is an enemy of Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael, surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.
And We have sent down to you clear signs, and none will deny them except the transgressors.
And when they do not swear to them, some of them have a party of them; but most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming what they had been given, a group of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, though they were unaware.
They were followed by Satan, but they were not deceived by Satan, but Satan was not Satan, but the people of the world, and the people who were in the midst of the angels, and the people who were in the hands of the angels, and the people who were in the hands of the two men, and the people who were in the midst of the earth; and they had no power over them; but they had no power for them.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, they would have better reward from Allah, if they knew.
O you who believe! Do not say, "Do not say, "Unzurna," and say, "Listen to the words of Allah, and listen to the disbelievers."
The People of the Book, among the People of the Book and the idolaters, will not be sent down to any other than that of your Lord; and Allah chooses for His mercy whom He pleases; and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
“And if We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We bring a better or similar to it; do you not know that Allah has power over all things?”
Do you not know that Allah is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and you have no protector besides Him, or any helper?
Would you wish to question your Messenger before Moses? He who believes in it has strayed from the way of those who believe.
Many of the People of the Book wish that they would turn away from you after you have believed after it has become clear to them after it has become clear to them after it has become clear to them, so forgive them and forgive them; surely Allah has power over all things.
And be steadfast in prayer and pay the alms; and whatever good you send forth for your souls before you, you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah sees what you do.
And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." They are their own selves. Say: "Produce your proof if you are truthful."
Nay, but whoever submits his whole self to Allah, he is a doer of good, and his reward is his reward with his Lord, and no fear shall come upon them neither shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians have no right," and the Christians say: "The Jews are not the Christians." They recite the Book, and they recite the Book. They say: "Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ."
And who is more unjust than he who forbids the name of Allah in His name, and strives for their ruin, and strives for them therein? It is not for them to enter them in fear in this world, and in the Hereafter there is a great punishment.
To Allah belong the East and the West; therefore wherever you turn, then there is the Face of Allah; surely Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
And they say: "Allah has taken a son." He is the Most High, the Most High. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; all are Muslims.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees a thing, He says, "Be!" and it is.
And those who do not know say, "Why does Allah not speak to us?" Or a sign came to us, or a sign came to them. They say, "We are like their hearts. Indeed, We have explained to the people who are certain."
Verily We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) with the truth (i.e. the Qur'aan) with truth and as a warner, and you will not be questioned about the companions of the Blazing Fire.
And the Jews will not be with you, nor will they follow your religion until they follow your religion. Say: "Allah's guidance is the right guidance." And if you follow their desires, then you will have no protector besides Allah, nor will you have any protector.
Those to whom We have given the Book recite it to it, and it is the truth that they believe therein; and those who do not believe in it are the losers.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above all nations.
And guard yourselves against the Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall they be helped.
And when Abraham tried his Lord to test them, he fulfilled them, and He said, "I am going to make you a leader for mankind." He said, "I will not be of the unjust."
And (remember) when We made refuge for the people and a place for the people, and We made it a place of prayer in the place of Abraham, and We made Abraham a place of prayer for the House, and Abraham and Ishmael, and those who bow down and prostrate themselves and prostrate themselves and prostrate themselves.
And when Abraham said: My Lord! make this city a place of security and feed its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day. He said: "I wish to take a place of life for him, and I will take him in the Fire." How evil is the destination.
And when Abraham and Isma'il raised the foundations of the House, they said: Our Lord! accept from us; surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing.
Our Lord! Make us submissive to Thee, and appoint of our progeny a nation submissive to Thee, and Thou art the Grantor of Pity, and the wayfarer; surely Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.
“Our Lord, raise among them a Messenger from among themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and Wisdom and purify them.
And who is the one who desires to follow the religion of Abraham, except for him, and We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds."
And Abraham instructed his sons and his sons, saying: O my sons! Allah has chosen for you the religion; so do not die except as Muslims.
Have you ever considered the time when he said to his children, "Do you worship Me?" They said, "I will worship you, your God, Abraham, Isaac, Isaac, Isaac, and Isaac, and to Him we are Muslims."
That is a nation that has passed away; for them is what they earned, and for you is what you earned; and you will not be questioned about what they have earned.
And they say: "Become Jews or Christians, then you will be rightly guided." Say: "We follow the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say: "We believe in Allah, and that which was sent down to us, and what was revealed to Abraham and Isaac and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes and the tribes and the tribes and the tribes and the tribes and the Prophets and the prophets and the prophets, and all that was given to them from their Lord, and we are Muslims."
But if they believe as you believe, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, they are in schism; but Allah will suffice you against them; and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Allah is the One who is the One who is better than Allah, and who is better than Allah?
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you argue with us concerning Allah while He is our Lord and your Lord?
Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Ishaq and Ya'qub and Ya'qub were Jews or Christians? Say: "Do you know better?" And Allah is not aware of what you do, and Allah is not aware of what you do.
That is a nation who have passed away; for them is what they earned, and for you is what you earned; and you will not be questioned about what they have earned.
The people of the people will say, "What has the right to turn away from them?" Say, "To the east and the west." Say, "To the east and the west. He guides whom He wills.
Thus We have made you a middle nation, that you may be witnesses over the people, and the Messenger (Muhammad) is a witness against you, and the Messenger (Muhammad) has a witness over him; and that which We have decreed for you is only a witness for those who follow the Messenger and turn away from it; surely Allah is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
We see the turning of your face towards the heavens, so We will surely turn you to the qiblah of the Sacred Mosque; turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are wherever you are, they will surely know that it is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not heedless of what they do.
And to those who were given the Book, if you are able to follow their qiblah, they will not follow your qiblah, nor will they follow their qiblah, nor are they to follow their qiblah; surely if you follow their desires, then you are the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We gave the Book recognize it as they recognize their sons, and some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of the doubters.
And every one has a direction to whom he is going to turn away; then hasten to hasten in good works; surely Allah will bring you all together; surely Allah has power over all things.
And wherever you go forth, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; surely it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn away, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you turn away, turn your back towards your faces, and do not fear them except those who are unjust to you. Do not fear them, so that I may complete His favour upon you and that you may be guided.
Similarly We have sent among you a Messenger from among yourselves, rehearsing to you Our verses, purifying you, and teaching you the Book and Wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know.
So remember Me and I will remember you, and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek help in patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the patient.
And say not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive, but ye perceive not.
And We shall surely fear you with a fear of loss and hunger, and loss of wealth and fruits; and give glad tidings to the patient.
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: "We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return."
They are those on whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord, and those who are rightly guided.
Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah; and whoever performs the Sacred House, it is no fault in him; and whoever does good, it is no sin for him; and whoever does good, then surely Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knowing.
Those who have sent down the revelations and the guidance We have sent down after them, and We have made it clear to them in the Book, and the curse of Allah will curse them.
Except for those who repent and reform and make amends; I will turn away from them, and I am the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, they will be cursed by Allah and the angels and all mankind.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor shall they be reprieved.
And your God is One God; there is no God but He, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth, and the night, and the night, and the day, and the day, and the ships, and the ships, and the sea, and the sea, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, in the earth,
And among mankind are those who worship Allah, as they love themselves like Allah; and those who believe are in the love of Allah; and those who do wrong will see that they see the punishment; surely Allah is severe in punishment, and Allah is severe in punishment.
And when those who followed followed those who followed those who followed them, they will see the punishment and their ties are cut off.
And those who were followed will say, "If only we had been returned to what we had been doing, we would disown them as they have disowned us." So Allah will show them their deeds, and they will not be of the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is lawful in the earth and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your open enemy.
He enjoins you to do evil and indecency, and that you say about Allah what you do not know.
And when it is said to them: "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say: "We follow what we found our fathers following." Even though their fathers did not understand, nor were they guided.
And the example of those who disbelieve is like that of those who shouts to Him, who hears nothing but calls and cries; deaf, dumb, dumb, and blind.
O you who believe! eat of the good things which We have provided you and give thanks to Allah, if it is Him that you worship.
He has forbidden you only to eat, and flesh, and swine, and swine, and swine, and swine, and swine, and swine, and swine, nor transgressing, nor transgressing, nor transgressing, nor transgressing; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The People of the Book who have been sent down to the Book, and purchase a small price for it, they have no more than their bellies; Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and theirs is a painful punishment.
They are the ones who have purchased error in error, and for forgiveness for forgiveness.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book (i.e. the Qur'an) to the Book (i.e. the Book of Resurrection), and those who differ in the Book are in extreme error.
It is not your way of the East and the West, nor any good for the good, and the good, and the good, and the righteous, and the angels, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and those who are patient, they are the truthful.
O you who have believed! There has been prescribed for you in the power of war against the wife of the woman who has given birth to the wife of his wife, so that his brother's wife may be cut away, and it is lawful for him. It is a mercy from your Lord. This is a mercy from your Lord and a painful punishment.
O mankind, there is life in your life, that you may be godfearing.
"For one of you is death, when he has left any property, that he may leave any of his parents, and parents and relatives, according to reasonable usage; this is the duty of the righteous."
But whoever changes it after he has heard it, it is only the sin of those who alter it; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
But if anyone is forced to be guilty of a testator, or to make a distinction between the testator, there is no sin for him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard (against evil).
000.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 days of the day when ye shall be sick, or some of you who are sick, and those who are left on it, there shall be no burden on the feeding of the feeding of the poor; and whoever doeth good, it is better for him; and if you know what is good, it is better for you.
It is in the Qur'an that which is sent down to mankind, and it is a guidance to mankind, and it is a guide in which it is revealed, and it is a sign between those who follow it, and that there is a watcher between you on the Day of Resurrection, and that he may be a one of them who has guided Allah, and is sick for him.
And when My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed near to them: I hear the call of the suppliant when he calls upon Me; so let them believe in Me, and believe in Me: that they may walk rightly.
It has been lawful for you to commit your wives in the night that they may be a garment for you; they are a garment for you, and you are a garment for them; and you have been wronged, so that you may be averse to Allah; and He will not turn away from you, and you shall not go away from them, and you will not be able to approach them, but Allah makes clear to you the night and the clean of it. Thus do Allah make His command clear to you; so do not turn away from them and do not approach them.
And do not devour your property in the property of yourselves, and do not make it lawful for them to make it lawful for the people, so that you may know.
They ask you concerning the sun and say: "These are not for men, and for the pilgrimage for Hajj; and it is not for those who enter your homes in the houses, but it is good for you to enter their homes, and fear Allah, and fear Him."
"Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors.
And kill them wherever they are expelled; and turn away from them wherever they find you; but if they fight against you, they are worse than killing them; but if they fight you, then kill them; surely the punishment is due to the unbelievers.
But if they desist, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And fight them until there is no persecution, and religion is only for Allah; but if they desist, then there is no hostility except against the oppressors.

It is not for any human being that Allah has given him the Book and the Prophethood, and He will say to his people, "Worship Me and my Lord."
And He will not enjoin you to worship the angels and the prophets, but He will bring you to unbelief after you have submitted to Him.
And (remember) when Allah took the covenant of the Children of Israel (saying): "I have given you the Book and Wisdom, and then there comes to you a Messenger confirming what is with you, and you shall believe in him and help him."
But whoever turns away after it is the transgressors.
Do they seek other than Allah's religion? To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, and to Him shall they return.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "We have believed in Allah and what was sent down to us, Isma'il (Ishmael), Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya'qub (Moses), and the Tribes and the Prophets and the Prophets and the Prophets and the Prophets and the Prophets and the Prophets, and the Messengers and the Prophets, and the Messengers, and all of them.
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How will Allah guide a people who disbelieved after they disbelieved, and bore witness that the Messenger is true and the truth came to them? And Allah does not guide the unjust.
These are the ones on whom the curse of Allah is upon them, and the angels, and all of them all together.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
Except for those who repent and reform; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who disbelieve after their belief, and then increase in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted, and they are not the losers.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, it is not accepted for them from the earth, even though it should be accepted for them, and they shall have no helpers, and they shall have no helpers.
By no means shall ye attain righteousness unless ye spend out of that which ye love; and whatever ye spend, verily, Allah is Knowing of it.
All food were lawful for the Children of Israel, which was given to the Children of Israel that which was sent down before them. Say: "Bring the Torah, if you are truthful."
And whoever fabricates a lie against Allah, it is they who are the wrongdoers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) Hanifa (Islamic Monotheism), and he was not of the polytheists."
Verily, the first House (of worship) established for mankind was that at Makkah, blessed and a guidance.
There are signs in the signs of Abraham; and whoever enters it, it is safe to him; and whoever enters the House, it is safe for him; and whoever disbelieves, then surely Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you reject the signs of Allah?"
Say, "O followers of the Book, why do you prevent those who believe from Allah's way, seeking to prevent them from the path of Allah? But you are not aware of what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey a party of those who were given the Book, they would turn you back after you have believed.
And how will you disbelieve? How can you disbelieve in Allah's revelations and His Messenger? And whoever is in charge of Allah, He will guide you to a straight path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast to the rope of Allah, and do not be divided in yourselves; and remember Allah's favour upon you when you were enemies, and He made your hearts into your hearts; and you were brothers of the Fire, and you were saved by the fire, and He saved you from the fire, so that you may be guided.
And among you there shall be a party who invite to righteousness, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and it is they who are the successful.
Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs; for them is a great punishment.
On the day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will turn black, and those whose faces are black will be black to those whose faces are black. Then taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve.
And those whose faces are whitened, they will abide in God's mercy; they will abide therein forever.
These are the Signs of Allah which We rehearse to you in truth; and Allah does not wish to do injustice to any of the worlds.
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and to Him is all things.
You are the best of the righteous, and what is right for you, and forbid what is right, and forbid those who believe and believe in Allah and the Book.
They will not harm you except harm; if they fight against you, they will turn their backs against you, and they will not be helped.
There is no refuge in the people except by Allah, except for the people, and the people, and they will have to draw near to Allah's wrath; and for them is a curse from Allah, and that they may not disobey the prophets, and they will slay the prophets, and they will slay the prophets, and they are transgressors.
They are not all alike; there is a party of the People of the Book who recite the Signs of Allah during periods of the night and recite the prayer.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten in the way of righteousness; and they are the best of the righteous.
And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it; and Allah knows well those who are pious.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their properties nor their children will avail them against Allah; they are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein.
That which they spend in the life of this world is a likeness of the like of that which is kindled in the midst of the people who have wronged themselves, and it destroys it, and it is not for them to destroy it; but it is they who are wronged.
O you who believe! Do not take your friends other than your own selves; they will not be able to harm you in the way of you; they love the hatred of their mouths, and hide their breasts; surely it is greater to make clear to you the signs; surely We have made clear to you the communications.
You are those who love them, and they love you not, and you believe in the Book, and when they meet you they say: We believe in their rage. Say: Die in your rage; surely Allah knows what is in the breasts; surely Allah knows what is in the breasts.
If good befalls you, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls you, they rejoice at it, and if you are patient, their guile will not harm you. God encompasses what they do.
And (remember) when you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) entered your family in the morning to battle at the stations of battle; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
(Remember) when two parties against you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) was against you, but Allah was their protector; and the believers put their trust in Allah.
And Allah had helped you at Badr when you were weak, so fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
Remember when you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?"
Nay, but if you are patient, and fear Allah, and they will attack you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels.
And Allah did not send it except for good news and that your hearts may be calm to your hearts; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
That He may cut off a section of those who disbelieve, or abase them, so that they may turn away from evil.
There is no concern in your decision; He pardons them or punishes them; surely they are unjust.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth; He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He pleases; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that you may prosper.
And fear the Fire for those who disbelieve.
And obey Allah and the Messenger that you may receive mercy.
And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.
Those who spend (benevolently) in prosperity and hardship, and who restrain anger and pardon men; and Allah loves the doers of good.
And those who, when they have committed an indecency, or wronged themselves, remember Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins, and who forgiveth sins except Allah?
Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever; and how excellent is the reward of those who work!
Many have passed away before you, so travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a declaration for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for the pious.
And do not grieve, nor grieve, and you will be superior, if you are believers.
If a wound has touched you, it is the same of those who disbelieve, and We shall make them revert to the people of the people; and that Allah may know the believers and some of you from among you; and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test those who believe and reject the disbelievers.
Do you think that Allah knows not those who strive hard among you, and He knows those who are patient?
And indeed you wish for death before you have seen it, and you have seen it.
Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah. And if he dies, he is not of the Messengers; then if he dies, he will turn back on your heels; and whoever turns back on his heels, then surely Allah will not harm them, and Allah will reward the thankful.
And there is no death except by Allah's permission, except for a single soul; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him of it; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We shall give him thereof, and We shall reward him for a reward.
And how many a prophet has fought in Allah's house; so they did not become weak for them in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken; and Allah loves the patient.
They did not say, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our transgressions, and make our foothold firm, and protect us from the disbelieving people."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter, and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will be losers.
Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of helpers.
“Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined partners with Allah for which He had sent down no authority; and their abode is the Fire; and evil is the destination.”
And Allah has promised the promise of your promise, so that you should slay them, so that you should kill him, and argue in that wherein you have been given, and that you may differ in the matter of Allah, and that you may turn away from what you have been given, and He has made you successors from among you. He has made you successors from among you, and He has made you successors. And Allah is the Owner of the believers.
And when you turned away, there was no one for him, and the Messenger was calling you back from your rear, so He seized you from grief for grief, so that you might not grieve for what escaped escaped upon you, nor grieve for what befell you; and Allah is aware of what you do.
Then He made a veil for you (O Muhammad SAW) as a group of a group of a group of a group of a group of a group, and some of a group of a group of a group, and some of them were averse to their disbelief. They said, "What is it that you have been doing?" They said, "What is this for us?" Say, "We have been given what is in your homes. God knows what is in your hearts. God knows what is in your hearts. God knows what is in your hearts. God knows what is in your hearts. God knows what is in your hearts."
Those of you who turned back on the day when the two hosts met, Satan made them slip for some of them; and Allah has pardoned them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when their brethren should be travelling in the earth when they walk in the earth or they say, "If they had been with us, they would not have died, nor would they have been killed; so that Allah may make a regret in their hearts and die, and Allah sees all that you do."
And if you are slain in the way of Allah, then forgiveness from Allah and mercy from Allah are better than what they amass.
And if you die or die, then to Allah you shall be gathered.
So it was due to mercy from Allah that you deal with them gently; and had you been rough, hard hearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the affair; then when you have decided, then place your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, there is none who can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, then who can help you after Him?
And there is not for any prophet any prophet, nor will he disobey him with what he has earned; then every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who followeth Allah's pleasure like he who draws away from Allah's wrath, whose abode is Hell, and evil is the destination?
They are grades of God, and God sees what they do.
God did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and Wisdom, while before that they were in manifest error.
And when a calamity befell you when you were afflicted twice twice you were afflicted with a twice twice. Say: "This is from your own selves; surely Allah has power over all things."
And what befell you on the day when the two armies met with Allah's leave was made by the believers, and that He might know the believers.
And He said to the hypocrites, "Come to fight in Allah's cause, or fight in the way of Allah." They said, "If we had been forbidden to war, we would certainly have been given you." They will say, "We have been nearer to you." They say, "In the way of Allah, what is in their hearts, and Allah knows what they hide."
They are those who say to their brothers, "If they had been given us, they would not have been killed." Say: "Avert death from death, if you are truthful."
And do not think of those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive, provided their sustenance with their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them by His bounty, and those who are behind them, for those who are behind them, and those who are behind them, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the grace of Allah and His blessings; and Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger after Allah had given them a great reward, and for those of them who do good, theirs is a great reward.
Those to whom the people said: "Verily, the people have gathered against you, so fear them," but they increased their faith, and they said: "Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the Best of Guardians."
So they returned from Allah's grace and grace; no harm touched them; and they followed the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty.
It is Satan who frightens you, so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And let not those who disbelieve fall into disbelief for those who disbelieve; they will not harm Allah at least they will not harm them in the Hereafter; and for them is a great punishment.
Those who purchase disbelief for their disbelief will not harm Allah, and theirs is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for them; We grant them respite only for their sins; and for them is a humiliating punishment.
It is not for Allah that you should cause the believers to turn away from it; and Allah does not know the evil of the evil-doers; but Allah knows what He pleases of the unseen, and He chooses His messengers whom He pleases; so believe in Allah and His Messengers.
And let not those who do not think that what Allah has given them of His grace is better for them; it is better for them that they are niggardly; nay, it is worse for them to be niggardly on their necks on the Day of Resurrection and their necks on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah is aware of what you do.
Allah has heard the saying of those who say: Allah is the Most Gracious, and we are rich for the rich and we are rich for what they have said, and We shall say to the prophets, "Taste the punishment of the Fire and taste the punishment."
This is because of what your hands have sent before, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.
They say: "Allah has promised us that we should not believe in any messenger unless he brings us a sacrifice." Say, "Messengers before you have come to you with clear proofs and with which you have come to the fire." Then you did slay them, if you are truthful.
But if they reject you, they were Messengers before you, who came before them with clear proofs and scriptures, and the Book of Enlightenment.
Every soul will have a taste of death; and you will not be paid your only reward on the Day of Resurrection; then whoever is admitted to the Fire, he is admitted to the Garden, and the life of this world is but the enjoyment of the world.
You shall surely be tested in your wealth and in your souls, and you will surely hear from those who were given the Book before you and from those who were given the Book. But if you are patient, and fear Allah, then surely it is the matter of the matter.
And (remember) when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book (i.e. the Qur'an) to make it clear to mankind, and it was not plain to mankind that they threw their backs (their backs), so they threw their backs in their backs, so that they would turn away from their backs, and it is evil for them.
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have been given, and that they should be praised for what they have not been given, and do not think of them the punishment of the punishment; for them is a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah has power over all things.
The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day, are signs for those who understand.
Those who remember Allah, standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): "Our Lord, You have not created this in vain.
Our Lord! You whom You admit to the Fire, You have disgraced him, and there is no helpers for the unjust.
O our Lord! We have heard the call of a caller calling to faith: "Believe in your Lord," and we have believed, so forgive us our Lord, and forgive us from evil.
Our Lord! You have promised us what Thou hast promised us through Thy Messengers and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection; surely Thou wilt not break the promise.
So their Lord answered them: "I shall not be among you any human being, nor of you, nor of you, nor of you, nor of you, and to take place for you from your homes; and I will place for you from your homes, and I will admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and that which is in the garden, will be the reward of Allah; and Allah is the best of the best."
Let not the earth deceive you in the land.
That is a brief enjoyment, and their abode is Hell, and evil is the destination.
But as for those who fear their Lord, they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow; therein they shall abide therein for ever; and that which is with Allah is the best of the righteous.
And there are some of the People of the Book who believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to you, and that they have been sent down to those who have been sent down to Allah; they have no small price in the communications of Allah; they have their reward with their Lord; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! Endure in patience and remain steadfast and remain steadfast, and fear Allah that you may prosper.
O mankind! fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and from him created his mate, and from his mate, and from many men and women; and fear Allah in Whom you demand one of your rights, and the wombs of the wombs; surely Allah is Witness over you.
And give the orphans their wealth, and do not exchange it for good, and do not devour their property for their property; surely this is a great sin.
And if ye fear that ye shall not marry the orphan, if ye marry one of your wives, or two, or four, or four; or if ye fear that ye shall not be able to do justice; but if ye fear not, it is better for you; that is that which ye do not.
And give the women their dowries as a gift; but if they remit any of you, they will consume it with wholesome appetite.
And do not give your wealth to the poor, that Allah has made for you a provision which He has made for you, and brings them out of it, and clothe them with gentle words.
And marry the orphans until they are given them; then if you find them in the right hand, then give them their property; and do not eat of them, and do not fear them; and for the poor, it is for them; and whoever is good for them, then let him take care of their property; and Allah is sufficient in need.
That is what the property of the parents and the property of his parents, and the wives of their parents, and the wives of their parents, or the women, or the women, or a small number.
And when the orphans and the orphans and the needy are needy, give them out of it, and speak to them honourable words.
And fear those who fear them, if they were weak offspring, they would fear them; so let them fear Allah, and speak words of righteousness.
As for those who consume the wealth of the orphans, they will consume their bellies in their bellies, and they will roast in Hell.
Allah has prescribed to you your sons, that he may marry two wives for their wives, and the wives of their wives; and if they marry, it is better for them; and it is not for them that he may bring forth his wife, except for his wife; and if it is written for them, then there is no blame for them except for the sake of Allah; and if it is decreed for them, then there is no blame for them from Allah; surely Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And your wives have been given to you that He has taken for them a son, and if a son had taken a son, he would have given him a son, and if he had taken a child, he would have given them wives, and if you have not taken a child, then there is no one who has taken away from them; and if you have a child, then there is no blame for them except for what you have been given, or for what you have been given; and if you have a child, then there is no blame for them.
These are the limits of Allah; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever; and that is the great attainment.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, and transgresses His limits, He will admit him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful punishment.
And those of your wives who are guilty of lewdness, bring four witnesses against you from among them; and if they testify, confine them to the houses until death overtakes them, or Allah ordain for them a way.
And for those of you who are guilty of indecency, kill them both; but if they repent and amend, turn away from them; surely Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
Allah accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance, and then repent of their sins; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil, until death faces one of them, and he says, "Now I repent," nor of those who die while they die. We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit the marriage of your wives; nor do you make them clear to them that you may have given them a part of that which you have given them, and do not turn away from them, so that you may not be able to harm them; surely Allah is good for what you do.
And if you wish to take one another for another, and do not have given a portion of them in the least, then do not turn away from it, and do not turn away from it, and do not commit evil.
And how can you take out of what you have earned, and have taken a covenant from you?
And marry not women whom your fathers married, except for what has passed before; surely it is shameful and hateful, and an evil way.
It is your father who has given you your wife, and your wives, and your wives, and the women, and your family, and your family, and your family, and your family, and your family, and your mothers, and your spouses, and your spouses, and your spouses, and your spouses, and your wives; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And your wives are only those whom your right hands possess, except for Allah's permission; and it is written for you, except for them, except for your property, and do not commit adultery except for your wives; for you have given your wives as a marriage for them; for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And those who do not marry among you who are in the hearts of the believing men, the men of the hearts of men, will be among those who have believed, and Allah knows well those who are faithful, and He knows best those who are faithful to you; and if you do not give them a share, they will not be able to marry them except for what is due to them, and you shall not be able to kill them; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
God desires to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and He will turn to you in mercy, and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
Allah desires to turn to you, and those who follow their lusts wish that you should deviate far away.
Allah wants to lighten your burden, and man was created weak.
O you who believe! Do not devour yourselves in the property of yourselves, except by mutual consent of your own selves; and do not kill yourselves; surely Allah is Merciful, Merciful.
And whoever commits aggression and transgression, We shall cast him into Hell, and that is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the major sins which you have been forbidden, We will remove your sins from you, and admit you to a noble place.
Do not covet what Allah has given you above others; for men is a share of what they earn, and for women is a portion of what they earn; and Allah has full knowledge of all things; surely Allah is Knowing of everything.
And We have made heirs of all of his parents and kinsmen, and those who have made a covenant with those whom you have made with your covenant; surely Allah is Witness over everything.
Men are the children of Allah; He has made some of them excel others from among others; and they spend their wealth in their wealth, and that they may spend the good women, and the women who are careful of the piety of Allah, and those who do not know them, do not take them out of their hands; and if they obey you, they will not have touched them; surely Allah is Mighty, Merciful.
And if you fear a breach between them twain, appoint him from his family from his family and from his family, if they wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation; surely Allah is Knowing, Aware.
And worship Allah, and do not associate with Him any partners, nor do your parents, and the orphans, the orphans, the orphans, the orphans, the needy, the companion, the companion, your companion, and your companion, and your companion, and the wayfarer; surely Allah loves not the arrogant.
Those who are niggardly, and enjoin the people, and enjoin out of what Allah has given them of His bounty, and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, and they do not believe in Allah and the Last Day; and whoever is Satan, he is an evil companion.
And what was it that they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spend out of what He has given them, and Allah knows what they have earned?
Allah does not wrong the atom's weight of injustice; but if any good is good, He doubles it, and gives him a great reward.
How will it be when We bring forth from every nation a witness, and We bring you as a witness against them?
On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were buried on the earth, and they will not be able to hide it from Allah.
O you who believe! Do not approach prayer until you speak to yourselves, unless you know what you say, and you will not go forth except your backs, and you shall find it, or you are sick, or if you are sick, there is no one of you or you, and you are the one who is the <unk>, and your hands, and your hands; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, purchasing error, and wish to turn away from you from the Right Path?
And Allah knows your enemies, and Allah is sufficient as a protector; and Allah is sufficient as a protector.
Those who have been given to the Jews, they have been given to them, and they will not be able to talk about them, and they will say, "This is better." They will say, "We have listened to you," and they will be able to say, "This is better for them." But Allah has cursed them for their unbelief, so that they may not believe.
O People of the Book! Believe in what We have sent down to you, before We turn away from them, before We turn away from them, and We turn them away from their backs, and We cursed them as We cursed the Sabbath.
Surely Allah does not forgive that partners should be set up with Him, but He forgives anything else for whom He wills.
Have you not seen those whom they say, "Nay, but Allah wills whom He wills." They will not be wronged, nor will they be wronged.
See how they forge a lie against Allah, and that is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book that they had been given the Book and Satan, and those who disbelieve say, "These are better than the believers who are guided?"
They are those whom Allah has cursed, and whom Allah curses, you will not find for him any helper.
Is there any one of them in the kingdom, so that they may not be able to give the people a little more?
Or do they envy the people because of what Allah has given them of His bounty, so We gave to the Children of Abraham the Book and the Wisdom, and We gave them a great kingdom?
There are some of them who believe in the Book, and some of them turn away from it; and sufficient is Hell.
As for those who disbelieve in Our revelations, We shall cast them into Hell; as often as their skins are roasted, We shall change them for some skins, so that they may taste the punishment; surely Allah is Mighty, Wise.
As for those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. These are spouses, and We shall admit them to deepening shade.
Allah commands you to judge with your trusts, and when you judge between people judge between people, surely Allah is the best of what you do.
O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those among you who have been given authority, but if you dispute in Allah and the Last Day, then if you believe in Allah and the Last Day, then it is better for you, and it is better in the sight.
Do you not see those who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what has been sent down before you, and they wish to reject the Shaitan (Satan) to whom they have been commanded?
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites turning away from you from aversion.
How is it that when evil befalls them because of what their hands have sent before, and they will come to you swearing by Allah, "We do not wish to speak good and conciliation?"
They are the ones whom Allah knows what is in their hearts; so turn away from them and admonish them, and speak to them a word to speak.
We did not send any messenger except that he should follow Allah's permission; and when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you, and asked forgiveness of Allah and His Messenger, and asked forgiveness for them, surely Allah is Ever Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.
And if We had said to them: "Kill your homes," or from your homes, some of them would not have done it; but if they had done what they had been given, they would have better better for them, and they would have a great faith.
And We gave them a great reward from Us.
and guided them to a straight path.
And those who obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) will be with those whom Allah has bestowed on His Grace, the Prophets, the martyrs, the martyrs, the martyrs, and the righteous.
This is the bounty of Allah; and Allah is Knowing, Knowing.
O you who believe! take your precautions, then go forth in companies, or go forth in companies.
There is one of you who lag behind, so if a misfortune befalls you, he says: "Allah has blessed me with that I have not been present with them."
And if good fortune comes from God from you, he will surely say, as if there had no affection between you and him: "Would that I had been with them, I would have achieved a great success."
Let them fight in the life of Allah for those who sell the life of this world, and whoever fights in Allah's way, or is killed, or he is slain, We shall surely give him a great reward.

Except for those who have been given a covenant with you, or have a covenant with them, or to fight with you in a way that they may fight against you or their people against their people; and if Allah had willed, He would have made them prevail over you.

They will find a group of you who wish to seek refuge in Him and from His people, and when they turn to Him, they will fall into it, and they will turn away from it, and do not turn away from it, and do not turn away from your hands, and kill them wherever you drive them; and We have given you a clear authority.
It is not possible for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) except for the believers that there is no sin except for Him, and from Him who believes in Him and his progeny, and when you turn away from your family, then if you turn away from your wives, then it is incumbent upon the faithful and the believers and the believers and the faithful; and if there is a covenant between you, it is incumbent upon them.

The Jews and the Christians say: "We are the sons of Allah and His beloved." Say: "Why do He punish you for your sins?

That is why We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless it is for manslaughter, and in the earth, it is as if he slew all mankind; and whoever saves all mankind, it is as if he had saved all mankind; and indeed, Our Messengers came to them with clear proofs, and indeed, after them, many of them are transgressors.
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.

They listen to those who listen to falsehood, but if they come to you, then judge between them, or turn away from them. But if they turn away, they will not hurt you. And if you judge between them, judge between them with justice. Indeed Allah loves the doers of good.
And how can they judge with you that they should judge with Allah? That is what the Taurat (Torah) is in the Taurat (Torah); then they turn away from it; and they are not believers.
We sent down the Torah wherein was guidance and light, and the prophets and the prophets, and the prophets, and the rabbis, and those who were given the Book and were witnesses to the Book of Allah. So do not fear Me, and fear Me, and fear Me not for a small price. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down, surely they are disbelievers.

And judge between them concerning what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their vain desires; fear them lest they beguile you from some of what Allah has sent down to you. And turn away from them for their sins. Indeed, the people are transgressors.
Do they want to seek the command of Allah? He is better than a people who are better than Allah.

O you who believe! Do not take for those who were given the Book those who were given the Book before you and those who were given you, and do not take the unbelievers as friends for you, so fear Allah, if you are believers.

Say: "O People of the Book! do you disapprove of us that we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and that which was sent down to us and that which was sent down before?
Say: "Shall I inform you of something worse than that of Allah? those whom Allah has cursed by His wrath, His wrath, His wrath, and those whom He has made apes, and those whom He has made apes, and those who are far astray, are worse than those who are far astray."
And when they come to you, they say: "We believe"; but they are with those who disbelieve with their unbelief, and Allah knows best what they hide.
And you see many of them in sin and transgression, and in the unlawful, and the unlawful, and what they do is evil.
Why do they not forbid the rabbis and the rabbis, and forbid their devouring of their property? Evil is what they do.
And the Jews say: "Allah's Hand is on hand"; their hands are niggardly, and their hands are cursed by their hands; but it is not except for them that they are niggardly in the hands of their hands; and that which is revealed to them, it is for Allah's sake; and it is not for those who disbelieve in Allah and the earth, and Allah does not love the mischief.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would have absolved them from their sins and admitted them into Gardens of bliss.
And if they had believed in the Torah and the Gospel and that which was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have taken out from above them and from beneath beneath beneath beneath them; and some of them are a party of them; and many of them are evil.
O Messenger, deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and if you do not, you have not delivered His message; and Allah will protect you from the people; surely Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.
Say: "O People of the Book! ye shall not stand unless ye uphold the Torah and the Gospel and the Gospel which has been sent down to you from your Lord; and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, He will surely increase many of them in their inordinacy; surely the unbelievers do not grieve."
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We sent Messengers to them, whenever a Messenger came to them with what they desired, and some of them were impostors.
And they thought that there is no sin, so they became blind, and they became blind; then Allah has turned away from them, and many of them became blind; and Allah sees what they do.
Surely they say: Surely Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary, and the Messiah said: O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.
They are those who say: Surely Allah is the third of those who are partners; there is no god but He; there is no god except Him; if they do not desist from what they say, there is a painful punishment for those who disbelieve.
Do they not turn to Allah and seek His forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger; many of them passed away before him; and his mother was a truthful woman; and his mother said to them: Look at the signs.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which has no power to harm you or benefit you? And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Say, "O People of the Book, do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor follow the desires of those who have gone astray before, and have misled many of them, and have strayed from the Right Path."
Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, Jesus son of Mary, because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses.
They did not forbid one another, for what they did.
You see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which their souls have sent before them, so that Allah will be displeased with them and they will abide therein forever.
And had they believed in Allah and the Prophet and that which was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends; but many of them are transgressors.
You will surely see the people of the Jews and the idolaters, and those who are faithful to those who are faithful, and those who say, "We are those who are Christians, and those who say, 'We are those who are the ones who are the ones who are among them, and they are not arrogant.'
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you will see their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the truth; they say: "Our Lord! we believe, so write us down among the witnesses."
And why should we not believe in Allah and the Truth which has come to us, seeing that our Lord will admit us among the righteous people?
And Allah has rewarded them with Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide therein forever. Such is the reward of the righteous.
But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they are the companions of the Fire.
O you who believe! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress limits; surely Allah does not love the transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has provided for you, lawful and good, and fear Allah in Whom you believe.
Allah has sworn to you by a covenant in your oaths, and that you may not have any oaths in your oaths, and that you may take it away from that which is in your hands, so that they may not be able to eat of the women, except that the women may feed it, or let them take hold of it; and do not bear witness to Allah for His command.
O you who believe! intoxicants and gambling and divining arrows and divining arrows are Satan's handiwork; so avoid them, so that you may prosper.
Satan desires to stir enmity between you and gambling, lest you turn away from Allah and the remembrance of the Remembrance and from the remembrance of Allah. Will you then abstain?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger; and if you turn away, then know that your duty is only to convey the duty of the Noble Messenger.
There is no blame on those who believe and do righteous deeds, that they may have no sin in the past, but they fear, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds; and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! Allah has given you some of your own hands and your lances, so that Allah may test him who fears Him in secret. And whoever transgresses after him, he is a painful punishment.
O you who believe! Do not enter in the land, nor do you know of it; and for those who know him, then He is the one who has killed you, except for a group of you who fight against one another, except for a party who is fighting against you, or let him die in the sight of Allah; and Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
It is lawful for you to eat of the sea, and to eat it for you, and for the needy and for the wayfarer; and you are forbidden to the land for which you are forbidden; and fear Allah is to Whom you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah the Ka'bah for the Sacred House, and the Sacred House, and the Sacred Month, and the Sacred Month, and the Sacred House, and that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth; and Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message; and Allah knows what you hide and what you hide.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The hypocrites are not the best of the good and the good, but the abundance of the abundance of Allah, so fear Allah, so that you may prosper."
O you who believe! Do not question about what is clear to you if it is clear to you, and if you ask about what is revealed to you, they will be disclosed to you. Allah has forgiven you, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
A people before you asked him, and then they disbelieved in it.
Allah has not forbidden a camel, nor a camel, nor a camel, or a Hami, and a lie, and a lie for those who reject Allah.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," they say, "Sufficient for us is what we found our fathers doing."
O you who believe! Guard your own souls. If you are guided, there will not harm you any harm. To Allah is your return. He will inform you of what you did.
O you who believe! If one of you is dead, then We bring you two hundred of the two of you; but if you wish to travel in the land, then you are one of them; and if you doubt, then the death of you is death, and if you doubt, they will not be able to give any benefit for them; and if they are in doubt, they will not be able to swear by Allah; surely Allah bears witness that they are sinners.
But if it had been discovered that they are guilty of those who are guilty of the wrong of their wives, they are two among those who have taken their homes from among themselves, and they swear by Allah: "Our testimony is truer than our testimony, and we have not transgressed, and we are not of the unjust."
That it may be better that they should be able to bear witness to their oaths, or their oaths will be after their oaths; and fear Allah, and listen to Allah, and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
On the Day when Allah will gather together all the Messengers, He will say: "What did you answer?" They will say: "We have no knowledge. You are the Knower of the unseen."
And when Jesus, son of Mary, said: "The son of Mary, I will give you his mother, and his mother, and your mother, and I will give you the strength of a people in this world and in the earth, and I will recite it to you in the Book, and I will recite it to you in the Book, and I will bring you out of the Book of Allah, when the people of the Children of Israel say, "This is nothing but obvious magic." And when you have come to Me, those who disbelieved with you have come to you with clear proofs, and those who disbelieve will come to you.
And when I said to the disciples, "Believe in Me and My Messenger," they said: "We believe and bear witness that we are Muslims."
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord able to send down to us a table from heaven?" He said, "Fear God, if you are believers."
They said: "We wish that we may eat of it, and satisfy our hearts, and know that we have spoken to you the truth, and that we may be of the witnesses."
Said Jesus, the son of Mary, "O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table [spread with food] from heaven, that it may be for us to be a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You.
Allah said: "I will send it down to you, but if you turn away from him, I will surely punish him with a severe punishment in the world."
And when Allah said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind: 'You have no other gods besides me, and my mother, and my mother?' They will say, "Glory be to you! I know that I am truthful. I know what is in my hearts, and I do not know what is in your hearts. You are the All-Knowing, the All-Knowing."
Never said to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say: worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness over all things.
If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say: This is the day on which the truthful will profit their truthfulness; theirs will be Gardens underneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him; this is the great success.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and He has power over all things.
All praise is due to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made light and light; then those who disbelieve are equal to their Lord.
It is He who created you from clay, then decreed a specified term, and a term of Him is a specified term.
And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you earn.
No sign comes to them from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
Indeed, they denied the truth when it came to them, but the coming of the Hour will come to them.
Do they not see how many a generation We destroyed before them, whom We had established in the earth, whom We had not given you? We have given them abundant rain from the sky, and We made the rivers flow beneath them, so We destroyed them for their sins, and raised after them a new creation.
And if We had sent down to you a Book on paper, and they touched it with their hands, those who disbelieved would have said, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not an angel been sent down to him?" If We sent down an angel, they would have been given it, and they would not be reprieved.
And if We had made him an angel, We would have made him a man, and We would have made them as confused as they have confused.
Messengers before you were mocked, but those who mocked them were encompassed by what they mocked.
Say: "Travel in the land and see how was the end of those who denied (the Truth)!"
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "To Allah belongs the provision for whom He has made mercy. He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection wherein there is no doubt.
To Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall I take for myself other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He feeds and gives sustenance for His sustenance." Say: "I am commanded to be the first of those who believe, and do not be of the polytheists."
Say, "I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a great day."
On the day when it is averted from him, Allah has mercy on him, and that is the manifest achievement.
And if Allah afflicts you with affliction, there is none who can remove it except Him; and if He touches you with good, He has power over all things.
He is Omnipotent, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.
Say: "What is the greatest among them? Say: "Allah has a witness between me and you." Say: "Allah has sent down a witness for you. He has sent down to you the Qur'an. Do you not say, "There is no god but Allah, and you are the partners of Allah."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their sons, but those who have lost their souls will not believe.
Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or denies His signs? Surely the unjust will not prosper.
On the Day when We gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah: "Where are your partners whom you used to assert?"
Then they will not be asked to say, "By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists."
See how they lie against their idols, and that they will turn away from them.
There are some of them who listen to you, and We have made their hearts veils in their hearts, and We have ears to understand their ears; but if they see each of them, they will not believe in it. Those who disbelieve will come to you with clear arguments. Those who disbelieve say, "These are nothing but tales of the ancients."
And they turn away from them, and they turn away from them, and they only destroy themselves, and they do not perceive.
And if you could see when they are made to stand on the Fire, they will say, "Would that we had been sent back, and we would not reject the Signs of our Lord, and we are believers."
Nay, it is that which they used to hide before them; but if they were returned to them, they would surely have been forbidden to it, and they are indeed liars.
And they say: There is nothing but our life in this world, and we shall not be raised up again.
And if you could see when they are made to stand before their Lord, He will say, "Is this not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say, "Taste the punishment of your disbelief."
Those who reject Allah's meeting with him are losers, until the Hour comes upon them, and they say, "We have neglected what we used to earn." They will be their backs on their necks, and they will be their backs.
And the life of this world is naught but amusement and diversion; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, then do you not understand?
We know that they say that which they say grieves you; it is not you that they deny, but the signs of Allah are the liars.
Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient, and they were patient, and they were patient until Our help came to them. There is no changing the words of Allah.
And if their aversion is hard for you, then if you can seek a tunnel into the earth, or a ladder in the sky, or bring them a sign, then bring them a sign; and if Allah had willed, He could have guided them all, so do not be of the ignorant.
Those who listen to Him, they will be called to Him; and Allah will resurrect them on the Day of Resurrection.
And they say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "God has power over them; but most of them do not know."
There is no creature crawling on the earth, nor a bird flying on its wings, but they are like you as you are. We have not neglected anything in the Book, and to their Lord they shall be gathered.
And those who reject Our Signs are deaf and dumb, and in darkness, whom He wills; and whomsoever He wills, He leaves astray whom He pleases.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah is upon you, or the Hour (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), should you invoke besides Allah, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but He will call upon Him, and He will remove whatever you call upon Him, and you will forget for Him what you associate with Him.
And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW), and We seized them with poverty and hardship, so that they might humble themselves.
So when Our punishment came to them, they did not humble themselves, but their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their deeds seem fair.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened them to the gates of all of them, and We seized them with what they had been doing; so they were in despair.
So the wrong-doers were cut off, and all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered: if Allah should take away your hearing and your sight and set your hearts into your hearts, who is there other than Allah besides you?
Say: "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly, or openly, will it be destroyed except for the unjust people?"
And We sent not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and warners; so whoever believes and reforms, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
As for those who reject Our revelations, they will suffer for their punishment.
Say, "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen." Nor do I say to you, "I am an angel." Say, "I do not follow except what is revealed to me." Say, "The blind are equal to the blind, and you do not understand."
And warn them (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) that they may come to their Lord (i.e., the Day of Resurrection), that they may have no protector besides Allah, and (that) they will have no protector besides Allah, and that they may guard (against evil).
And turn not away from those who call upon their Lord morning and evening; they will not be able to turn away from their hands, nor are they responsible for them for account of their deeds; and if you turn away from them, then you will turn away from them, and you will be among the unjust.
And We have made some of them some of them so that they may say: "Are these the ones whom Allah has bestowed upon us?" And Allah does not know those who do not know.
And when those who believe in Our Signs come to you, say: Peace be upon you, your Lord has prescribed mercy upon Himself; so if any of you does evil in ignorance, then then he will surely be kind to you, and thereafter, then He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Thus do We explain the revelations, so that the way of the criminals will be clear.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I have been forbidden to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah." Say: "I do not follow your vain desires; I would not follow your vain desires, and I am not of the rightly guided."
Say: "I am a clear proof from my Lord, and you deny him a liar.
Say: "If I had been in your hearts, it would have been decided between me and me; and Allah knows best the wrong-doers."
And with Him is the keys of the unseen; none knows Him except Him; and He knows what is in the land and in the sea; and there is no leaf but He knows it, and there is no grain in the darkness of the earth, nor is it a dry thing in a book that is in a clear Book.
It is He Who takes your souls by night, and He knows what you have done in the day; then He raises you up in the midst of a specified term; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you did.
He is the One over whom He has power over His servants, and He sends guardians over you when death comes to you when death comes to you, and they do not take away.
Then they will be returned to their Lord. He is the only Judge, and He is the swiftest of reckoning.
Say: "Who delivers you from the land of darkness and sea, when you call upon Him in humility and in secret?" Say: "If He delivers us from this, we will surely be grateful."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah rescues you from it and from every distress.
Say: "He is Able to send you from above you stones from above you, or from beneath your feet, or He will divide you into sects and make you taste some violence of others. See how We explain the revelations."
And your people have denied it, and it is the truth. Say: I am not a keeper over you.
And every time for every specified time, and you will know.
And when you see those who engage in Our revelations, turn away from them, turning away from them; but when they follow any other discourse, then do not sit in the company of those who do wrong.
And those who fear Allah is not responsible for their deeds; so that they may be godfearing.
And (O Muhammad) have made your religion as a sport and play for them, and the life of this world is the life of this world, and the Qur'an is a reminder for those who have passed away. There is no protector besides Him, and there is no protector for him. There is no protector besides Him, and a painful punishment for them.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do we invoke besides Allah that which does not profit us nor harm him, and who has been guided after Allah has guided us?
And perform prayer and fear Him; it is to Him that you shall be gathered.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth, and the day He will say, "Be!" and it is. His word is the truth, the day, the Trumpet, the Trumpet, the Trumpet, the All-Knowing.
And (remember) when Ibrahim said to his father Azar: "Do you take gods as gods?
Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might be of those who have certainty.
And when the night came upon him, he saw a star; he said: "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said: "I do not love those who do not love."
And when he saw the moon rising, he said: This is my Lord; but when it set, he said: "Unless my Lord does not guide me, I will surely be among those who are astray."
And when he saw the sun rising, he said: This is my Lord; this is greater than this; but when it set, he said: "O my people! I am innocent of what you associate with Him."
“I have turned to Him (Allah), the One who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of those who associate partners with Him.”
And his people disputed with him, saying, "Do you argue with me about Allah that He has guided me, and that I should not fear what you associate with Him? I fear that my Lord will not wish to understand. So do you not remember?"
And how should I fear those whom you associate with Allah? Do you not fear that you have joined partners with Allah for which He has sent down to you no authority? But if you know, then the two parties will be better.
As for those who believe and do not believe, it will be safe for them, and they are rightly guided.
And this is Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people; We raise in degrees whom We will; surely your Lord is Knowing, Knowing.
And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya'qub, and We guided each of them, and We guided him, and his progeny, and Sulaiman, and Sulaiman, and Solomon and Aaron and Aaron and Aaron; thus do We reward those who do good.
And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias; each one of them was among the righteous.
And Isma'il, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot, and all of them We preferred above the nations.
And their fathers and their spouses and their brothers, and We chose them and guided them to a straight path.
Such is the guidance of Allah, He guides whom He wills of His servants.
These are the ones whom We gave to the Book and the Prophethood and the Prophethood; but if they do not believe in it, We have made it a people who reject not.
These are the ones whom Allah has guided, so follow their guidance. Say: "I do not ask for you any reward for it. This is a reminder for the entire world."
And they did not have accepted Allah's covenant with Him that they said, "Why did He not have sent down a miracle from Allah which He has sent down?" Say: "This is the Book which Moses has sent down, and the guidance of the people which you have been given, and the guidance which you have been given, and that which you did not know."
And this is the Book which We have sent down before it, confirming what was before it, and that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it, and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are called to prayer.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or says, "I am sent down to Me," and it has been revealed to him that he should say: "I am sent down to Allah and I sent down to you what He has sent down," they will say, "I have sent down to you the Book and the punishment, so that you may turn away from their hands, and you will have a great punishment."
And indeed you have come to Us as We created you first, and left behind you what We have given you, and We do not see you with your intercessors, and We do not see your intercessors with you that you asserted.
It is Allah Who brings forth the date of the date and the date from the dead, and brings forth from the dead from the living from the dead. This is Allah, how are you turned away?
It is He Who makes the dawn overtake it, and He has made the night for rest and the sun and the moon; this is the Mighty, the Knowing.
And it is He Who has made the stars for you, that He may guide you in the darkness of the land and the sea; surely We detail the signs for a people who understand.
It is He who has created you from a single soul, then there is a place of refuge and a place of refuge. We have explained the signs for a people who understand.
It is He Who sends down water from the sky, then We produce for it all kinds of fruits and plants, from which We produce fruits from which We produce grains of palm trees and vineyards and pomegranates and pomegranates and pomegranates and pomegranates and pomegranates and pomegranates and pomegranates and pomegranates and pomegranates; surely in this are signs for those who believe.
And they set up partners with Allah, that He created them, and He created them with knowledge, and He created them with knowledge and daughters; and He is exalted above what they do.
He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth; how can He have a son, and He has no consort, and He created all things, and He has knowledge of all things.
Such is Allah, your Lord; there is no god but He, the Creator of all things; therefore worship Him; He is the Guardian of everything.
No vision can grasp Him, but He comprehends the vision, and He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Indeed, there has come to you proofs from your Lord; so whoever sees it, it is for his own soul; and whoever does not see, it is for his own loss; and I am not a watcher over you.
Thus We explain the revelations to them, and they say, "You have studied," and that We may make it clear to the people who know.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord; there is no god except Him; and turn away from the polytheists.
And if Allah had willed, they would not have associated others with Him; and We have not made you a watcher over them, and you are not a guardian over them.
Do not abuse those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they abuse Allah in spite of their ignorance, and We have made for them a fair thing for their own deeds; then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
They swear by Allah by their strongest oaths that if a miracle came to them, they will surely believe in it. Say: "Signs of Allah is with Allah." But if they had believed, they will not believe in it.
And We will turn their hearts and their eyes, so they will not believe in it before the first time, and We will leave them blindly in their transgression blindly.
And had We sent down to them the angels, and the dead had spoken to them, and We had gathered all things before them, they would not believe unless Allah willed, but most of them are ignorant.
And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy from among the jinn and jinn, seeking each other in order to deceive each other in speech, and had your Lord willed, they would not have done it.
And so that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with it, and that they may do what they are doing.
"Shall I seek other than Allah as a judge? It is He Who has sent down to you the Book (i.e. the Book) to whom He has sent down to the Book (the Qur'an) and the Book (the Qur'an).
And the word of thy Lord is true in truth and in justice; None can change His words; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from Allah's way.
Surely your Lord knows best who has strayed from His Path, and He knows best those who are rightly guided.
If you believe in Allah, then you are the ones who believe in Allah.
And what is it that you do not eat of the Name of Allah which He has forbidden for you? He has made plain to you what Allah has forbidden for you, and He has forbidden many of them who have strayed from their own desires; surely your Lord knows best the transgressors.
And turn away from sin and sin; for those who do wrong shall be recompensed for what they used to earn.
And do not eat of that which Allah's name has not been mentioned; surely surely it is a sin for the Satans, and the Satans inspire you to argue with them; and if you obey them, you will surely be polytheists.
Is he that We give life to him, and We have made a light for him who walks in his midst, whose likeness is like he who walks in darkness in the darkness of darkness, and it is not for those who disbelieve?
And thus We have made in every city the criminals that they may conspire therein, and they will conspire therein against themselves, and they do not perceive.
And when a sign comes to them, they say: "We will not believe in it." They will not believe in that which Allah has given to us. God knows best those who have wronged him, and a severe punishment will befall them.
And whomsoever Allah wills, He opens his breast to Islam; and whomsoever He wills, He makes his breast clear to him, and He makes clear to him his breast, and He does not turn away from the sky.
And this is the right path of your Lord; We have indeed explained the signs for a people who believe.
For them is the abode of their Lord, and He is their protector, for what they used to do.
And on the day when He will gather them all together and say, "O people of jinn, you have made many of them in the company of the people." They will say, "Our Lord, we enjoyed some of others." He will say to them, "Your abode is Hell. You are the Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Knowing."
Thus do We make some of those who are unjust to the wrong-doers.
O assembly of Adam and jinn! Did not there come to you Messengers from among yourselves, relating to you My verses and warned you of the meeting of this Day of yours? They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves and the life of this world," and they were witnesses.
That is because your Lord will not destroy the towns unjustly while their people are unaware.
And all of them are degrees according to what they do; and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
And your Lord is full of mercy and mercy; if He wills, He will destroy you, and will appoint you as successors for your successors, and He will appoint for you a new creation.
Indeed, that which is promised you will come to pass, and you will not escape.
Say: "O my people! Work for your own work; surely I am acting in your deeds; surely you shall know that the abode of the Hereafter is in the Hereafter; surely the unjust will not prosper."
And they assign to Allah a share of the crops and cattle of which He has created, and they say, "This is for Allah," and they say: "This is for Allah, and this is for our partners."
And indeed, for those of whom Allah has made the covenant of those who associate partners with Allah, their sons have made their hearts fair, so that they may destroy them and their religion, and they would not have done it, so that they would not have done it.
