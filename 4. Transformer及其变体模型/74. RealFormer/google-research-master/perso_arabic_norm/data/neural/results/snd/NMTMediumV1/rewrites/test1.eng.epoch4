Allah the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Judgment.
We worship Thee, and You ask for help.
Guide us to the straight path.
The path of those with whom You have bestowed favors, not of those who have incurred wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.
Alif Lam Mim.
“This is the Book, there is no doubt about it, for the fear of Allah is the pious.”
Those who believe in the unseen, establish the prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
And believe in what has been revealed to you, and what has been sent down before you, and they are certain in the Hereafter.
These are the guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.
Verily, those who disbelieve, whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has set on their hearts their hearts and their seal, and their eyes are a veil, and theirs is a great punishment.
And some of mankind say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers."
They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive none but themselves.
There is a sickness in their hearts, so Allah increased their disease, and they will have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them: Make not mischief on the earth, they say: We are only peacemakers.
Indeed, they are the corrupters, but they are not the corrupters.
And when it is said to them: "Believe as the people have believed," they say: "Shall we believe as the fools have believed?"
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe," but when they are alone with their devils, they say: "We are with you; we are only with you."
Allah mocks them and they will have their power in their rebellion.
They are the ones who have purchased guidance for guidance. Their wealth will not profit them, nor will they be guided.
Their likeness is like the one who kindled the fire; then when the fire came to pass around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness.
Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return.
Or as a rainstorm from heaven, wherein is darkness, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder. And Allah encompasses the unbelievers, and Allah encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning takes away from their eyes, but when they are covered with it, they are in it, and when they are fixed, they would have been fixed in it; and if Allah had pleased, their eyes would have opened their eyes; surely Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may be godfearing.
Who has made the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky, and sends down water from the sky, and brought forth fruits for you for your sustenance; then do not associate anything with Allah, then do not associate anything with Allah.
And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our Servant (Muhammad SAW), then produce a chapter like it, and call your witnesses witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do not do it, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good works that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow; they will say, "This is what we have been given before us." They will say, "This is what we have been given before before us." They will be given them, and they will be given fruit.
Allah is not ashamed of anything of them, nor of them, as a gnat, but that they may know that it is the truth from their Lord. But those who disbelieve say: "This is a sign of Allah." And those who disbelieve say: "This is a sign of Allah." And most surely they will say: "This is a sign of Allah." And most of them do not follow it.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread mischief on the earth, they are the losers. These are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless, and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you to life, and to Him you will be returned.
He it is Who has created for you all that is in the earth, then He has made the heavens subservient to them, and He has made seven heavens, and He has knowledge of all things.
And when your Lord said to the angels, "I am going to make a vicegerent in the earth," they said, "Do you find in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed Your praise?"
And He taught Adam all the names of all things, then He placed them to the angels, and said: "Tell me the names of these if ye are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to Thee, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-Knowing, the All-wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." But when He informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I am the Knower of the heavens and the earth? I know what you reveal and what you reveal."
And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam," but they prostrated themselves, but they disbelieved, and he refused to be of the unbelievers.
And We said, "O Adam, dwell with your wife and your wife, and eat of it wherever you will, but do not approach this tree, lest you become of the wrongdoers."
Then Satan caused them to go out of the land, and We said to them, "Go forth from the land," and We said, "Go to the one who is one of another, and for a journey for you."
Then Adam received his Lord's word, and his Lord relented towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
We said: "Go forth from all things, all of you; but if you have a guidance from Me, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the dwellers of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you, and fulfil My covenant upon you, I will fulfill your covenant with you, and fear Me, and fear Me.
And believe in what I have sent down to you, confirming what is with you, and do not deny it, and do not exchange My signs for a small price; and fear Me alone.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor do you know the truth.
And establish the prayer and pay Zakah and bow down with those who bow down.
So do you enjoin the people with good, and seek you? Do you have a Book of the Book? Will you not then understand?
And seek help in patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult for the humble.
Those who think that they will meet their Lord, and to Him will they return.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above the nations.
And fear the Day when there will be no avail for another, nor will it be accepted from it, nor will it be accepted from it, nor will they be helped, nor will they be helped.
And (remember) when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who were afflicting you with great torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
And (remember) when We parted the sea for you, and We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, and you saw the people of Pharaoh.
And (remember) when We took for Moses forty nights, then you took a calf after him, and you were unjust.
Then We forgave you so that you may be grateful.
And (remember) when We gave Moses the Book and the criterion, so that you might be guided.
And when Moses said to his people: "O my people! Lo! ye have wronged yourselves by a calf, so turn your backs to your Lord. So turn ye back to your Maker. He is the best of your creation. He has mercy on you. Lo! He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And (remember) when you said: "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah."
Then We gave you death after your death, so that you may be grateful.
And We sent down upon you the shade, and We sent down with you manna and quails, saying: Eat for you good things for which you have provided good things, and they will not have wronged Us.
And when We said, "Enter this city, and eat from it wherever you wish, and enter the gate, and say, ‘Forgive us our sins, forgive your sins, and do good.'
Then those who wronged the wrong-doers said to them, "We have prepared for the wrongdoers a plague from heaven, and We sent down from the heaven a grievous punishment."
And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, "Strike your staff with your staff." Then twelve springs gushed forth from each people. Each people said, "Eat from Allah and do not commit corruption in the land, and do not commit corruption in the land."
And they said, "O Moses, do not let us be patient, do not let us be put out from your Lord. Our Lord is the Lord of the earth, and of His hands, and of His creatures, and of His creatures, and of His creatures, and of His creatures, and of His creatures, and of His creatures, and of His creatures, He created us."
Surely those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you and raised above you the Mount, (saying): Hold fast that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off.
Then you turned back after it were not for the grace of Allah and His mercy, if you would have been of the losers.
And you were aware of those among you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and hated."
So We made it a sign for the people of the towns and the people of the towns, and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
And when Moses said to his people, "Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Are you mocking us?" He said, "I am the God of the ignorant."
They said, "Call us to your Lord for us." He said, "It is a cow," he said, "It is not like a cow, nor is there a cow, and that you may be commanded."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make it plain to us." He said, "It is a yellow cow." He said, "It is a yellow cow."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what is like us; and if Allah wills, we will surely be guided."
He said, "It is said, ‘It is a cow, so that you may not be able to eat the earth, nor do the tree of the garden have come to you.' They said, ‘You have come to you.’ They said, ‘You have come to come, and they will not be able to kill.’
And when you slew a man, then disputed about it, and Allah will bring forth what you used to hide.
Then We said, "Strike the body of the cow, so that Allah may bring life to life, and He shows you His signs, so that you may understand."
Then, after your hearts, your hearts are hardened, and they are like a small rock; and there are some of them who are watered with water; and there are some who are watered with water, and some of them are afraid of Allah. And there are some of them who fear Allah, and Allah is not heedless of what you do.
Have you ever considered that you should have faith in the religion of those who believe in Him, so that some of them will hear the word of Allah? Then they will have knowledge, and then they will have knowledge.
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe," but when they meet each other with each other, they say: "Do you tell them what Allah has revealed to you?" They will say: "Do not tell you what Allah has revealed to you."
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?
And among them are some of them who know not the Scripture, but they do not know it.
So woe to those who write their hands to the Scripture, they say: "This is a sign from Allah, so let them have a small price for a small price." So woe to them for what their hands have earned, and woe to them for what they do.
And they say: "The Fire shall not touch us for a few days." Say: "Have ye taken a promise from Allah?" Say: "Have ye taken a promise from Allah, or that Allah will not fail His promise?"
Nay, those who do evil deeds and their sins are the inmates of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.
And those who believe and do good works, these are the dwellers of Paradise; they will abide therein forever.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, "Do not worship other than Allah, and give parents to parents and to the orphans and the needy and the needy, and speak to the people, and establish the prayer, and pay the poor-rate, and pay the poor-rate."
And (remember) when We took compact with you, saying: "Do not shed blood nor your people from among your people, and you will be brought forth from your homes."
Then you will be driven away from his people, and from his people there are a people from whom there are some people; each one of them will help each other, and some of them will have some of them; and if they will, they will have some of them. They will have some of your own souls, and they will have a share for you. They will have a share for you in the life of the Day of Resurrection. They will have a share for you in this world, and you will not be able to believe in the Day of Resurrection. But Allah is not unaware of what you do.
They are the ones who buy the life of this world for the life of this world, so they will not be helped, nor will they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book and followed him after him, and We gave Jesus the son of Mary with clear proofs and strengthened them with the Holy Spirit. And when a Messenger came to you with a Messenger, he would not be able to harm your hearts, and some of you were liars.
And they say, "Our hearts are wrapped in their hearts; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief."
And when the Book came to them from Allah, confirming that which came with them, before them, they sought to help the disbelievers, but when they had come to them, they disbelieved in it; then Allah is the curse of those who disbelieve.
This is because of what is evil for those who have sold their souls in Allah's religion, that they may disbelieve in Allah. That Allah will send down His mercy from whom He will of His servants. So they have incurred wrath against their wrath; and the disbelievers will have a disgraceful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what has been sent down to us."
Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, and you took the calf after the calf, and you were wrongdoers.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you and raised above you the Mount: "Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen to those who said, ‘We hear and hear," and their hearts disbelieved in their hearts. Say, "We hear not and reject what you believe." Say: "This is what you believe."
Say: "If the home of the Hereafter is for Allah, then there is no fear for mankind, if ye speak truth."
And they will not wish for it for their own deeds; and Allah knows best the wrongdoers.
And you will find them more than the people of the people and the polytheists. Each one of them will wish for a thousand years; and there will be a thousand years. And there will be no escape from him from the punishment, and it will not be averted from him; and Allah sees what they do.
Say: "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, he has sent down to you the Book from Allah, confirming what is before it, and a guidance and good tidings for those who believe."
“Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His Messengers and Jibreel and Michael, then verily, Allah is the enemy of the disbelievers.”
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) clear Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and none will deny them except the transgressors.
And when they heard it, it will be a party of them; but most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah, confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Book behind the Book of Allah behind the Book of Allah behind behind their backs.
Those who follow the footsteps of the devils were cast down by the devils; and it was not for them to disbelieve in the devil, but they disbelieved in the magic of the people, and they were not able to believe in the magic of the people, and they said to him, "We are only one of the people who have gone away from the earth." They will not be able to follow them, and they will not be able to follow them, and they will not be able to follow them, but they will not be able to be able to do anything.
If they had believed and feared Allah, they would have been better better than Allah, if they knew.
O you who believe! Do not say, "Do not say, ‘Do not speak,’ and say, "Listen to the unbelievers." And the disbelievers will have a painful punishment.
The People of the Book among the People of the Book have not among the people of the Book, nor among those who associate others with Allah. But Allah chooses whom He will for whom He pleases; and Allah chooses for whom He pleases.
“And to those who abrogate a verse, or do not cause us to be forgotten, or We do not bring it forth or do not know that Allah is Able to do all things.”
Do you not know that Allah is the One Who is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth?
Have you asked of your Messenger to ask about what was before Moses? But whoever believes in the religion of faith, he would have strayed from the way of the way.
Many of the People of the Book wish to follow you after they have believed after you have believed after it has become clear to them from their hearts. But pardon and overlook, and overlook and overlook; and pardon Allah. Allah has power over all things.
And establish the prayer and pay the poor-rate, and whatever good you have sent before you, you will find it with Allah; surely Allah sees what you do.
And they said: "No one shall enter Paradise unless they are the Jews and the Christians." They say: "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Nay, whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is good, he will have his reward with his Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews say: "The Christians are not the Christians, and the Christians say: 'The Jews have not been taken down to the Jews.' And they recite the Book of the Book; they say: "Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection."
And who is more unjust than he who prevents the mosques of Allah in His name, and strives for them to ruin their ruin? But they will not cease except for their fear except in fear; for them is disgrace in this world, and they will have a grievous punishment.
To Allah belongs the East and the West; so whosoever turns away, Allah is the Owner of the East; surely Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
And they say: "Allah has taken a son." Glory be to Him! Glory be to Him, in the heavens and the earth. To Him belongs all praise.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees it, He says, "Be!" and it is.
And those who do not know that Allah will say, "Why do not bring us a sign?" But they will not come to them in the sight of those who were before them. They said, "These are the hearts of those who are before them. Indeed, those who are before them say, ‘We are like a sign.'
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the dwellers of the Fire.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor will the Christians follow your religion. Say: "This is the guidance of Allah." Say: "The guidance of Allah is with you." And if you follow their desires follow their desires, you will have no protector or helper.
We have given the Book to those who have been given the Book to recite it. They believe in it. They believe in it. Those who believe in it will be losers.
O Children of Israel! call to mind the favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above the nations.
And fear the Day when no soul will be paid to another soul, nor will compensation be accepted from him, nor will they be helped, nor will they be helped.
And when Ibrahim (Abraham) tried his Lord with certain words, he said, "I am going to test you." He said, "I am going to make you a leader of the people." He said, "My children will not be successful."
And (remember) when We took a covenant from Allah and his people, and We made him a place of worship for Abraham, and We enjoined Abraham and Ishmael, saying, "Purify My House for those who are near to the House and those who are near to those who are needy."
And when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this a City of security and provide its people with fruits, for those who believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said, "I will give him a portion of this world; then I will give him a portion of the Fire, and I will make him taste the punishment of the Fire."
And when Ibrahim and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House, they said, "Our Lord, accept this from us; You are the All-Hearer, the All-knowing."
Our Lord, make us submissive to Him and make our offspring submissive to Him, and grant us our mercy, and forgive us our sins. You are the All-forgiving, the All-merciful.
Our Lord, send among them a Messenger from among themselves who will recite to them their verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And who is more astray than he who follows the religion of Abraham, except him in this world, and We made him in this world, and in the hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Submit,” he said, "I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds."
And Abraham instructed his sons and Jacob, saying: "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you the religion of Allah, so do not die except as Muslims.
Or did you come when death came to you from the dead? When he said to his sons, "What will you worship after me?" They said, "We will worship Allah, your God, the God of your fathers, Abraham and Isaac, the God of your fathers, and we are Muslims."
A people have passed away from what they have earned, for what they have earned, and that you will not be questioned for what you used to do.
And they say, "Be Jews or Christians, you will be guided." Say, "We follow the creed of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say: "We believe in Allah, and that which was sent down to us, and that which was sent down to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes of the Children of Israel, and that which was given to Moses from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between any of them.
And if they believe in you, then they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, they are in schism; and Allah will suffice you against them against them; and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
It is Allah's way, and who is better than Allah, and who is better than Allah?
Say: "Do you dispute with us about Allah? He is our Lord and your Lord, and for us are your deeds and your deeds.
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Jews, or the Christians, or the Christians, or the Christians? Say: "Are you better than Allah?" Say: "Are you better than Allah?" And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
This is a community that have passed away, so that they will be rewarded for what they have earned, and you will not be questioned for what they used to do.
The people of the people will say: "Have they observed them?" Say: "How did they turn away from them?" Say: "To Allah belong the East and the West, and He guides whom He will to a straight path."
Thus We have made you a just nation, so that you may be witnesses over the people, and that the Messenger may be witnesses against you, and that none of you may turn away from the Messenger; but whoever turns away from the way of the Messenger, he turns away from his heels; and whoever turns away from the way of Allah, he turns away from his heels. Verily Allah is the All-clement, the Merciful.
We will turn your face towards you from heaven. We will surely turn you to the qiblah of the Sacred Mosque. So turn your face towards your face, and turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are, turn your face towards the people of the Book. They know that their Lord is the truth.
And as for those who have been given the Book, they would not follow you, nor would they follow your qiblah; nor do they follow them from their own ways; and they will not follow them, and they will follow them after the knowledge of their desires. And if you follow them, then you are the wrongdoers.
Those who have given the Book to them know that they are their sons; and some of them know that they are the liars.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.
And every one of them will be guided to him, so that they may be better in the best; wherever Allah will bring you, Allah will bring you together; surely Allah has power over all things.
And if you turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. That is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And if you turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your faces towards them, so that none of them may have no fear except against them. Do not fear them, except those who have wronged you. Do not fear them, so that I may complete My favor, and that you may be guided.
Similarly, We have sent among you a Messenger from among you who recites Our revelations to you and purify you and teaches you the Book and wisdom and teaches you that which you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek patience and prayer, for Allah is with the patient.
And do not say to those who are slain in the cause of Allah, "They are dead; nay, they are alive, but you do not perceive."
And We shall test you with a measure of hunger and hunger and lives and lives and lives, and give glad tidings to those who give glad tidings.
When a disaster strikes them, they say: "We belong to Allah, and to Him we shall return."
They are the ones who have mercy on their Lord and mercy, and it is they who are the guided.
And the Safa and the Marwah are the signs of Allah. And whoever enters the house of Allah, let him be no more in the least; and whoever does good, it is not for two months; and whoever does good, Allah is All-Knowing, All-knowing.
Those who follow the truth and the guidance after that which We have sent down to them, We have sent down in the Book a clear portion of them, and curse them against Allah, and curse them against them.
Except for those who repent and do good deeds, to them I will have mercy, and I am the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, Allah will curse them with the angels and the angels.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.
And your God is One God, there is no god but He, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
To Him belongs the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the day, and the day, and the sea, and the sea, and the sea, and the sea, and that which is in the sea; and that which has been given down water from the sky, and that which is in the earth, and that which is in the earth, and that which is in the earth, and that which is in the earth, and that which is in the earth, and that which is in the earth, and that is in the midst of Allah.
And among men are those who take others besides Allah, as they love Allah. And those who believe in Allah love themselves in strength. And those who do wrong, when they see the punishment, they will see the punishment, and Allah is severe in punishment.
And those who followed those who followed others, and they will see the punishment, and they will be among them, and they will be among them, and they will not be imprisoned.
And the Hour will say to them, "If we had returned to us, we would surely have disowned them." But Allah will have their deeds their deeds, and they will have their deeds, and they will not be of the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is in the earth and eat of the footsteps of Satan. Do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your enemy.
He enjoins you to harm evil and indecency, and that you do not know what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has sent down," they say, "We follow what our fathers found our fathers." Their fathers did not know what their fathers did not know.
And those who disbelieve are like the example of the parable of those who call upon him as a shout, but they do not hear, but are deaf, dumb, dumb, blind, and blind.

It is only for you to die, and blood, and blood, and swine, and swine which Allah has ordained for them. There is no blame on him, nor is there any blame on him. But if there is no sin, there is no blame on him. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah has revealed to the Book that which is revealed to the people, and a small price for a paltry price; they shall not be consumed in the Fire, but Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
These are the ones who have purchased guidance from the way of error and forgiveness. So how will they be rewarded?
That is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth, and that the people of the Book will have a great punishment.
You will not be able to call on the East and the West to you. That is good, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and the angels, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the needy, and they are the truthful.
O ye who believe! Lo! ye are the believing ones for the sake of the believers, and that ye may slay him, and that he may leave his wife from the wife of his wife, and that he may leave his brother. That is that which is best for him from your Lord. That is a mercy from your Lord, and a mercy from your Lord. This is a mercy from your Lord. This is a mercy from your Lord.
And this is the life of your life, that you may be godfearing.
And when death approaches you from among you, if he leaves wealth, he will give parents near to parents and relatives. That is the duty of the pious.

The Qur'an is that Allah has revealed to you the Qur'an in the Qur'an, that the Qur'an is a guide for the people, and the guidance of the Qur'an is that the Qur'an has been revealed to you.

“Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight against you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah does not love the aggressors.”

Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian, but he was a man, and he was not a Muslim, and he was not of the idolaters.
The people of Abraham, who followed him, followed him, and believes in him. And Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
A group of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they do not guide themselves except themselves, and they do not understand.
O People of the Scripture, do you not believe in Allah's signs?
O people of the Scripture! Why do you clothe truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?
And some of the People of the Book say: "Believe in the Qur'an in the day of the believers, that they may believe in it, and reject the end of it, so that they may turn away."
And do not believe in those who follow your religion. Say: "The guidance of Allah has guided you." Say, "You believe not in faith, or that you may have a share from your Lord." Say, "It is in Allah's hand, and He gives whom He wills. And Allah is Ample, Knowing."
He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
And among the People of the Book there are some who are among you, if you give them a wealth of wealth, and among them there are some of them who will not leave it unless you leave him. That is because they say, "We do not have any share in it." That is because they say, "We are not responsible for those who are ignorant."
Nay, whoever fulfills his pledge and fears Allah, verily Allah loves those who fear Allah.
Those who sell Allah's covenant and their oaths for a small price, they will not have any portion in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
And among them are some among them in the Book, with their tongues, that you may understand that it is a Book of the Book, and they say: "This is not from Allah." They say: "This is from Allah." And they say: "This is not from Allah." And they say: "This is not from Allah."
It is not for any man that Allah has given him the Book and the prophethood, and he said to his people: "I am only one of those who worship Allah."
“And the angels and the messengers will not make you as lords in the name of your Lord, so will you reject your religion?”
And (remember) when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets: "I am given you a Messenger and Wisdom after you." Then you will believe in him with what is with you, and you will believe him. He said: "You shall believe in him and help him."
But whoever turns away after it is indeed the transgressors.
Do they seek to seek other than Allah's religion? And whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly, willingly, willingly, willingly, and to Him will be returned.
Say: "We believe in Allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and all of them. We make no distinction between any of them."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after they disbelieved after they disbelieved, and that the Messenger had come to them with clear proofs? And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
They are the ones who have incurred the punishment of Allah, the angels, the angels, and all mankind.
They will abide therein, and will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.
Except for those who repent and do good, surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
But those who disbelieved after their belief and then increase in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted for them, and they are the losers.
Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, they will not be able to be able to be accepted from the earth; they will not be accepted from it, for they will have a painful punishment.
By no means will you attain righteousness unless you love the love of Allah. Whatever you spend, Allah knows it well.
Every food was made lawful for the Children of Israel and the children of Israel had been forbidden by what was unlawful to them. Say: "Bring us the Torah, if you are truthful."
Then those who invent a lie against Allah will be the wrongdoers.
Say: "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists."
Indeed, the first House for mankind is that which was promised for mankind and a guidance for the people.
There are signs in the clear signs of Abraham. And whoever enters it with him, he is safe for him; and whoever walks in a place of security, Allah will provide for them a mosque for him. And whoever disbelieves not, Allah is Independent of all things.
Say: "O people of the Scripture! Why do you not believe in Allah's signs?
Say: "O people of the Scripture, why do you have faith in the way of Allah, seeking the way of those who believe in it? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
O you who believe! If you obey some of the People of the Book, they will then believe you after your belief.
And how can you disbelieve in the disbelievers, who are recited to you from Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW) is in you, and whoever turns on Allah, He will guide him to a straight path?
O you who believe, fear Allah, fear Allah, and do not die except as Muslims as Muslims.
And hold fast to the covenant of Allah, all together, and be not divided with them. And remember Allah's favour on you when you were enemies, and He made hearts in your hearts. And they were in the pit of the pit of the Fire, and they were driven out of the pit of the pit of God. Thus Allah made clear His revelations to you, so that you may be guided.
And among you there are some who invite good to good, and enjoin good and forbid evil. These are the successful.
And be not like those who are divided with them and become divided after them after clear proofs, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.
On the Day when some faces will become white, and some faces will be black, will it be said to them, "Did you reject faith after accepting faith?" Then you will be denied to the disbelievers.
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will have mercy in Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the signs of Allah which We recite to you with truth; and Allah does not desire the wrong-doers.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and to Allah will they return.
You are the best of the people who have created the people, so that you may enjoin what is right, and believe in Allah. If the People of the Scripture believe, it is better for them; most of them are transgressors.
They will not harm you with a trifling annoyance, and if they fight against you, they will have their backs, and they will not be helped.
There is a curse for those who have rejected Allah and the prophets, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and the prophets. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messengers. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messengers, and they are transgressors.
They are not like the like of the people of the Book; there are some of the People of the Book, who recite the night of Allah in the night of the night, in the night, and in prayer.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and they hasten in good deeds, and they are among the righteous.
And whatever good they do, they will not be denied by it; and Allah knows the godfearing.
Those who disbelieve, neither will their wealth nor their children avail them against Allah. They are the dwellers of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.
The likeness of this world is like the like of the life of the world, as the likeness of the people is like the people who have wronged themselves, and it destroys it; and Allah is not unjust to them.
O you who believe! Do not make friends of your friends other than others, but they will not harm you. They will not harm you. Their mouths has become manifest from their mouths; and what is hidden is greater than what their hearts conceal, and what is hidden is greater than you.
It is you who love them, and you do not love those who believe in Allah and the Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe," but when they meet you with their rage they say, "We believe in your rage." Say: "Do not kill yourselves."
If good befalls you, it grieves them, but if you do evil, they rejoice in it, and if you are patient and fear Allah, your guile will not avail you. Indeed Allah encompasses what they do.
And remember when your family came to you in the morning for the battle of the believers, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
When two groups of the two parties met between you, they sought to help them with Allah, and the believers put their trust in Allah.
And Allah had helped you at Badr when you were contemptible, so fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, “Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down with you?”
But if you are patient and fear, then they will come to you with your Lord with five thousand angels, and will help you with the angels.
And Allah has not given you the glad tidings but that your hearts may be fulfilled, so that your hearts may be secure, and Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
That He may cut off the unbelievers, or punish them, and they will not return to them.
It is not for you to be in the decision, or to punish them or punish them, for they are the wrongdoers.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whom He will and punishes whom He will. And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.
O ye who believe! Be not doubled, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that ye may prosper.
And fear the Fire from the Fire for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, that you may receive mercy.
And march forth from your Lord for forgiveness and a Garden whose width is the heavens and the earth, prepared for the pious.
Those who spend in prosperity and spend in adversity, and restrain anger and pardon men; and Allah loves those who do good.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives sins except Allah? And do not persist in what they have done.
The reward of their Lord is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. How excellent is the reward of the righteous.
Many nations have passed away before you, so travel through the earth and see how was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a Reminder for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for those who fear Allah.
And do not grieve, nor grieve, if you are believers, then you will be superior to the truth.
If a wound has touched you, a wound of those who have disbelieved against you, and that We may make some of them go forth, and that Allah may test those who believe, and that Allah may know those who believe, and Allah does not love the unjust.
And so that Allah may test those who believe and do not deny the disbelievers.
Do you think that you will enter Paradise in the Garden of Allah, and that Allah will not make those among you who are patient?
And indeed, you did not wish for death before you met it. Then you have seen it, and you will see it.
And Muhammad is not a Messenger, but there is a Messenger before him, or if he dies or will you turn back on your heels, then will you turn back on your heels? And whoever turns back on his heels, Allah will not harm him, and Allah will reward the grateful.
And death is not for him except by Allah's leave; and whoever desires the life of this world, We shall give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We shall give him thereof; and We shall reward him with the good reward.
And many of the prophets have fought many of them, and they did not have a covenant against Allah's way, and they did not weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, and Allah loves those who are patient.
And their saying, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and our excesses in our affair, and make us firm our feet, and help us against the unbelieving people."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the hereafter, and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you to your heels, and you will be losers.
Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
"We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, that they should not associate with Allah partners with which He has sent down no authority; and their abode is the Fire, and it is the end of the unjust."
And indeed Allah promised you the promise of your promise, so that they might be killed with you. But you were in doubt concerning it, and you did not differ about that which you had been given to you. But you were among your own people. And you were not among yourselves; but He turned away from you, so that He might test you from the desire of the world; and He will test you from your sins. And Allah is the Owner of the believers.
And when you were fleeing, then you did not see any one of them, and the Messenger called you to account for you, so that you might have a recompense for the evil of you, so that you may not grieve for what you did not have escaped from what has escaped you, nor grieve what you did not grieve.
Then He sent down upon you an angel, and sent down from among you a party of among you, and some of them said: "Do not be afraid of those who have wronged themselves." But they said, "What is the reward of our Lord?" They said, "This is what is best for us." They said, "This is what is best for us." They said, "This is what is best for us." They said, "This is what is best for us." Say: "It is not for us that Allah is with us."
Those on you who turned on the Day of Resurrection, when they saw the two armies, Satan threw them out of the land. But Allah forgave them for their sins; surely Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when they were travelling with their brothers in the land, or fighting in the land, and they said: "If we had been with us, they would not have died in it, nor would they have been slain; so Allah will test them in their hearts, and Allah will cause death to die."
And if you are killed or die in the cause of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are better than all that they amass.
And if you die or die, then you will be gathered to Allah.
And Allah's mercy is upon them. And you were gentle to them; and if you were harsh and hard, they would certainly have dispersed from around you; so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them. So ask forgiveness for them and ask forgiveness for them. Then when you have decided, put your trust in Allah, surely Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, then He will help you. So let the believers put their trust in Allah.
And there is no prophet but a Messenger; and whoever does evil, he will have a burden on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul will be recompensed for what he earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah who gives him the pleasure of Allah's wrath? Their abode is Hell, and evil is the destination.
They are grades of Allah, and Allah sees what they do.
Allah conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Signs, and instructing them in the Book, and instructing them in the Book, and that they were in manifest error.
And when it was inflicted on you, you would have touched him twice, and you would say, "This is what is from it." Say: "This is from your own hands." Say: "This is from your own hands." Say: "This is from your own accord."
“And what was promised for you on the day when the two armies met the two armies, by Allah's permission, that He might know the believers.
And those who hypocrites know that they said: Come to the cause of Allah, or fight in the way of Allah. They said: "If we had stayed with us, we would surely have been with you." They said: "We were with you." They say: "We are with you." They say, "We are with you." They say, "God knows what is in their hearts, and Allah knows what they conceal."
They are the ones who said to their brothers, "If they had not believed with us, they would not have been slain." Say, "If you are truthful, then you would have died from death."
And reckon not those who are killed in the cause of Allah as dead. Nay, they are alive with their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed on them, and those who follow those who are behind them will not be rewarded with them, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in Allah and His bounty, and Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
But those who responded to Allah and His messenger after the wound of Allah and the Messenger, and for them is a great reward.
Those who said to the people, "The people have gathered against you, so fear them." But it increased their faith, and they said, "Allah is enough for us."
So they returned out with Allah's grace and grace, no harm touched them, and they followed the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
It is only Satan who suggests to you the fear of his friends, so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And let not those grieve thee who rush into disbelief until they do not harm Allah. Allah desires not to do anything in the Hereafter, but that He will not give them any portion in the Hereafter, and theirs will be a great chastisement.
Those who believe in the cause of Allah will not harm aught, but they will have a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for them. We grant them respite for their sins; and they will have a disgraceful punishment.
It is not for Allah that you should believe in the believers, so that you may perish from the evil of the evil, and Allah will not know what He will of the unseen. But Allah chooses whom He will of His messengers. Believe in Allah and His messengers. But believe in Allah and His Messengers, and you will have a great reward.
And those who do not think of what Allah has bestowed on them, do not think that it is good for them; it is better for them that they will be taken on the Day of Resurrection. They will be on the Day of Resurrection on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Allah heard the saying of those who said: "We are Allah's, and we are rich, and we say: 'We did not write the prophets and the prophets unjustly, and they will say, 'Taste the punishment of the Fire!'
This is because of what your hands have sent before you, and Allah is not unjust to His servants.
They say: "Allah has promised us that we should not believe in any Messenger until he cast us out of the Fire." Say: "Messengers of Messengers came to you before us." Say: "Messengers came to me before me, and you did not kill them."
But if they deny you, then Messengers were denied before you, and the Scripture and the Book, and the Scripture, and the Scripture, and the Scripture, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the Book, and the

You will surely be in your wealth and your souls, and you will surely be able to listen to those who have been given the Book before you and from among those who have been given the Book. But if you are patient and fear Allah, He is the One who is the best of all things.
And (remember) when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Scripture: "It is written to you to preach to mankind, and you do not perceive it, but they threw it behind behind their backs."
Do not be like those who rejoice in what they have earned, and love those who do not love what they do not do. They will not be punished for the punishment, and they will have a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Able to do all things.
The creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, are signs for those who are wise.
Those who remember Allah, standing and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], "Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; Glory be to You, so protect us from the punishment of the Fire."
Our Lord! Thou wilt admit me to the Fire, and the wrong-doers will have no helper.
Our Lord! We have heard the call of a caller calling to the believers, "Believe in your Lord,” and we said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us from our evil deeds."
Our Lord! Grant us what Thou hast promised us by Thy apostles, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection; for Thou art not a tyrant.
Then their Lord called to them, "I am not a slave of you, or the women of you." They will not do so, except for some of you; and they will be in the midst of their homes, and they will find their homes, and they will be driven out of their homes, and they will have their own souls, and they will have their own souls, and they will have their own souls, and they will have no reward from Allah.
"Do not let the unbelievers go into the land of the unbelievers.
This is a good enjoyment; then their abode is Hell, and evil is the destination.
But those who fear their Lord, for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide therein forever. For Allah is the best of the righteous.
Among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and what has been sent down to you, and in what has been sent down to them, they have not believed in Allah's communications for a small price. These are the ones who have received their reward with their Lord. These are the reward of their Lord. Lo! Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! Be patient and patient and remain steadfast and fear Allah so that you may prosper.

These are the limits of Allah; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow; and that is the great triumph.

God is All-Knowing, All-wise.
And (as for) those who have not believing women, nor women, nor women, male among themselves, are among those who are near to you; and Allah knows best what is in your faith, so that you may be one of another; and that which is incumbent on them is better than Allah, and that they should give them a portion of their own souls, and that they may be modest, and that they may be modest; and Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

Verily, those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), if they had all that is in the earth, and if it had come to them from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and they will not be accepted it, and they will have a painful punishment.
They will wish to come out of the Fire, but they will not be able to get it; and they will have a lasting punishment.
The male and female women, male women, male or female; for Allah is Mighty, Wise.
But whoever repents after his crime and does good, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Do you not know that Allah is the One Who is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He will and forgives whom He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.
O Prophet! Do not let your grieve grieve you. They are disbelievers who say to their mouths: "We believe,” they say, "We believe not in faith, and their hearts have not come to you." They will not come to you, and they will not come to you, but they will not come to you, but they will not come to you, but they will say to the Jews, "If you are good, you will not have been saved from Allah." They will say, "This is what you are commanded."
Those who listen to the truth are lying in the way of falsehood, but if they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. But if they turn away from them, judge between them, and judge between them judge between them. Lo! Allah loves those who do good.
And how can they give you permission until they come to you? The Torah is in Allah's way, then they turn away from it. But they are not believers.
We have sent down the Torah in the Torah, and in the light, and the light, and the prophets, and the Jews, and the Jews, and the Jews, that they were given the Book of God; so fear them not; but fear Me, and fear Me; so fear Me not, and fear Me not.
And We ordained for them in the past, a nose for a man, an eye, a nose, an ear for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for a tooth. Whoever does not judge by what Allah has sent down, they are the wrongdoers.
And We sent in their footsteps Jesus son of Mary, confirming that which was before him of the Torah, and We gave him the Gospel, wherein was guidance and light, confirming that which was before it, and that which was before it, and a guidance for those who fear Allah.
And let the People of the Book judge that which Allah has sent down to judge, and those who do not judge in what Allah has sent down, they are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, confirming the Book that is before them, and that which has been sent down to them, so that you may judge between them with what has been revealed to you. And follow not their desires from what has come to you from the truth, and follow not their desires from the truth. And let them not follow your desires, and let them follow you. And if Allah wills, He will have made you one of all that you have given you. Then you will be returned to Allah.
And judge between them with what Allah has revealed to them, and follow not their desires; and fear them with fear from which Allah has sent down to you. But if they turn away, know that Allah will punish them for their sins. But most of mankind are transgressors.
Is it better than the people who wish to be better than God?
O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, surely surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And you will see those in whose hearts is a disease, and they say, "We fear lest a misfortune should befall us." Then Allah will send them a fear from Allah, or send a command from Him, so that their hearts may be forgiven.
And those who believe will say, "Are these the ones who swore by Allah that they would not be with you?"
O you who believe! whoever among you turns away from his religion, then Allah will love him, and will love him with a love of the believers, and they will not strive in the cause of Allah against those who strive against the unbelievers, strive to fight in the cause of Allah. That is the bounty of Allah, whom He wills; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
“Your friends are only Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, and those who establish the prayer and pay alms, while they are (all) submissive.”
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and the believing believers, then surely he is the party of Allah.
O you who believe! Do not take those who have been given the Book before you and those who were before you, and do not take the disbelievers as a mockery for those who have believed. So fear Allah, if you are believers.
And when you call to prayer, they take it as mockery and sport; this is because they are a people who do not understand.
Say: "O people of the Scripture! do you find no fault for us except that we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and that which has been revealed to us, and that most of you are transgressors?"
Say: "Shall I inform you of a worse punishment from Allah? Those who incurred wrath from Allah and those who were cursed by apes and swine and swine, those who worshipped Satan, they are worse and worse, and they are far astray from the path of evil."
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe in it, but they are in the midst of those who disbelieve; and Allah knows best what they conceal."
And you see many of them see the sin of sin, and the devouring of what is forbidden, and that which they have done is evil.
And why do they not forbid the rabbis and the things of their own hands, and from what they have forbidden? Evil is what they used to do.
And the Jews said: "Allah's plan is with the poor." They said, "They are not with those who have been proud of their hands." But they are not in the hands of their own hands, but it is only that they are in the hands of your Lord, and that it may be for them from your Lord. That is what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and in the end of the Day of Resurrection, they will have a share of what has been revealed to them. And Allah will not make mischief in the land, and Allah does not love the arrogant.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would have removed their sins and admitted them to gardens of bliss.
And if they had been sent down to the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them from their Lord, they would have taken out of them out of their hands and from their feet; but most of them are most disobedient.
O Messenger! deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord. Do not follow it. But if you do not do it not, Allah will protect you from the people; and Allah will protect you from the people; surely Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.
Say: "O people of the Scripture, you have no right to stand on you until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord."
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
We took the Children of Israel with the Children of Israel, and We sent messengers to them with their own souls, so that no one of them did not desire their hearts, and they rejected some of them, and they slew others.
And they thought that it was not a trial, so they became blind and deaf, so Allah turned back towards them. But most of them became blind and deaf; and Allah sees what they do.
Surely they say, "The Messiah, son of Mary, is Allah's son." And the Messiah said, "O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. That is what Allah has forbidden for those who associate partners with Allah, and his abode will be the Fire; and the wrongdoers will be helpers.
Those who say: "These are the helpers of Allah." There is no god but Allah. There is no god save Him. But if they do not desist, then woe to those who disbelieve.
Why do they not turn back to Allah and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger. Messengers passed away from him, and his mother said to his mother, "Indeed, we eat food with food. Look at them, see how We make clear to them. See how they are deluded."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which is no harm or benefit for you? Allah is All-hearing, All-knowing."
Say: "O people of the Scripture, do not exceed your religion in the religion of the truth, do not follow the desires of the people, and do not follow the desires of the people who have gone astray before them."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and persisted.
They did not forbid one another from what they used to do, and what they used to do.
You see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which their souls have sent forward before them. They will have a curse against Allah, and they will have a lasting punishment.
And if they had believed in Allah and His Messenger and what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them as friends, but most of them are transgressors.
The Jews will find a fault in the sight of the believers, and the believing men. You will see those who say, "We are Christians." That is because they say, "We are Christians and monks." That is because of them are many of them, and they are not proud.
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears. They say, "Our Lord, we have believed, so write us down among the witnesses."
And what is it that we do not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us, so that our Lord will admit us with the righteous people?
Then Allah will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide therein forever. That is the reward of the righteous.
But those who disbelieved and deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are the dwellers of the Fire.
O you who believe! Do not make lawful for the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not commit aggression; surely Allah does not love the transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has provided for you and eat for you, and fear Allah in Whom you believe.
Allah will not make you swear to your oaths, but you will not swear to Him in order that you may give you a burden, so that you may maintain the hearts of the people, and that you may be poor, and that you may eat for the poor, or that you may eat for the poor, or that you may not be able to do anything, or that you may not be able to take it. That is that which you have sworn, so that you may be grateful.
O you who believe! intoxicants and gambling, and divining arrows and divining arrows are only Satan's handiwork; so fear them so that you may prosper.
Satan wants to eat you with intoxicants and hatred, and that you may not be able to make enmity between you and from the remembrance of Allah. Will you not then desist?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger; and fear Him, if you turn back, then know that the Messenger is only to convey the message.
There is no blame for those who believe and do good deeds for what they have earned, and believe and believe, and do righteous deeds, and fear Allah and believe and do good, and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! Allah has promised you to be a slave of that which is in your hands, or that it may be that you may know that Allah knows what is in the hearts, and that He may test those who fear Him.
O you who believe! Do not exult in the land, and you will not be able to kill you; and whoever dies, then you shall have a double of the two of you. Let him not be a slave for you, or let the poor eat for you, or let the poor eat for you, or let the poor, or let the poor eat, or let it be for the poor; for Allah is Strong, Mighty.
It is for the sea for you to eat for the sea, and it is for you to eat for it and for you for the pilgrimage, and in the land you have been forbidden. And fear Allah, and fear Allah, to Him you will be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah in the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, and the people, and the people, and the people, and the people, so that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message, and Allah knows what you conceal and what you conceal.
Say: "The hypocrites are not the good and the needy, even though the evil ones may benefit you. So fear Allah, so that you may be successful."
O you who believe! Do not ask about any of them who are truthful to you, if you should be able to ask you about the Qur'an, then if you ask about the Qur'an, it is clear to you, and Allah will forgive you. Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
A people before you asked about you, and they disbelieved in it.
Allah has not ordained for you a dream, or a <unk>, or a <unk>, or a polytheist, and the disbelievers, they deny Allah; but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger," they say: "Sufficient for us is that which we found our fathers our fathers, and if their fathers knew not, they are not guided."
O you who believe! Be sure for your own souls. If you are guided, you will not find any harm from your own soul. To Allah you will be returned to all that you did, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who believe! When death approaches you, they are two believers, so that they may be better than you. But if you are in the land, then you are only in the land; then if you are in the land, then then you shall be brought back to the earth, then if you doubt them, then then you shall be called back to the two months, and if you have no doubt, then then they will have a share of Allah.
But if it should be that they should be guilty of the sin of the two men, they shall have two of their wives, except by their wives, and they will swear by Allah: "Our testimony is truer than the testimony of our testimony." And they said: "Our testimony is truer than the truth, and we have not transgressed."
It is nearer to them that they may bear witness to the truth, or that they may be afraid of their oaths; and fear Allah, and fear Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust people.
On the Day when Allah will gather all His Messengers, He will say: "What is your response?" They said: "We have no knowledge of this."
And when Jesus, son of Mary, said, "My Lord, I have vowed to you the favor of my mother, and that I may love you with those whom I have bestowed on you, and the people who are in the Book will have no power in the sight of the people, and they will have the Book and the Gospel, and they will have the Book of God, and they will not be able to follow it, and when they were given it, it will be said to them, "This is nothing but obvious magic." And when they came to you, they said, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And when I inspired the disciples, "Believe in Me and My Messenger,” they said, "We believe, bear witness that we are Muslims."
And when the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, will your Lord send down to us a table from heaven?"
They said: "We wish to eat from it and our hearts, and we know that the truth has come to us, and that you may bear witness of the truth."
Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table table from heaven, so that it may be for us the first of us and the last of us. You are a sign for us and a sign from Thee. You are the best of providers."
Allah said: "I am sent down to you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam), then I send down to you (Muhammad SAW) after that, and if I disobey you, I will punish him with a severe torment."
And when Allah will say, "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother besides Allah?' He will say, ‘Glory be to you, my Lord, I am not truthful.’
I said not to them aught except what Thou didst command me: "Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." But when I dwelt among them, Thou wast a watcher over them; while Thou didst take me up, Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art the Knower of all things.
If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Allah will say: "This is a Day of truth that will benefit their truthfulness with truth; theirs will be gardens beneath which rivers flow; they will abide therein forever. Allah is pleased with them. That is the great triumph.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and He has power over all things.
All praise belongs to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the light, and the light, so that the disbelievers are equal to the Lord.
He it is Who created you from clay, then decreed a term for him, and a term appointed for him; then you will not doubt.
And Allah is the One Who is in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you have hidden and what you do.
There is no sign of the signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it.
But they denied the truth when it came to them, but they will come to them with a painful punishment.
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them, and We have established on the earth a great authority in which We have not established you, and We caused the sky to flow beneath them, and rivers flow beneath them, and We caused them to grow in the midst of their sins, and We destroyed them among them.
And if We had sent down to you a Book from paper, they would have touched their hands, and they would have said, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not been sent down to him from the angels?" And if We had sent down an angel, it would have been decreed for them, but they would not be reprieved.
And if We had made him an angel, We would have made him a human being, and We would have made them in the matter that they would have been confused.
And indeed Messengers were mocked before you, but they mocked at them that they mocked with them.
Say: "Travel in the land and see how was the end of the rejecters."
Say: "To whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "He is the One Who gives mercy on whom He will. He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection concerning the Day of Resurrection. He will not gather you with the Day of Resurrection."
To Him belongs all that is in the night and the day, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Say: "Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, besides whom He will not give provision?" Say: "I am commanded to be the first of those who submit to Him." Say: "I am commanded to be the first of those who believe."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I fear not if my Lord should punish me on the Day of Resurrection."
On the Day when it will be averted from him, Allah will have mercy on him; and this is a great triumph.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, none can remove it except Him; and if He touches you with good, He has power over all things.
He is the Omnipotent, the Wise.
Say: "What is the matter with you?" Say: "I bear witness that Allah is witness of you and that which is revealed to you." And the Qur'an has been revealed to me, and that you may warn those who are warned from the truth. Do you not think that Allah will give you a witness?
Those whom We have given the Book know that they recognize their sons; they will not believe in their own souls.
Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not be successful.
And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, "Where are your associates?"
But they will not be able to say to them, “By Allah, our Lord, we have no partners.”
See how they used to lie against them, and then they turned away from them.
And among them are some who listen to thee, and We have hearts whose hearts have ears to understand them, and deafness not in their ears; but if they see every sign, they will not believe in them; they will not believe until they come with thee. The unbelievers say: "These are nothing but tales of the ancients."
And they prohibit (others) from it, and they turn away from them, and they do not destroy themselves except themselves, and they do not know.
And if you could see when they will be in the Fire, they will say, "Oh, would that we would be brought back, and we would not deny the signs of our Lord, and we would not have been believers."
Nay, it was to come to them before that which they used to hide, and if they were to return to it, they would have been cast away from what they have been forbidden; surely they are indeed liars.
And they say: "There is nothing but the life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected."
And if you could see, when they are before their Lord, He will say, "Is this not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say, "Taste the punishment of your Lord."
They are those who deny the meeting of Allah. When the Hour comes to them, they will say: "Woe to us!" They will say, "Woe to us! Alas for us for what they used to do." They will bear their burdens on their burdens.
And the life of this world is nothing but amusement and amusement; and the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Will you not then understand?
Verily, We know that they will not grieve you with what they say, but they say, "You are not a liar."
And indeed Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient and patient until Our help came to them. And none can alter the words of Allah; and there is none who can alter the words of Allah.
And if their aversion should be hard for you, then if you find a tunnel on the earth or a ladder of heaven, or bring a sign to them, let them bring them a sign; and if Allah willed, He will have guided them all, so do not be of the ignorant.
Those who listen to the call will be called to Allah on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah will gather them on the Day of Resurrection.
And they say: "Why has not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Allah has sent down a sign, but most of them know not."
And there is no creature in the earth, nor a bird, nor can they look at its wings, but they are like the people of the Book. We do not follow anything but the Book of their Lord.
And those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) are deaf and dumb, but Allah leaves whom He will astray, and He guides whom He wills to the straight path.
Say: "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or the Hour, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but they call upon Him, so that you may call upon Him, and that you will be called to Him, and you will not forget what you associate with Him.
And indeed We sent Messengers before you, and We seized them with distress and hardship so that they might humble themselves.
So when Our punishment came to them suddenly, they did not think that their hearts were hardened, and their hearts were hardened, and Satan made them attractive to them.
So when they forgot what they were reminded of, We opened them all of the gates of all that they had given them, and We seized them with what they used to do.
And the people of the evildoers were cut off, and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say: "Have you considered, if Allah should take away your hearing and your sight, and set up your hearts, that He will bring you back from the other, but that He may bring you back?"
Say: "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you suddenly or openly, will they not destroy the people of the wrong-doers?"
And We have sent the Messenger and the givers of glad tidings to those who have faith, and those who believe, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
And for those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will have a painful punishment for them.
Say: "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know that I am the Knower of the Unseen, and I do not follow anything but that which has been revealed to me." Say: "Are the blind and the blind?" Say, "Are the blind and the like of the blind?"
And fear those who fear their Lord with fear of their Lord, and they will not have any protector besides Allah, and that they may be godfearing.
And do not turn away from those who call upon their Lord in the morning and evening, seeking His pleasure, for they have no portion of what they have earned, nor do you have any share for them. You will turn away from them, and you will be among the wrongdoers.
And thus We made some of them so that they might say: "Are these the people whom Allah has bestowed with us?" Allah does not know the grateful people.
And when those who believe in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) come to you, say: "Peace be upon you," so that your Lord has mercy upon you, so that you may do evil in ignorance, and then repent and act righteously, then He is Forgiving, Merciful.
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), so that they may be guided.
Say: "I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah. Say: I am not responsible for your desires; I am not going to follow your desires, and I am not of the guided."
Say: "I am indeed a clear proof from your Lord, and you deny it, for I am not responsible for what you desire to hasten." It is only Allah who gives the truth to the truth, and He is the best of deciders.
Say: "If you were to hasten for me, I would have been brought to you in the matter, and Allah knows best the wrongdoers."
To Him belongs the keys of the unseen. He knows what is in the earth, and He knows what is in the sea, and it is not a leaf, nor a leaf, nor a leaf, nor a leaf, nor the earth, nor the earth, nor any tree.
He it is Who takes your souls by night, and He knows what you have done by day; then He raises you up again that a specified term may be fulfilled; then to Him is your return; then He will inform you of what you did.
He is the One Who takes His servants over His servants, and He sends you up from the dead, when death approaches them, and they will not die, and they will not be able to do anything.
Then they will be returned to their Lord, to Him belongs the truth; and He is the swiftest of the reckoning.
Say: "Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him in humility and in secret?" Say: "If we give us thanks from Allah, we shall surely be of the thankful."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah will protect you from your distress and from every distress, then you will be set up (with Him)."
Say: "He will have power upon you from above you, or from your feet, or from your feet, or some of you will make some of you make some of you, and We will make some of you taste some of them, so see how We explain the communications."
And your people deny it, and it is the truth. Say: "I am not responsible for you."
Every time will come to you, and you will know.
And when you see those who dispute in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), turn away from them, turn away from them. But if Satan touches you, then do not follow the people of the unjust.
“And those who fear Allah will not be accountable for them, but they may be reminded of them so that they may fear Allah.”
And (as for) those who take a religion for their religion and play themselves, and let them present the life of this world, and warn them with the Qur'an, so that they may not be able to leave their own souls. They will have no protector besides Allah. They will have no protector besides Allah, and they will have no protector. They will have no protector. They will have no protector. They will have a painful punishment.
Say: "Shall we call upon Allah that which does not benefit us nor harm him, and then turn away from him from whom Allah has guided us?
And establish prayer, and fear Him, and be careful of Him to Whom you will be gathered.
And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He will say to the Day of Resurrection: "Be!" and it will be that the Day of Judgment will be fulfilled; and the trumpet will be blown on the Day of Resurrection. He is the All-Wise, the All-wise.
And when Ibrahim said to his father, Azar, "Do you take idols as gods?" And I will see you, "You are indeed a plain people."
And thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who have certitude.
When the night saw him, he saw a star, he said, "This is my Lord." But when they set up, he said, "I do not love anything."
When he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord!" But when he said, "If my Lord does not guide me, I will surely be among the people who have gone astray."
When he saw the sun rising in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord!" But when he said, "My people, I am like the people who associate with you, and I am innocent of what you associate with me."
Indeed, I have turned away from Him who is the One who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the polytheists.
And his people argued with him. He said, "Do you argue with me about Allah? I have guided me to the right path, so I fear that I should not fear what you associate with me. My Lord encompasses all things in knowledge."
And fear I fear that I should fear what you associate with Allah, while you fear not that Allah has sent down to you no authority from which He has not sent down to you any authority? But if you know that the two parties is better than one another.
Those who believe and do not believe in their belief, for them is a safe path, and they are guided.
And indeed, our argument is to be fulfilled for Abraham from his people. We will raise him in degrees whom We will. Your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.
And We gave Abraham Isaac and Jacob, and We guided him with the guidance of Noah and his descendants, and Solomon, and Joseph, and Aaron, and Moses, and Aaron, and Moses, and Aaron, and thus We reward the virtuous.
And Zechariah and John, and Elias, and Elias, and each of them were righteous.
And Ismail, and Elisha, and Lot, and Lot, and all of them We preferred above the nations.
And among their fathers, and their brothers, and their brothers, and We guided them and guided them to the right path.
Allah guides whom He will of His servants, and He guides whom He will.
These are the ones whom We gave to the Book and wisdom and prophethood; so if they do not believe in it, We have already made a people who disbelieve not in it.
These are the ones whom Allah has guided, so follow them. Say: "I ask of you no reward for this. This is a Reminder for all mankind."
And they did not believe with Allah, because they said, "Why has not been sent down to us from Allah?" Say: "He has sent down the Book from the Book to the people who did not believe." Say: "The Book has been sent down to you from the people, and that you may make it clear to you." Say, "Allah has given you the Book, and that you may hide them." Say, "Allah has revealed the Book." Say, "Allah has revealed the Book."
And this is a Book which We have blessed before you, confirming that which is before it, and that you may warn the Mother of Cities and the people who believe in the Hereafter believe in it. And those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are their prayers.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or says, "What has been revealed to me?" And he said, "I have been sent down to the Book." Say, "I have sent down the Book which Allah has sent down to you. If you see it, then the angels will be judged by the angels." And if you see it, then the angels will be rewarded with their own souls, and you will not be able to kill them.
And indeed, you shall come to Us, except that We created you first, and We have left you behind your backs, and We have not seen you with those who have not seen you. We do not see you with those whom you used to associate with Allah. Indeed, you are among the witnesses, and you are the witnesses of your idols.
It is Allah Who splits the grain of grain and the grain of grain, the living and the dead, the living of the living. That is Allah, the One, how are you turned away; how are you deluded?
It is the dawn, the day, the rest, and the night, and the sun, and the moon; for He is the Mighty, the Wise.
And He it is Who has made the stars subservient to you, that you may help the children of the sea and the sea in the depths of the sea. Verily, We have made clear to people the signs of the people.
And He it is Who has created you from a single soul, then it is a resting place and its resting-place. We have made clear to you a sign for a people who have understanding.
And He it is Who sends down water from the sky, then We bring forth fruits from every kind of grain, which We have brought forth from it; and from the date of the trees there are clusters, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, when they are a people who believe.
And those who associate partners with Allah set up partners in the sight of those who have taken themselves, and they are sons of what they have taught; Glory be to Him, above what they attribute, and He is exalted above what they do.
Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He is a son, and He has created all things. He has created all things, and He has knowledge of all things.
That is Allah, your Lord, there is no god but He, the Creator of all things; so worship Him. He is the Guardian of all things.
He comprehends not the vision, but He comprehends the eyes; and He is the Subtle, the Wise.
Indeed, there has come to you from your Lord with clear proofs; so whoever sees it will be for his own soul, and whosoever blinds himself will be his own loss, and I am not a keeper over you.
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), that they may say: "You have studied (the Qur'an), and that We may make it a sign for people who know."
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord; there is no god save Him, and turn away from the polytheists.
And if Allah had pleased, they would not have taken partners with Him; and We have not made you a keeper over them, and you are not of them.
Do not revile those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they revile Allah with knowledge, and that every word may be made fair for them; so that they may have their own deeds; then their Lord will return to them, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swear by Allah by their strongest oaths that if a sign had come to them, they would believe in it. Say: "These are the signs of Allah." Say: "These are the signs of Allah that you may not believe."
And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes, and their eyes will not be accepted before them, and We will leave them in their rebellion in their rebellion.
And if We had sent down to them angels, and the dead speak to them, and We would have gathered all things with their eyes, they would not believe in it, but most of them would not believe.
And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from among men and jinn, and some of the devils deceive each other. But if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so they would not have done it, and they will mislead them.
And so that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with it, and that they may have their deeds.
Say: "Shall I seek other than Allah other than Allah, when He has sent down to you the Book (the Qur'an) which has been sent down to you from the Book? Those who have been given the Book know that it has been revealed to you from your Lord.
And the word of your Lord is true in truth and in justice; none can change His words; and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from the path of Allah. They follow only conjecture and follow it.
Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
If you believe in Allah, then you will be in your faith.
And what is the matter for you that you do not eat from the name of Allah that which has been mentioned to you in the name of Allah? It is not lawful for you that you may have knowledge. But most of them follow their own desires. Surely, your Lord knows best the transgressors.
And turn away from the sin and the sin; for those who commit sins will be recompensed for what they used to earn.
And eat not that which is not mentioned in the name of Allah, for that is wrong, and that the evil of the devils may make their friends manifest; and if they obey them, they will argue with them, and if ye obey them, ye shall surely be sharers.
Is it not that We gave him life, and We made him a light of a light, whose people are like the like of the people who are in the hearts of the people? But it is not for those who disbelieved, because of what they did.
And in every city, We have made in every city a guilty criminals, so that they may conspire in it, and they do not deceive themselves except themselves, and they do not know.
And when a sign comes to them, they say: "We will not believe in it until they have been given the Messengers of Allah." Allah knows best what He has sent down to His Messenger. Those who commit evil will have a painful punishment from Allah. They will have a painful punishment.
And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He expands his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills, He makes his breast narrow and constricted, as if he were climbing down into heaven, then Allah will punish those who believe.
And this is a straight path from your Lord. We have indeed explained Our signs for a people who believe.
They will have their abode with their Lord, and He will reward them with what they used to do.
And on the Day when He will gather them all together, and He will say: "O mankind! Lo! the people of the jinn are among you." They will say: "Our Lord! We have made some of us excel others with others." They will say: "Your Lord! Lo! your abode is for us, and that ye may abide in the Fire." He will say: "Enter your home."
And thus do We make the wrong-doers among those who do wrong for what they used to earn.
O mankind, have not messengers come to you from among the people of men and men, who have come to you with My signs and warning you from the meeting of this Day of yours? They will say, "We bear witness against them, and bear witness to them." They will say, "We bear witness against them."
That is because your Lord will not destroy the towns unjustly, but they are unaware of their people.
Each of them are degrees of what they do, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
And your Lord is Rich, Most Merciful, and if He wills, He will destroy you from your sins, and appoint for you whom He will of the nations among you.
Verily, it is that which you have promised, and you will not escape.
Say: "O my people! I am acting to your own souls, and I am acting to you, and you will surely know that the righteous will be in the Hereafter; surely the wrongdoers will not prosper."
And they assign to Allah a portion of the tilth and cattle that He has created for them, and they say: "This is for Allah." They said: "This is for Allah." So they will not reach their partners with Allah. And whatever they associate with their associates, they will not reach their own souls. What is what they used to do.
And as for those who associate their partners in the religion of Allah, they would have made their children attractive to them, and their religion increased them in their religion. Had Allah willed, they would not have done it, and they will have nothing to fabricate.
And they say, "These are the cattle, and the tilth, and the tilth, except that they may not eat anything except for them." They say, "It is forbidden for the cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, for Allah's name, they will not be able to give them a lie."
And they say: "Whatever is in the bellies of the cattle is that which is in the bellies of the cattle, and for our wives." But if they die, they will have their own souls; and if they are dead, they will have their reward; surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-knowing.
Those who have lost their children without knowledge without knowledge, and what Allah has provided for them, they fabricate against Allah a lie against Allah. Surely, they have gone astray, and they are not guided.
And it is He who has produced the gardens and the gardens, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the fruit thereof, and its fruits, and the harvest thereof, and the harvest thereof; and not do not commit excess.
And the cattle and the cattle are made for you, and eat of what Allah has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is to you a clear enemy.
(27) (87) And from the tribe of sheep, and of the goats, and of women, and of women, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females?
And of the pair of the camels and of the two of them, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or when Allah has enjoined you? What is the matter of Allah? He is more unjust than those who lie against him. And most surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Say: "I do not spend in what has been revealed to me that I should eat for the forbidden of what has been revealed to them, or blood, or blood, or blood, or eat of it, for that which is in the name of the name of Allah, is no more than the name of the name of Allah, and in sin; for your Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful."
And We have forbidden the Jews, all of the trees, and the sheep, and the sheep, and the cattle, or the cattle, or their mothers, or their mothers, or their mothers, or their mothers, and We punished them with their deeds; and indeed we shall be truthful.
But if they deny you, say: "Your Lord is the Lord of all the people, and His punishment will not be averted from His people."
They will say: "Had Allah willed, we would not have worshipped us, nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden us." But those before them said, "We have denied those before them." Say: "This is nothing but your proof." Say: "Bring us your proof." Say: "This is nothing but a clear proof."
Say: "Allah is the One, if He willed, He would have guided you all.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Say to those who bear witness to their fathers, if they bear witness to them, do not bear witness with them, and those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) do not speak to them, and those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) do not speak to them.
Say: "I have forbidden you to follow your Lord, so that you may not associate anything with Him, and do not kill your parents, and do not kill your children. Do not kill your children, and do not kill your children. Do not kill your children, and do not kill them. That is what God has given you. That is what you do."
And do not approach the property of the property of the orphan, except that when its soul is fulfilled, and give full measure and weight in full measure. We do not burden any human soul beyond its capacity. And when you speak justice, it is better for you. And when you speak justice, it is just that you may be admonished.
And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow the paths of others; they will not leave you from His way. Thus He commands you that you may be godfearing.
Then We gave Moses the Book, completing the favour of Allah, and explaining everything, and a guidance and a mercy, that they may believe in their Lord.
And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it, and fear that you may receive mercy.
Lest you not say: "The Book has been sent down before us from the two sects, and we were unaware of it."
Or lest they should say, "If the Book had been sent down to us, they would have been better guided than them." Then there is a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance from your Lord. And who is more unjust than he who rejects the communications of Allah and turns away from them? We will punish those who turn away from Our signs. We shall have a painful punishment.
Do they not wait for that which is sent down to them from the angels or from your Lord, or from your Lord's signs? On the Day of Resurrection, there will be no more than a sign for the people of your Lord. On the Day of Resurrection, the people will not believe in it. Say: "Wait for us." Say: "Wait!"
“Those who have divided their religion and sects, you have no authority in them; but their affair is with Allah; then He will inform them of what they used to do.”
Whoever brings a good deed will be tenfold like a little like it, and whoever does evil will be recompensed for it, and they will not be wronged.
Say: “My Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Abraham.
Say: "Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my life, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
I am not associate with Him, and I am the first of those who believe and I am the first of those who submit.
Say: "Shall I seek other than Allah as a Lord? He is the Lord of all things, and every soul shall not bear any burden except by any soul; and then shall there be no burden with any soul with another. Then shall ye be brought back to your Lord."
And He it is Who has made you inheritors of the earth, and He has made some of you excel others above others, that He may test you in that which He has given you; surely your Lord is swift in retribution; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
Alif Lam Mim.
The Book has sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) that you may warn them (O Muhammad SAW), so that you may warn (them) with it in your heart, and that you may be admonished.
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow the guardians of those who do not follow the other. Little are little.
And how many a township have We destroyed; then Our punishment came to them, or they were sleeping at night.
And when Our punishment came to them, they said: "We are not the wrongdoers."
Then We will question those who have been sent to Our Messengers, and We will question the messengers.
Then We will inform them of what We have taught them, and we are not of it.
And on the Day of Resurrection, the truth will be true, and those whose scales are heavy will be successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, they will have their own souls, because they deny Our revelations.
And indeed We have established you in the earth, and provided therein therein for you. Little little are you grateful.
And indeed We created you, then We gave you the angels, then We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam." They prostrated themselves except Iblis. They prostrated not except Iblis.
He said, "What prevented you?" He said, "I am better than you." He said, "I am better than me. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay."
He said, "Go down from the sky, and do not exult in it. You are the ones who are the losers.
He said, "Allow me respite till the Day of Resurrection."
He said: "You are the most respited of them."
He said, "You have led me astray because of your own souls; I will find you in a way of humiliation."
Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them, from their right, and from their left, and You will not find most of them thankful."
He said, "Depart from the sky, and go away from them, and I will fill you with the fire of Hell."
"O Adam! dwell with your wife and your wife, and eat therefrom therefrom, but do not approach this tree, lest ye be of the wrongdoers."
Then Satan whispered to them in order to whisper to them that which was hidden from them of their shame, and said, "Your Lord has forbidden you from this tree lest you should become angels or become angels."
And he swore to them: "I am indeed a believer.
Then they plotted against them, so they tasted the tree, and when they tasted it, their shame came out of them, and they began to say to themselves, "Did I not forbid you of the tree of the Garden?" And their Lord called them out of the Garden, and said to them, "I did not forbid you of any tree."
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us, do not have mercy on us, we will surely be of the losers."
He said, "Go, you are one of the two enemies of one another, and you are an enemy for the earth and a provision for a time."
He said: Therein shall ye live, and therein shall ye die, and from it shall ye be brought forth.
O children of Adam, We have sent down to you a heavy garment for you, that you may conceal your nakedness and their adornment. That is better for the pious. These are the signs of Allah, so that they may reflect.
O children of Adam! Do not let Satan seduce you in the manner of Satan, as he did not let your parents seduce you, stripping them of their parents, so that their shame may expose them to their shame; and he will not see him from his tribe; they will see you. We have made the devils friends for those who believe.
And when they do commit an indecency, they say: "We found our fathers," and Allah commanded them: "Why do Allah not command those who do wrong?" Say: "Allah does not command the unjust."
Say: "My Lord has commanded justice, and you call your faces on each other, and worship Him with sincere devotion to Him, that you may worship Him, and He will bring you to a new creation."
He has guided the people, and some of them are astray; for they have taken the devils as protectors besides Allah. They have taken the devils as protectors. They think that they are guided.
O Children of Adam! Take the adornment of the Children of Adam, and eat and drink and drink, but do not waste, for He loves not the wasters.
Say: "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has brought forth for His servants, and of the good things?" Say: "They are in the life of this world." Say: "They are in the life of this world, and We do not believe in the Day of Judgment."
Say: "My Lord is only one of what is shameful, and what is hidden, and sin, and oppression that you associate with Allah, and that you associate no partners with Allah, and that you should say to Allah that which you do not know."
And every nation shall have a time appointed for them, but when their term comes, they will not have a single time, nor will they be able to delay.
O children of Adam! If there come to you apostles from among you, relating to you My communications, then whosoever fears Allah and his friends, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
And those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and treat them with arrogance, they are the dwellers of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His revelations? And when Our messengers will be given a portion of them, they will say to them, "Where are you whom you call on besides Allah?" They will say, "Where you call on Allah, they will be called to shame." They will say, "Yes, we will bear witness against us."
He will say: "Enter into the Fire the Fire before you and the people who were before you will be thrown into the faces of the people." When they will enter all together, they will say: "Our Lord! Our Lord! Our Lord has led us astray, so that they may be brought into the Fire." He will say: "Our Lord! Our Lord has led us astray."
And the first of them will say to the last of them: "You are not more than us, so taste the punishment for your deeds."
The gates of the heavens and those who deny Our signs, will not be opened to them in the heaven, nor will they enter Paradise until the eye of the needle will be opened, and they will not enter Paradise, for We shall requite the guilty.
For them shall be the Fire of Hell and coverings of them; and it will be the recompense of those who do wrong. Thus We recompense the wrongdoers.
And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall not impose any burden beyond his scope; they are the dwellers of Paradise; they will abide therein forever.
And We shall bring forth what is in their hearts, and rivers beneath them, and they will say, "Praise be to Allah, who has guided us for us. If Allah had not guided us, we would not have believed in him."
And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of the Fire: "Our Lord! We have promised us what our Lord promised us to do." They said, "Have you found the promise of your Lord?" They will say, "Yes!" They will say, "Yes, God is the curse of the wrongdoers."
Those who hinder from Allah's way and seek to make it crooked, and they will not believe in the Hereafter.
And there will be a barrier between them, and the dwellers of the mountains will know: "The people will know all their marks." They will call out to the companions of the Garden, "Peace be with you." They will not have entered it, and they will not be able to answer.
