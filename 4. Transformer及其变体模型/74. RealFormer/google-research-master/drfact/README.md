## DrFact: A Differentiable Fact-Centric Approach to Open-Ended Commonsense Reasoning

# Under active development

We present a neuro-symbolic commonsense knowledge graph and its natural
language query interface. The knowledge base is based on a corpus of generic
common sense facts. We aim to enable differentiable commonsense reasoning over
the knowledge corpus with indexed contextual representations and higher-order
reasoning. The reasoning model is able to provide a chain of facts for
answering open-ended complex questions, and needs few human annotations.
