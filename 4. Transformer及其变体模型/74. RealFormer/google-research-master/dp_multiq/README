First download the Goodreads dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks.
Save it as "books.csv" in this directory. Then use

> cd ..
> python -m dp_multiq.run_experiment

to run a small number of trials for each of the four data regimes described in
the paper. This will produce and save plots with names eps_1_error_[data].png
and eps_1_times_[data].png.

To fully replicate the experiments from the paper, change the default parameters
in the experiment() function to

num_samples=1000
num_quantiles_range=range(1, 30)
est_num_trials=20
ts_num_trials=5
