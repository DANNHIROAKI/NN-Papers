# Shortcut testing - ShorT

This directory hosts a Python 3 notebook that illustrates the method proposed in [Brown et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10384). We only refer to synthetic data constructed from MNIST [Deng et al., 2012](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6296535) images and use Tensorflow 2 and Keras to build predictive models.
