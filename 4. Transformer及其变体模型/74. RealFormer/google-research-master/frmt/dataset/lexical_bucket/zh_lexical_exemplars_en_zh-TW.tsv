Flip-flops are a type of sandal, typically worn as a form of casual wear.	人字拖是一種涼鞋，通常是一種休閒服飾。
They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap known as a toe thong that passes between the first and second toes and around both sides of the foot or can be a hard base with a strap across all the toes (these can also be called sliders).	由一個扁平的鞋底組成，一條Y形的帶子鬆散地固定在腳上，稱為腳趾丁字帶，穿過第一和第二腳趾之間以及腳兩側，或者可以是一個硬底座，在所有腳趾上都有一條帶子（這些也可以稱為滑塊）。
This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures throughout the world, originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 1,500 B.C.	這種鞋類風格一直由世界各地許多文化的人們穿著，最早起源於公元前1500年的古埃及人。
In the United States the flip-flop descends from the Japanese zōri, which became popular after World War II as soldiers brought them back from Japan.	在美國，人字拖起源於日本zōri，二戰後，當士兵從日本帶回來時，日本zōri變得很受歡迎。
They became popular unisex summer footwear starting in the 1960s.	自1960年代開始，人字拖成為流行的中性夏季鞋類。
The term flip-flop has been used in American and British English since the 1960s to describe the thong or no-heel-strap sandal.	自20世紀60年代以來，人字拖一詞在美國和英國英語中一直用於描述丁字鞋或無跟帶涼鞋。
It is an onomatopoeia of the sound made by the sandals when walking in them.	這是穿著涼鞋行走時發出的聲音的擬聲。
They are called thongs (sometimes pluggers) in Australia, jandals (originally a trademarked name derived from "Japanese sandals") in New Zealand, slops or “visplakkies” in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and tsinelas or step-in in the Philippines (or, in some Visayan localities, "smagol", from the word smuggled).	在澳大利亞，它們被稱為丁字鞋（有時是 plugger），在紐西蘭被稱為jandal（最初是源自「日本涼鞋」的商標名稱），在南非和辛巴威被稱為 slope 或「visplakkies」，在菲律賓被稱為「tsinelas」或「step-in」（或者，在米沙鄢群島部分地區，從單字 smuggled 變化為「smagol」）。
This footwear has a number of other names around the world.	這種鞋子在世界各地還有許多其他名字。
The Japanese wear similarly designed, traditional straw sandals known as zōri.	日本人穿著設計相似的傳統草鞋，被稱為zōri。
Throughout the world, they are known by a variety of other names, including dép tông or dép xỏ ngón in Vietnam, chinelos in Brazil, japonki in Poland, dacas in Somalia, sayonares (σαγιονάρες) in Greece, slippers in Hawaii, Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands, infradito in Italy, djapanki (джапанки) in Bulgaria,"charlie wote" in Ghana, "japanke" in Croatia and vietnamki in Russia and Ukraine, yezenes in Latvia.	在世界各地，它們以各種其他名稱而聞名，包括越南的dép tông或dép xo ngón、巴西的 chinelos、波蘭的 japonki、索馬利亞的 dacas、希臘的 Saonares（σαγιονάρες）、夏威夷、巴哈馬、千里達及托巴哥和荷蘭的 slippers、義大利的 infradito、保加利亞的 djapanki（джапанки）、迦納的「charlie wote」、克羅埃西亞的「japanke」、俄羅斯和烏克蘭的 viernamki、拉脫維亞的 yezenes。
They were introduced by Bata in India under the brand name Hawaii slippers and are extremely popular throughout the country.	Bata公司在印度以夏威夷拖鞋的品牌推出，受到全國熱烈歡迎。
Thong sandals have been worn for thousands of years, dating back to pictures of them in ancient Egyptian murals from 4,000 BC.	人字拖的穿著已有幾千年歷史，最早可追溯到西元前 4000 年的埃及壁畫上。
A pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old.	一雙在歐洲發現的莎草葉製人字拖，約有 1500 年之久。
These early versions of flip-flops were made from a wide variety of materials.	這類早期版本的人字拖，以各種不同材質製作。
Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves.	古埃及以莎草與棕櫚葉製作人字拖。
The Masai of Africa made them out of rawhide.	非洲馬賽人則使用皮革製作。
In India, they were made from wood.	在印度，則以木頭製作。
In China and Japan, rice straw was used.	在中國和日本，則以稻草製作。
The leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America, while the natives of Mexico used the yucca plant.	在南美洲則以西沙爾麻來編成製鞋用的草繩，墨西哥原住民則使用絲蘭。
The Ancient Greeks and Romans wore versions of flip-flops as well.	古希臘和羅馬人也穿各種不同的人字拖。
In Greek sandals, the toe strap was worn between the first and second toes, while Roman sandals had the strap between the second and third toes.	希臘的人字拖，腳趾帶是介於大姆指與食指之間，而羅馬版本則置於食指於中指間。
These differ from the sandals worn by the Mesopotamians, with the strap between the third and fourth toes.	美索不達米亞的人字拖又不同於前者，置於中指於無名指間。
In India, a related chappal ("toe knob") sandal was common, with no straps but a small knob sitting between the first and second toes.	印度的 chappal 鞋（指扣鞋）也很普及，沒有趾帶，但有個鈕扣置於第一與第二指間。
They are known as Padukas.	這類鞋子稱為 Padukas。
The modern flip-flop became popular in the United States as soldiers returning from World War II brought Japanese zōri with them.	在美國當代人字拖的流行，源自二次世界大戰返國的士兵，自日本帶回的 zori。
It caught on in the 1950s during the postwar boom and after the end of hostilities of the Korean War.	正好遇上 1950 年代戰後嬰兒潮與韓戰的結束。
As they became adopted into American popular culture, the sandals were redesigned and changed into the bright colors that dominated 1950s design.	在人字拖為美國流行文化接納之時，鞋款重新設計並導入亮眼色彩，是 1950 年代的主流設計風格。
They quickly became popular due to their convenience and comfort, and were popular in beach-themed stores and as summer shoes.	這類鞋種快速普及，因為方便又舒服，在海灘主題商店很常見，當作夏天的涼鞋。
During the 1960s, flip-flops became firmly associated with the beach lifestyle of California.	1960年代，人字拖與加州的海灘生活方式密不可分。
As such, they were promoted as primarily a casual accessory, typically worn with shorts, bathing suits, or summer dresses.	因此，這類鞋在宣傳時主打當作休閒配件，常與短褲、泳裝和夏季服飾搭配。
As they became more popular, some people started wearing them for dressier or more formal occasions.	因為愈來愈普及，也有人開始在時尚或較正式的場合穿人字拖。
In 1962, Alpargatas marketed a version of flip-flops known as Havaianas in Brazil.	1962 年，Alpargatas 公司在巴西推出一種稱為哈瓦仕的人字拖。
By 2010, more than 150 million pairs of Havaianas were produced each year.	到了 2010年，每年要製造超過 1.5 億雙的哈瓦仕。
Flip-flops quickly became popular as casual footwear of young adults.	人字拖在年輕人之間很快成為熱門休閒鞋類。
Girls would often decorate their flip-flops with metallic finishes, charms, chains, beads, rhinestones, or other jewelry.	女生經常會用金屬飾品、鈴鐺、鍊子、珠子、萊茵石、其他珠寶等來裝飾人字拖。
High-end flip-flops made of leather or sophisticated synthetic materials are commonly worn in place of sneakers or loafers as the standard, everyday article of casual footwear, particularly among teenagers and young adults, although it is not unusual to see older people wearing playful, thick-soled flip-flops in brilliant colors.	高級皮製或高級合成材料製成的人字拖，經常在運動或休閒場所當做標準的每日休閒鞋類，特別是在青少年與年輕人間；不過年紀較長的人不太穿這種色彩搶眼的休閒厚底人字拖。
Platform and high-heel variants began to appear in the 1990s.	1990 年代開始出現厚底和高跟版本。
A minor controversy erupted in 2005 when some members of Northwestern University's national champion women's lacrosse team visited the White House wearing flip-flops.	2005 年，因為部分獲得全國冠軍的西北大學女子曲棍球員，在造訪白宮時穿著人字拖，因此引發了小股爭議。
The team responded to critics by auctioning off their flip-flops on eBay, raising $1,653 USD for young cancer patient, Jaclyn Murphy of Hopewell Junction, New York, who was befriended by the team.	該隊回應批評的方式，是將其人字拖在 eBay 上拍賣，為該隊隊員的朋友，住在紐約的年輕癌症病患 Jaclyn Murphy 募得 1,653 美元。
There is still a debate over whether this signaled a fundamental change in American culture — many youth feel that flip-flops are dressier and can be worn in a variety of social contexts, while older generations feel that wearing them at formal occasions signifies laziness and comfort over style.	這事件是否代表美國文化從根改變，仍有爭議；許多年輕人覺得人字拖是種時尚，可在不同社交場合中穿著，而老一輩的人則覺得在正式場合穿著人字拖，突顯這些貪圖方便舒適，不在乎雅觀。
In 2011, while vacationing in his native Hawaii, Barack Obama became the first President of the United States to be photographed wearing a pair of flip-flops.	2011 年，巴拉克・歐巴馬在家鄉夏威夷度假時，成為第一個被拍到穿著人字拖的美國總統。
The Dalai Lama of Tibet is also a frequent wearer of flip-flops and has met with several U.S. presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, while wearing the sandals.	西藏的達賴喇嘛也經常穿著人字拖，曾經如此會見數名美國總統，包括小布希和歐巴馬。
While exact sales figures for flip-flops are difficult to obtain due to the large number of stores and manufacturers involved, the Atlanta-based company Flip Flop Shops claimed that the shoes were responsible for a $20 billion industry in 2009.	雖然因為有太多商店和製造廠，使得人字拖的精確銷量數字難以取得，但在亞特蘭大的 Flip Flop Shops 說 2009 年的人字拖產值高達 200 億美元。
Furthermore, sales of flip-flops exceeded those of sneakers for the first time in 2006.	更有甚者，2006 年的人字拖銷量超過各類運動鞋。
If these figures are accurate, it is remarkable considering the low cost of most flip-flops.	如果這些數字精確無誤，那就非常可觀，因為大多數人字拖都很便宜。
The modern flip-flop has a very simple design, consisting of a thin rubber sole with two straps running in a Y shape from the sides of the foot to the gap between the big toe and the one beside it.	當代人字拖的設計很簡單，由一個薄橡膠鞋底，配上呈 Y 字型的兩條束帶，從腳板兩側到大姆指與食指中間的縫。
They typically do not have a strap around the heel, although heeled varieties are available, as well as flip-flops designed for sports, which come with added support common to athletic shoes, with the thong between the toes.	腳跟處通常沒有束帶，不過有些變化鞋種有鞋跟，也有專為運動設計的人字拖，在腳趾到腳板間加上常見於運動鞋的加強支撐。
Most modern flip-flops are inexpensive, costing as little as $5 USD, or less in some parts of the world.	大多數的當代人字拖不貴，價格多在 5 美元以下，在世界其他地方還更便宜。
They are made from a wide variety of materials, as were the ancient thong sandals.	製作材質非常多元，就和古代的人字拖一樣。
The modern sandals are made of more modern materials, such as rubber, foam, plastic, leather, suede, and even fabric.	當代的人字拖使用現代的材質，例如橡膠、發泡材質、塑膠、皮革、仿皮，也有用纖維製的。
Thongs made of polyurethane have caused some environmental concerns; because polyurethane is a number 7 resin, they can't be easily discarded, and they persist in landfills for a very long time.	使用聚胺酯製作的鞋面，往往造成環境問題；因為聚胺酯屬於第7類合成品，不可隨意丟棄，且在掩埋場中會持續很長時間無法分解。
In response to these concerns, some companies have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber, such as that from used bicycle tires, or even hemp, and some offer a recycling program for used flip flops.	為了對應這類問題，部分公司開始販售以回收橡膠製成的人字拖，例如使用腳踏車廢胎，甚至使用大麻纖維，也有公司推出回收計畫，回收廢人字拖。
Because of the strap between the toes, flip-flops are typically not worn with socks.	因為在腳趾間會有束帶，所以穿人字拖時通常不穿襪子。
In colder weather, however, some people wear flip-flops with toe socks.	不過天冷時，會有人穿著腳趾襪來穿人字拖。
The Japanese commonly wear tabi, a type of sock with a single slot for the thong, with their zōri.	在日本很普遍的足袋，就是一種可以搭配 zori 穿的單趾襪。
While flip-flops do provide the wearer with some mild protection from hazards on the ground, such as hot sand at the beach, glass, thumb tacks or even fungi and wart-causing viruses in locker rooms or community pools, their simple design is responsible for a host of other injuries of the foot and lower leg.	人字拖雖能提供穿戴者適當的防護，避免他們因踩到海灘上的燙腳沙粒、碎玻璃、圖釘等物品而造成危害，甚或在更衣室或社區泳池感染黴菌和病毒疣，但是其簡樸的設計也會導致足部和小腿等處受到其他傷害。
Walking for long periods in flip-flops can be very tough on the feet, resulting in pain in the ankles, legs, and feet.	穿著人字拖長時間行走可能會讓雙腳十分不適，導致腳踝、腿部和足部疼痛。
A 2009 study at Auburn University found that flip-flop wearers took shorter steps and their heels hit the ground with less vertical force than those wearing athletic shoes.	據奧本大學於 2009 年進行的研究指出，穿著人字拖的人相較於穿著運動鞋的人，前者的行走步距較短且腳跟踩地的垂直作用力也比較弱。
Individuals with flat feet or other foot issues are advised to wear a shoe with better support.	建議有扁平足或其他足部問題的人穿上鞋子，獲得更完善的支撐。
The lack of support provided by thong sandals is thought by some to be a major cause of injuries.	有些人認為缺少支撐的夾腳拖為造成傷害的主要原因之一。
Some flip-flops have a spongy sole, causing the foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground (over-pronation).	有些人字拖的鞋底為海棉材質，導致足部在踩到地面時會過度往內旋轉 (過度內旋)。
Flip-flops can cause a person to overuse the tendons in their feet, resulting in tendonitis.	人字拖會讓人過度使用足部肌腱，進而導致肌腱發炎。
Ankle sprains or broken bones are also common injuries, due to stepping off a curb or tumbling; the ankle bends, but the flip-flop neither holds on to nor supports it.	因為在路緣踩空或絆倒而造成的腳踝扭傷或骨折均為常見傷害。人字拖無法在腳踝扭轉時妥善保護或給予支撐。
The straps of the flip-flop may cause frictional issues, such as rubbing, during walking.	人字拖的綁帶會導致摩擦力問題，例如在行走時磨到腳。
The open-toed nature of the thongs may result in cuts, scrapes, bruises, or stubbed toes.	人字拖會讓腳趾露出來，可能因此造成割傷、刮傷、挫傷或踢傷等問題。
Despite all of these issues, flip-flops do not have to be avoided completely.	儘管會有這些問題出現，但我們也不必完全避開人字拖。
Many podiatrists recommend avoiding the inexpensive, drug store varieties and spending more on sandals with thick-cushioned soles, as well as ones that have a strap that's not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle.	有許多足科醫師建議避免購買廉價的藥妝店款式，而是多花些錢去購買厚底且有軟墊的涼鞋，並附有非帆布材質且位置十分接近腳踝的綁帶。
A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a device used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped shape (though some are covered in plastic).	迴紋針是用來將紙張夾在一起的文具用品，通常是將金屬線彎折成迴圈狀來製作而成 (不過有些會包上一層塑膠膜)。
Most paper clips are variations of the Gem type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire.	大多數的迴紋針都是從在 1890 年代之前問世的寶石 (Gem) 牌迴紋針演變而來，其特色為將金屬線彎折成近乎完整的兩個迴圈。
Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper.	通常迴紋針所運用的是金屬本身的扭轉力和彈力，以及金屬和紙張之間的摩擦力。
When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two "tongues" of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together.	當迴紋針的雙「舌」之間塞入了相當數量的紙張後，會迫使這兩片針舌分開並導致金屬在彎折過後產生扭轉力，進而將這些紙張牢牢夾在一起。
Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes.	迴紋針通常會是兩側筆直的長橢圓形，不過也會出現三角形或圓形，或是更加精心設計的形狀。
The most common material is steel or some other metal, but moulded plastic is also used.	最常使用的材質為鋼鐵或其他金屬，不過也有使用塑膠壓製而成。
Some other kinds of paper clip use a two-piece clamping system.	有些其他種類的迴紋針會使用雙片鉗夾設計。
Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips.	近日來的創新發展包括了七彩繽紛的塑膠包膜迴紋針以及彈簧固定式活頁夾。
According to the Early Office Museum, the first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay in 1867.	根據昔日辦公博物館 (Early Office Museum) 的資料顯示，金屬彎折迴紋針的第一份專利是由美國於 1867 年授予 Samuel B. Fay。
This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together.	儘管這份專利認可它能用來把紙夾在一起，但其實這枚迴紋針原本主要是用來把票券夾在衣服上。
Fay received U.S. patent 64,088 on April 23, 1867.	Fay 於 1867 年 4 月 23 日獲得美國第 64088 號專利。
Although functional and practical, Fay's design along with the 50 other designs patented prior to 1899 are not considered reminiscent of the modern paperclip design known today.	Fay 的設計以及在 1899 年之前的另外 50 項專利設計儘管都十分實用且務實，但其實都不太會讓人聯想到今日廣為人知的現代版迴紋針設計。
Another notable paper clip design was also patented in the United States by Erlman J. Wright in 1877.	另一款引人注目的迴紋針設計，則是由 Erlman J. Wright 在 1877 年獲得美國專利認可。
This clip was advertised at that time for use in fastening newspapers.	這款迴紋針在當時是以其能夠扣緊報紙來打廣告。
The most common type of wire paper clip still in use, the Gem paper clip, was never patented, but it was most likely in production in Britain in the early 1870s by "The Gem Manufacturing Company", according to the American expert on technological innovations, Professor Henry J. Petroski.	目前最常見且一直還有人使用的金屬線圈迴紋針 (即寶石牌迴紋針) 反而從未獲得專利。據美國的科技創新專家 Henry J. Petroski 教授表示，這款迴紋針很有可能是在 1870 年代早期，由英國的「寶石公司」負責製造生產。
He refers to an 1883 article about "Gem Paper-Fasteners", praising them for being "better than ordinary pins" for "binding together papers on the same subject, a bundle of letters, or pages of a manuscript".	他引述了一篇 1883 年關於「寶石牌紙夾」的文章，文內盛讚這款紙夾「比一般的別針更好用」，能夠「將內容主題相同的紙張、一堆信件或是好幾頁手稿夾在一起」。
Since the 1883 article had no illustration of this early "Gem", it may have been different from modern paper clips of that name.	因為這篇 1883 年的文章並未附上這款早年的「寶石牌」的示意圖，所以可能會跟現代所謂的迴紋針有所差異。
The earliest illustration of its current form is in an 1893 advertisement for the "Gem Paper Clip".	最早繪製出其目前樣式的示意圖，出現在 1893 年的「寶石牌迴紋針」廣告文宣中。
In 1904 Cushman & Denison registered a trademark for the "Gem" name in connection with paper clips.	1904 年，Cushman & Denison 註冊了與迴紋針有關的「寶石牌」商標。
The announcement stated that it had been used since March 1, 1892, which may have been the time of its introduction in the United States.	這份公告表明了這項商標在 1892 年 3 月 1 日之前都還沒有人用過，也可能就是在這個時候來引進到美國境內。
Paper clips are still sometimes called "Gem clips", and in Swedish the word for any paper clip is "gem".	迴紋針現在有時候還是會被稱作是「寶石夾」。在瑞典文中，迴紋針的通稱即為「寶石」。
Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest, is the patent granted to William Middlebrook of Waterbury, Connecticut on April 27 of that year for a "Machine for making wire paper clips." The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type.	目前能確切證明現代款式的迴紋針最晚在 1899 年就廣為人知的證據，為那一年 4 月 27 日於康乃狄克州的瓦特柏利授予 William Middlebrook 的「金屬線圈迴紋針製造機」專利。圖中能清楚看見這台機器製造出寶石牌款式的精美迴紋針。
The fact that Middlebrook did not mention it by name, suggests that it was already well known at the time.	Middlebrook 當時並未提及品牌名稱，由此可見這款迴紋針在那個時候已經廣為人知。
Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented.	自此之後，由相同主題款式演變出來的各種設計都陸續獲得專利認可。
Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip.	有些採用尖頭設計取代圓頭設計，有些會稍微彎折一下其中一個迴圈的尾端，使其更容易夾入紙張，有些則會將金屬線彎折成波浪形或倒鉤狀，讓它能夾得更緊。
In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular, star, or round shapes.	除此之外，純粹追求美感呈現的不同設計也獲得了專利，比如三角形、星形或圓形的迴紋針。
But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular.	不過，原始的寶石牌款式則風行了超過百年之久，在在證明它是最實用且持續穩坐人氣寶座的王者。
Its qualities—ease of use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling—have been difficult to improve upon.	它的品質 (方便使用、緊扣而不怕撕裂，且儲存時不會相互勾纏) 已經好到難以再多做改良了。
National Paperclip Day is May 29.	5 月 29 日是全國迴紋針日。
It has been claimed, though apparently without evidence, that Herbert Spencer, the originator of the term "survival of the fittest", invented the paper clip.	儘管沒有確切證據足以證明，但據說當年是曾寫下「適者生存」的 Herbert Spencer 發明了迴紋針。
Spencer claimed in his autobiography to have invented a "binding-pin" that was distributed by Ackermann & Company, and he shows a drawing of the pin in his Appendix I (following Appendix H).	Spencer 在他的自傳中宣稱自己發明了一款由阿克曼公司 (Ackermann & Company) 負責分銷的「裝訂別針」，而且他還在附錄 I (在附錄 H 的後面) 中附上了圖稿。
This pin looked more like a modern cotter pin than a modern paper clip, but it was designed to hold sheets of paper together.	這款別針看起來比較像是現代的髮夾而非迴紋針，不過它原先的設計就是用來將紙張夾在一起。
It is approximately 15 cm unfolded.	展開來約莫有 15 公分長。
A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866–1910), has erroneously been identified as the inventor of the paper clip.	挪威的 Johan Vaaler (1866–1910) 向來被誤認為是迴紋針的發明者。
He was granted patents in Germany and in the United States (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire.	他在德國和美國 (1901 年) 都曾以類似設計的迴紋針獲得專利認可，不過相較之下不太實用，金屬線的部分也少了最後的扭轉收尾。
Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway.	Vaaler 大概並不知道市面上已經有更優質的產品，儘管當時也尚未引進到挪威。
His version was never manufactured and never marketed, because the superior Gem was already available.	他的版本從未生產製造也從未在市面上販售，因為當時已經有穩佔上風的寶石牌了。
Long after Vaaler's death his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognised Norwegian genius.	在 Vaaler 過世了好一陣子之後，他的同鄉創造出一個流傳全國的民間傳說，誤稱迴紋針是由一位籍籍無名的挪威天才所發明。
Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip, and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips.	自 1950 年代以降的挪威辭典都說 Vaaler 是迴紋針的發明人，而且這則民間傳說之後還被納入國際辭典和諸多有關迴紋針的國際文獻。
Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of more useful paper clips, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions.	儘管當時早就存在更實用的迴紋針，但 Vaaler 大概還是順利以自己的設計獲得了海外專利，因為那時候的專利認證機構相當自由開放，且會獎勵各種針對現有發明稍作修改的成果。
Johan Vaaler began working for Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor in Kristiania in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death.	Johan Vaaler 於 1892 年開始受僱於奧斯陸的 Alfred J. Bryns 專利工程師，並在之後晉升為經理，一路做到他逝世為止。
As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway.	身為專利辦公室的職員，他可以輕易在挪威獲得專利認可。
His reasons for applying abroad are not known; it is possible that he wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally.	至於他為何要申請海外專利，不得而知。有可能是他想要維護在國際上進行商業貿易的權利。
Also, he may have been aware that a Norwegian manufacturer would find it difficult to introduce a new invention abroad, starting from the small home market.	此外，他可能有注意到從小家庭市場起家的挪威製造商會難以將新發明推廣到海外市場。
Vaaler's patents expired quietly, while the "Gem" was used worldwide, including his own country.	Vaaler 的專利在悄無聲息間過了期，「寶石牌」則風行世界各地，包含了他自己的家鄉。
The failure of his design was its impracticality.	他的設計錯誤在於其並不實用。
Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip.	由於少了研發完善的迴紋針所擁有的兩個完整迴圈，紙張難以夾進他的迴紋針。
One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle.	雖然我們可以調整一下內側的金屬線，讓紙比較好夾進去，但外側的金屬線卻讓人束手無策，因為這款迴紋針無法利用到扭轉原理。
The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper.	這款迴紋針反而會像是脊椎般將紙張垂直撐起來。
The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.	只要切掉寶石牌迴紋針的外圈和一段長邊，就能輕易展示 Vaaler 的設計有多不實用。
The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country.	挪威發明迴紋針的民間傳說起源自一位挪威的國家專利代理人。他為了在德國登記註冊挪威的海外專利，在 1920 年代造訪了德國。
He came across Vaaler's patent, but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip.	他翻閱到 Vaaler 的專利認證，卻未能察覺這和當時常見的寶石牌迴紋針並不相同。
In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip.	在所任職的專利代理機構的五十週年報告書中，他宣稱 Vaaler 發明了日常所見的迴紋針。
This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.	這一段話在第二次世界大戰之後被收錄到某些挪威的百科全書當中。
Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip.	那場世界大戰讓關於迴紋針的神秘傳說更加甚囂塵上。
Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway were forbidden.	由於鑲有旗幟的別針和暗指被迫流亡的挪威哈康七世的別針都陸續遭禁，愛國人士紛紛將迴紋針別在制服衣領上，當作抵禦侵佔國土的德軍和納粹政權的象徵。
Those wearing them did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time.	當時那些配戴迴紋針的愛國人士並未將其視為國族象徵，因為關於其起源自挪威的傳說尚未廣泛流傳。
The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity ("we are bound together").	迴紋針在當時代表著團結一心 (「我們彼此牢牢扣在一起」)。 
The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them could risk severe punishment.	配戴迴紋針的行為很快就遭到禁止，並祭出嚴厲處分。
The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952, but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention.	首屈一指的挪威百科全書在 1952 年的增補本中提到了迴紋針是抵禦外侮的象徵，但是並未宣稱其為挪威發明的產物。
That information was added in later editions.	挪威發明等言詞則是在之後的版本才加了進去。
According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in France.	根據 1974 年版的內文，使用迴紋針來表示抵禦決心的做法起源自法國。
A clip worn on a lapel or front pocket could be seen as "deux gaules" (two posts or poles) and be interpreted as a reference to the leader of the French Resistance, General Charles de Gaulle.	配戴在衣領或前胸口袋的迴紋針看起來猶如「雙柱」或「雙桿」 (法語為「deux gaules」，音似「戴高樂」)，可視為意指法國抵抗運動的領導人，查爾斯戴高樂將軍。
The post-war years saw a widespread consolidation of the paper clip as a national symbol.	在大戰結束後的數年間，將迴紋針當做國族象徵的想法廣為流傳且深植民心。
Authors of books and articles on the history of Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial.	許多撰寫挪威科技史相關書籍和文章的作者抓緊機會大書特書，讓原本內容單薄的故事更加充實且豐富。
They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the fully developed Gem-type clip.	他們選擇忽視 Vaaler 的迴紋針與研發完善的寶石牌迴紋針並不相同的事實。
In 1989 a giant paper clip, almost 7 m (23 ft) high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler.	1989 年，一座將近 7 公尺 (23 英尺) 高的巨大迴紋針聳立在鄰近奧斯陸的一間商學院校園中，為了紀念 Vaaler 的發明榮獲專利認可滿九十週年。不過這座紀念碑的造型卻是寶石牌迴紋針，而非 Vaaler 當年取得專利的樣式。
The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the paper clip culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent.	1999 年，在 Vaaler 完成提交德國專利申請的百年之後，關於挪威發明迴紋針的傳聞的慶祝聲勢達到最高峰。
A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness.	那一年發行了一款紀念郵票，就此展開一系列宣揚挪威發明實力的活動。
The background shows a facsimile of the German "Patentschrift".	郵票背景為那份德國「專利說明書」的複本。
However, the figure in the foreground is not the paper clip depicted on that document, but the much better known "Gem".	然而前面的圖案卻不是在那份專利說明書中描繪的迴紋針，而是更廣為人知的「寶石牌」。
In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (Norsk biografisk leksikon) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the paper clip.	2005 年，挪威的國家人物傳記百科全書出版了 Johan Vaaler 的個人傳記，稱其為迴紋針的發明人。
Wire is versatile in its nature.	金屬線本身就具有多元用途。
Thus a paper clip is a useful accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force.	因此，迴紋針在諸多機械作業中都是相當實用的配件，包括電腦作業：金屬線只要稍加施力就能展開。
Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need.	有許多儀器裝置需要極為細小的長桿來壓下陷進去外殼裡的按鈕。使用者平常鮮少需要接觸到這顆按鈕。
This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an "emergency eject" should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh).	這顆按鈕，在大多數的光碟機上是會在電源失常時用到的「緊急退出」鈕。這也會出現在早期的軟碟機上 (包括早期的麥金塔電腦)。
Various smartphones require the use of a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device.	有各式各樣的智慧型手機需要使用如迴紋針般的細長的物件來退出 SIM 卡，也有些 Palm PDA 裝置會建議使用迴紋針來重新設定裝置。
The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel.	早期的羅技滑鼠裝置會使用迴紋針來打開檔板，藉此取出軌跡球。
A paper clip bent into a "U" can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header).	彎折成「U」字形的迴紋針可以用來在未實際連接到主機板的狀況下開啟 ATX PSU (將綠線連接到主機板接頭的黑線)。
One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a RS232 interface (or indeed many interfaces).	單枚或多枚迴紋針可以用來製作適用於 RS232 介面 (或是其他諸多介面) 的迴環裝置。
A paper clip could be installed in a Commodore 1541 disk-drive as a flexible head-stop.	迴紋針可以安裝在 Commodore 1541 磁碟機中，當成具有彈性的磁頭停桿。
A paper clip can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse.	迴紋針可以暫時用來銜接熔斷絲 (但並不安全)。
The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.	牙科可以使用迴紋針的金屬線來做成牙釘。
Paper clips can be bent into a crude but sometimes effective lock picking device.	迴紋針可以彎折成簡陋但有時候還挺有用的開鎖工具。
Some types of handcuffs can be unfastened using paper clips.	有些類型的手銬可以用迴紋針解開。
There are two approaches.	解鎖方法有兩種。
The first one is to unfold the clip in a line and then twist the end in a right angle, trying to imitate a key and using it to lift the lock fixator.	第一種是先將迴紋針扳直成一條線，然後將一端扭成適合的折角，用來仿照鑰匙將鎖頭的固定榫撬開。
The second approach, which is more feasible but needs some practice, is to use the semi-unfolded clip kink for lifting when the clip is inserted through the hole where the handcuffs are closed.	第二種方法較為可行，但需要多練習個幾次，那就是將展開一半的迴紋針插入手銬閉鎖處的孔隙，然後試著將它撬開。
A paper clip image is the standard image for an attachment in an email client.	迴紋針圖案是在電子郵件客戶端用來表示附件的標準圖案。
In 1994, the US imposed anti-dumping tariffs against China, on paper clips.	1994 年，美國針對從中國進口的迴紋針課徵反傾銷關稅。
The Band-Aid was invented in 1920 by a Johnson & Johnson employee, Earle Dickson in Highland Park, New Jersey for his wife Josephine, who frequently cut and burned herself while cooking.	Band-Aid OK 繃是由嬌生公司 (Johnson & Johnson) 的員工於 1920 年所發明。這位員工是住在紐澤西州高地公園的 Earle Dickson，他為了經常在煮飯時切到或燙到自己的妻子 Josephine 發明了這項產品。
The prototype allowed her to dress her wounds without assistance.	這款 OK 繃的原型能夠讓她自行處理自己的傷口。
Dickson passed the idea on to his employer, which went on to produce and market the product as the Band-Aid.	Dickson 將這個點子遞交給他的主管，隨後就進行量產，並以 Band-Aid 做為產品名稱在市場上販售。
Dickson had a successful career at Johnson & Johnson, rising to vice president before his retirement in 1957.	Dickson 在嬌生公司的職涯一帆風順，於 1957 年退休之前晉升為副總裁。
Perhaps a curiosity, the word "Band" in German means tape.	補充一個小知識，「Band」這個字在德文中有「膠帶」之意。
The original Band-Aids were handmade and not very popular.	原版的 Band-Aid OK 繃是以手工製成，在當時並未受到歡迎。
By 1924, Johnson & Johnson introduced machine-made Band-Aids and began the sale of sterilized Band-Aids in 1939.	到了 1924 年，嬌生公司推出由機器製成的 Band-Aid OK 繃，並於 1939 年開始銷售無菌版 OK 繃。
In 1951, the first decorative Band-Aids were introduced.	1951 年，第一款具有圖案裝飾的 Band-Aid OK 繃正式問世。
They continue to be a commercial success, with such themes as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Oliver & Jenny, Superman, Spider-Man, Rocket Power, Rugrats, smiley faces, Barbie, Dora the Explorer, Batman and Duck Dynasty.	這類 OK 繃的銷售業績持續長紅，相繼推出米老鼠、唐老鴨、《奧麗華歷險記》(Oliver & Jenny)、超人、蜘蛛人、《火箭動力》(Rocket Power)、《淘氣小兵兵》(Rugrats)、笑臉圖案、芭比娃娃、《愛探險的朵拉》(Dora the Explorer)、蝙蝠俠和《鴨子王朝》(Duck Dynasty) 等聯名主題款式。
In World War II, millions were shipped overseas, helping popularize the product.	在二次大戰期間，有上百萬片 OK 繃被運送到海外，助長了這項產品的銷售人氣。
Since then, Johnson & Johnson currently has estimated a sale of over 100 billion Band-Aids worldwide.	自此之後，據嬌生公司估算，目前 Band-Aid OK 繃已經在全球銷售超過千億片。
Johnson & Johnson continues to defend the Band-Aid trademark against it being genericized.	嬌生公司至今持續力守 Band-Aid 這個商標，不讓它成為通用名稱。
Band-Aid arguably has, over time, become a genericized trademark in the United States, and a generic term cannot function as a trademark; but Johnson & Johnson has registered Band-Aid as a trademark on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the registration is valid and legal.	「Band-Aid」一詞隨著時間的推移，至今可說是美國境內的通用商標，成為不具有專用商標資格的通俗名稱。但嬌生公司其實已經在美國專利商標局的主要註冊簿上將 Band-Aid 註冊為專用商標，而且該項註冊至今仍有效且合法。
A registration on the Principal Register does not create ownership rights under the laws of the United States, and a registration may be challenged and removed if the challenger proves as a matter of fact that the alleged trademark has become generic.	根據美國的相關法律規範，在主要註冊簿上註冊商標並不等同於具有該商標的所有權。如果有人對某個註冊商標提出異議，並提供事實證明該商標已經成為通用名稱，則該註冊商標有可能會遭到質疑或移除。
To protect the name, their trademark, Johnson & Johnson always refers to its products as "BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages", not just "Band-Aid".	嬌生公司為保護自身商標權益，一律將這項產品稱為「BAND-AID® 牌黏性繃帶」，而非只是「Band-Aid」。
