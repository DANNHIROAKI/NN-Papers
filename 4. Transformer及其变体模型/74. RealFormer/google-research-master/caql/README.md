CAQL, Continuous Action Q-Learning, is a class of algorithms for continuous-action Q-learning that can use several plug-and-play optimizers for the max-Q problem.

NOTE: MIP optimizer is not included in this initial version because the MIP optimizer is a Google-internal library and has not been open-sourced yet. However, it has a plan for open-source, and we will update this repository as soon as it is released.

For technical details of CAQL, refer to ICLR 2020 paper (https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkxXe0Etwr)
