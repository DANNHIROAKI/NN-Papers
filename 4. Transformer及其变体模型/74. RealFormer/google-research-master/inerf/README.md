# iNeRF: Inverting Neural Radiance Fields for Pose Estimation

pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05877.pdf
project website: http://yenchenlin.me/inerf/

## Warning

This colab doesn't work at the moment, it needs integration with the public version of jaxnerf (https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/jaxnerf).

## Instructions

This is a self-contained colab which contains an implementation for a subset of the functionality presented in iNeRF.
