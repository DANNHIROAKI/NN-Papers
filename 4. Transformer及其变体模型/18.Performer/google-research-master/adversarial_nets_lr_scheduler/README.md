# Mind the (optimality) Gap: A Gap-Aware Learning Rate Scheduler for Adversarial Nets
This repository contains an implementation and a demo of the learning rate
scheduler proposed in [*Mind the (optimality) Gap: A Gap-Aware Learning
Rate Scheduler for Adversarial Nets*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00089)
(AISTATS, 2023). The scheduler stabilizes the training of adversarial nets
(e.g., GANs) by dynamically modifying the learning rate. See the paper for
more details.

# Usage
See the colab (demo.ipynb) in this repo.
