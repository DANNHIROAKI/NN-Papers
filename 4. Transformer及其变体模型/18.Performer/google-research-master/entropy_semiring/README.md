# Revisiting the Entropy Semiring for Neural Speech Recognition.
https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SNgLnzFQeiD

We show code for the following:
1) CTC and RNN-T in the semiring framework.
2) Example implementation of the entropy semiring, which is helpful for applications like regularization and distillation.

Please look at the test files for examples of small CTC and RNN-T lattices that are computed by hand. Please verify that our code produces the correct output for these examples.
