# Code excerpts from the flood forecasting inundation models

This directory contains a colab with some code excerpt from the Google flood forecasting inundation modelling code. These code excerpts are shared as part of the "*Flood forecasting with machine learning models in an operational framework*" paper, and describe the inundation modelling algorithms as were used by the flood forecasting operational framework during 2021.
