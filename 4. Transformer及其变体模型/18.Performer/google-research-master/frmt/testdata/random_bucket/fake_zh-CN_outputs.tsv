However, we will encounter the mistake of the pleasure of denouncing the entire thing to open, and the things that the discoveror of the truth and as an architect of the blessed life are explained.	但是，我们将发现谴责整个事物开放的乐趣以及发现真理和作为祝福生活的建筑师的事物的荣幸。
For no one is the pleasure of pleasure to be rejected or hates or escaped, but because they follow the great pains of those who are in a pleasure to follow them.	因为没有人是被拒绝，讨厌或逃脱的乐趣，而是因为他们跟随那些有快乐的人的巨大痛苦。
Nor is there any pain that is carrots, enhanced, wants to obtain, but because it is not never to the same time to work, and the pain of a great pleasure.	也没有胡萝卜，改善，想要获得的痛苦，但是因为它从来没有同时工作和愉悦的痛苦。
For example, to the tiny pardon, who is our exercise any of the body receives laborious, but to do something out of the advantage of the consequences?	例如，对于小宽恕，我们的锻炼是谁，任何身体都可以接受工作，但要做一些超出后果的优势？
Who or the right to criticize those who want to be a pleasure to achieve no discomfort or to avoid the pain that no pleasure to be prepared?	谁或有权批评那些想成为不适感或避免没有准备好痛苦的人？
