Between 1978-1985 alongside the market-based Chinese economic reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping, Dongfeng was transformed from a manufacturer of two heavy-duty trucks with fragmented operations and ownership into a single, centrally managed enterprise.	1978-1985年间，伴随着邓小平制定的以市场为基础的中国经济改革，东风公司从一家生产两种重型卡车、业务和所有权极为分散的制造企业，转变为一家集中管理的单一企业。
This process included placing all Dongfeng operations—from part manufacture to vehicle assembly—under the control of a single business entity and the merger of six truck production bases as well as a number of other companies previously controlled by provincial governments.	这一过程包括将东风公司的所有业务——从零件制造到车辆组装——由一个单一的商业实体来控制，合并六个卡车生产基地和以前由省政府控制的其他一些公司。
Post-1985, further reforms took place that allowed Dongfeng greater autonomy; the company was removed from the direct administrative control of the central government.	1985 年后，进一步的改革使东风公司获得了更大的自主权；该公司脱离了中央政府的直接行政管辖。

Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant; Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong, which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.	屠呦呦发现，可采用低温提取工艺从该植物中分离出一种有效的抗疟物质；屠呦呦表示，自己受传统中医资料《肘后备急方》的影响，此书由葛洪写于公元 340 年，书中写明这种草药应当冷水浸泡。
This book contained the direction to immerse a handful of qinghao in the equivalent of two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all.	这本书中所写的方法是将一把青蒿浸泡在两升水中，绞出汁液并全部喝下。

The airport was built in 1936 during Japanese rule with its origins as a Japanese military airbase, the Taihoku Airfield (Japanese: 臺北飛行場 Hepburn: Taihoku Hikōjō), also known as Matsuyama Airfield (松山飛行場).	该机场建于 1936 年日据时期，最初为日本军用空军基地“台北飞行场”，又称“松山飞行场”。
After World War II, in 1946, it was taken over by the Republic of China Air Force.	二战后，于 1946 年由中华民国空军接管。
Before the end of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the airport provided flight routes between Shanghai and Taipei, occasionally via Fuzhou.	在国共内战结束和中华人民共和国成立之前，该机场提供上海与台北之间的航班，偶尔途经福州。
Shared military and civilian use—both domestic and international—began on 16 April 1950 in the reconstructed Civil Aeronautics Administration Taipei Airport (交通部民用航空局台北航空站).	1950 年 4 月 16 日，在重建后的“交通部”民用航空局台北航空站开启军民共享，既有国内的也有国际的。
Domestic destinations have been Kaohsiung, Hualien, Taichung, Penghu, and Tainan.	境内目的地有高雄、花莲、台中、澎湖和台南。
The first international destinations were Seattle, Tokyo, Pusan, Manila, Bangkok, and Hong Kong.	第一批国际目的地为西雅图、东京、釜山、马尼拉、曼谷和香港。
The first international airlines included Northwest Airlines, Pan American Airlines, and Hong Kong Airways (now Cathay Pacific).	首批国际航空公司包括西北航空、泛美航空和香港航空（现在的国泰航空）。
Later, the airport became too small to handle an increased number of passengers, even after a series of expansions.	后来，即使经过一系列扩建，机场也不足以处理增加的乘客数量。
This later worsened when new wide-body jets became common at the airport.	之后，当新的宽体式喷气飞机成为机场常客时，这种情况就恶化了。
Therefore, all international activities were relocated to Taoyuan International Airport (then known as Chiang Kai-shek International) after its inauguration on 26 February 1979.	因此，1979 年 2 月 26 日桃园国际机场（当时名为中正国际机场）启用后，所有的国际活动都迁往该机场。
Consequently, the passenger load at the airport dropped from 6.2 million in 1978 to 2.9 million in 1979 (a 53% decrease).	机场客运量因此从 1978 年的 620 万降至 1979 年的 290 万（减少53%）。
At its peak in 1997, the airport handled over 15.3 million passengers annually.	在 1997 年的高峰期，该机场年处理 1530 多万旅客。
Service to Taichung and Chiayi was stopped in mid-2007 after the load factor dropped significantly due to Taiwan High Speed Rail start of revenue service in January 2007.	由于台湾高铁从 2007 年 1 月开始提供收入服务，使得载客率大幅下降，至台中和嘉义的服务于 2007 年中停止。
Passenger volume decreased from 6.7 million in 2006 to 4.4 million in 2007 (a 34% decrease).	客运量从 2006 年的 670 万减少到 2007 年的 440 万（减少34%）。
Also due to the opening of the high speed rail line, on 1 March 2008, Uni Air suspended its service to Kaohsiung, while Far Eastern Air Transport suspended its service to Tainan.	同样由于高铁线路开通，2008年1月立荣航空暂停了至高雄的服务，而远东航空也暂停了至台南的服务。
TransAsia Airways decided to stop flights to Tainan and Kaohsiung after 1 August 2008.	复兴航空决定 2008 年 8 月 1 日之后，停飞至台南和高雄的航班。
In early 1999 when the construction of Taipei 101 had just started, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration changed this airport's certain SID and STAR procedures to avoid possible collision with the building.	1999 年初，当台北 101 大厦刚开始动工时，台湾的交通部民用航空局更改了该机场的某些 SID 和 STAR 程序，以避免与该楼相撞。
The 677-meter Fuxing North Road Underground Passage (復興北路車行地下道) was constructed between 1997 and 2006 under this airport's runway to link the north and south side of this airport.	677 米长的复兴北路车行地下道从 1997 年至 2006 年修建于该机场跑道地下，用于连接该机场南北两侧。
Regular cross-Strait charter flights to China started on 4 July 2008, with Songshan receiving the majority of flights.	2008 年 7 月 4 日，两岸定期包机开通，松山机场接收大部分航班。
Direct flights to China were an issue of contention.	至中国大陆的直飞航班是一个有争议的问题。
Then-mayor Ma Ying-jeou had been pressing to make Songshan Airport Taipei's main International terminal, citing that its location close to the city center would make it preferable for business travelers.	时任市长马英九一直极力要求把松山机场作为台北的主要国际航站楼，理由是其位置靠近市中心，更适合商旅人士。
However, building height restrictions around the airport raised concerns about flight safety, blocking of radio communications, noise pollution, and a reduced number of flights.	但机场周围的建筑高度限制，引起人们对飞行安全、无线电通讯受阻、噪音污染和航班数量减少的担忧。
The continuing growth of Taipei City means that Songshan airport is situated in the heart of downtown Taipei.	台北市的持续增长意味着松山机场坐落于台北市中心的核心地带。
Compared to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Songshan Airport saves travelers about 30 minutes due to its location inside Taipei City's central business district, but the city suffers from the noise, pollution, restrictions on urban planning, and traffic congestion the airport brings about.	与台湾桃园国际机场相比，由于在台北市的中央商务区内，松山机场可为旅客节省约30分钟时间，但该市却饱受机场带来的噪音、污染、城市规划限制和交通拥堵的困扰。
In the 2002 and 2006 Taipei Mayor Election DPP candidates Lee Ying-yuan and Frank Hsieh both proposed the plan to close Songshan Airport, and developed its land into road, huge park, detention basin and sports arena, since the Taiwan High Speed Rail could quickly take up the traffic load between Taipei and western Taiwan cities, and the remaining service to outlying islands and eastern Taiwan could be easily taken over by the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after the completion of Taoyuan International Airport Access MRT System by the end of 2016.	在 2002 年和 2006 年的台北市长选举中，民进党候选人李应元和谢长廷都提议关闭松山机场，并将其土地开发为道路、大型公园、泄洪池以及体育场，理由是台湾高铁可以迅速承担起台北和台湾西部城市之间的交通负荷，而到2016年底，桃园国际机场通道捷运系统建成后，其余至离岛和台湾东部的服务可由台湾桃园国际机场轻松承担。
Also, the MRT system will make the international potential of Songshan airport less attractive.	此外，捷运系统将令松山机场的国际潜力失去吸引力。
The Songshan Airport closing proposal was deferred under the Taipei City Government which has long been dominated by the Pan-Blue Coalition, who prefers the downtown airport connection concept with Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo.	关闭松山机场的提案被台北市政府推迟，该市政府长期以来一直由泛蓝联盟主导，他们更倾向于上海、首尔和东京的市中心机场连接的概念。
Due to the introduction of Taiwan-China flights and future international potential, the airport is undergoing extensive renovations, the first phase of which is expected to be completed by October 2010.	由于开通两岸航班和未来的国际潜力，该机场正在进行大范围翻修，第一阶段预计将在 2010 年 10 月完成。

However, as of November 2011 renovations are still in progress.	但截至 2011 年 11 月，翻新工作仍在进行。
A new international cargo terminal is being built in anticipation of a new air route between Taiwan and Japan.	为迎接台湾与日本之间的新航线，正在建设一座新的国际货运航站楼。

On 29 March 2011, the renovated Terminal 2 was re-opened to handle domestic flights.	2011 年 3 月 29 日，翻修一新的 2 号航站楼重新开放，用于接待国内航班。
Songshan Airport is seen to have the potential to attract business travelers within Pacific Asia due to its location in downtown Taipei.	由于地处台北市中心，松山机场被认为有潜力吸引亚太地区的商务旅客。
Flights to Bangkok–Don Mueang, Jakarta–Halim Perdanakusuma, Kuala Lumpur–Subang, Singapore–Seletar, Nagoya–Komaki, Osaka–Itami, Seoul–Gimpo, Shanghai–Hongqiao, Beijing–Nanyuan, and Tokyo–Haneda are especially attractive since these airports are also in the central areas of their respective cities, and all these cities have larger far flung international airports.	前往曼谷-廊曼机场、雅加达-哈利姆·珀达纳库苏马机场、吉隆坡-梳邦机场、新加坡-实里达机场、名古屋-小牧机场、大阪-伊丹机场、首尔-金浦机场、上海-虹桥机场、北京-南苑机场、东京-羽田机场的航班特别吸引人，因为这些机场也都位于各自城市的中心地区，所有这些城市都有更大更远的国际机场。
The airport is currently in the process of expansion to better accommodate international flights.	机场目前正在扩建，以便更好地适应国际航班。
On 6 March 2009, Japan and Taiwan signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the revision of Taiwan–Japan bilateral traffic.	2009 年 3 月 6 日，日本与台湾签署了一份关于修改台日双边交通的谅解备忘录。

The first suncakes were made by the Lin family in the She-Ko area of Shengang Township, Taichung County (now part of Taichung City).	第一批太阳饼由台中县（现属台中市）神岗乡社高地区的林氏家族制作。
The Lin family used condensed malt sugar as a filling for cake pastries.	林家使用浓缩麦芽糖作为糕点馅料。
Later on, pastry maker Wei Qing-hai modified the cakes to their current form.	后来糕点师魏清海将糕点改良成现在的样子。

The name was not trademarked, and other pastry shops have used the same name for their own suncakes.	这个名称并未注册商标，其他糕饼店对自家的太阳饼也使用同样的名称。
Shenyang literally means "the Yang side of the Shen River", referring to the location of the Hun River (formerly called the Shen River, 瀋水; Shěn Shuǐ), on the southern side of the city.	沈阳的字面意思是“沈河的阳面”，指的是浑河（以前叫“沈水”）的位置，位于城市南面。
According to Chinese tradition, a river's north bank and a mountain's south slope are considered to be the "sunny" – or "Yang" – side.	根据中国传统，河的北岸和山的南坡被视为“阳”面。
Archaeological findings show that humans resided in present-day Shenyang as early as 8,000 years ago.	考古发现表明，早在 8000 年前就有人类居住在今天的沈阳。

The city, now known as Shenyang, was first established in about 300 BCE during the Warring States period by Yan general Qin Kai, who conquered the Liaodong region, and was then named Hou City (侯城; Hóu Chéng).	这座城市，也就是现在的沈阳，最早是在公元前300年战国时期，由征服辽东地区的燕国将领秦开建立，当时名为“侯城”。
However, around 350 years later during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han, the city was sacked and burnt by the Donghu nomads and subsequently abandoned.	然而，大约 350 年后，这座城市在汉光武帝时期遭东胡游牧民族洗劫焚毁，随后被废弃。
It came back to prominence during early Liao dynasty and was known as the Shen Prefecture (瀋州; Shěn Zhōu) through to the end of Jin dynasty, and became the Shenyang Circuit (瀋陽路; Shěnyáng Lù) during the Yuan dynasty.	辽代初期，这座城市又开始崭露头角，直至金朝末年，一直被称为“沈州”，在元朝时成为“沈阳路”。
During the Ming dynasty, it was designated as a "guard town" (militarized settlements, such as walled/heavily garrisoned cities or towns) named Shenyang Central Guard (瀋陽中衛; Shěnyáng Zhōngwèi) and gradually became one of the most important strongholds beyond the Shanhai Pass.	明朝时，被指定为“卫城”（军事化的定居点，比如有城墙/重兵把守的城市或镇），名为“沈阳中卫”，逐渐成为山海关外最重要的据点之一。
In 1625, the Manchu leader Nurhaci captured Shenyang and decided to relocate his entire administrative infrastructures to the city, or Simiyan hoton (Manchu: ᠰᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠨ	1625 年，满族首领努尔哈赤占领沈阳，决定将其全部行政基础设施迁至这座城市，也叫 Simiyan hoton（满语：ᠰᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠨ
ᡥᠣᡨᠣᠨ) as it is called in Manchu language.	ᡥᠣᡨᠣᠨ）按照其满语发音。
The official name was changed to Shengjing (盛京; Shèng Jīng; 'rising capital'), or Mukden (Manchu: ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠨ), in 1634.	1634 年，官方名称改为“盛京”（“崛起的首都”），又叫“穆克敦”（满语：ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠨ）。
The new name derives from the Manchu word, mukdembi (Manchu: ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠮᠪᡳ), meaning "to rise" as reflected also by its Han Chinese name.	新名称来自满语词汇 mukdembi （满语：ᠮᡠᡴ᠋ᡩᡝᠮᠪᡳ），意思是“上升”，这在其汉语名称中也有所体现。
Under Nurhaci's orders, the Imperial Palace was constructed in 1626, symbolizing the city's emerging status as the Jurchen political center.	依照努尔哈赤的命令，沈阳故宫于 1626 年开建，象征该城作为女真政治中心的新兴地位。

However, Shenyang retained considerable importance as the secondary capital and the spiritual home of the Qing dynasty through the centuries.	但沈阳作为清朝的陪都和精神家园，几百年来一直保持相当重要的地位。
Treasures of the royal house were kept at its palaces, and the tombs of the early Qing rulers were once among the most famous monuments in China.	皇室珍宝保存在宫殿中，前清统治者的陵墓曾是中国最著名的古迹之一。
In 1657, Fengtian Prefecture (奉天府; Fèngtiān Fŭ; Manchu: ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ	1657 年，奉天府（满语：ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ

After the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan coerced the annexation of the Liaodong Peninsula with the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, though was forced to give it up due to diplomatic pressure from the Triple Intervention.	甲午战争后，日本于 1895 年以《马关条约》胁迫吞并辽东半岛，但迫于三国干涉的外交压力而放弃。
In the aftermath of the Japanese threat, Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang visited Moscow in 1896 and signed a secret treaty with Russian foreign minister Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, allowing Imperial Russia to build a Russian gauge railway in Manchuria, which opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of another lease convention in 1898, effectively allowing Russia to annex Port Arthur in all but name.	在被日本人威胁之后，清朝总督李鸿章于 1896 年出访莫斯科，与俄国外交大臣罗拔诺甫签订了一项秘密条约，允许沙皇俄国在满洲修建一条俄制轨距的铁路，这为俄国在 1898 年以另一项租约的形式进一步扩张打开了大门，实际上允许俄国在事实上吞并旅顺口。
However, after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Russian forces used the anti-foreigner insurgency as a pretext to formally invade and occupied most of Manchuria, and Mukden became a Russian stronghold in the Far East with the building of the South Manchurian Railway.	但在 1900 年义和团运动之后，俄国军队以反外国人叛乱为借口，正式入侵并占领了满洲的大部分地区，随着南满铁路的修建，穆克敦成为俄国在远东地区的一个据点。
During the Russo-Japanese War (1904—1905), Mukden was the site of the Battle of Mukden from February 19 to March 10, 1905. Involving more than 600,000 combat participants, it was the largest battle since the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, and also the largest modern-era battle ever fought in Asia before World War II.	日俄战争期间（1904-1905 年），穆克敦是 1905 年 2 月 19 日至 3 月 10 日奉天会战所在地。有 60 多万人参战，是自 1813 年莱比锡战役以来规模最大的一次战役，也是二战前亚洲打过的最大的一次现代战争。
Following the Japanese victory, Mukden became one of the chief bases of Japanese presence and economic expansion into southern Manchuria.	日本胜利后，奉天成为日本在南满洲驻扎及经济扩张的主要根据地之一。
It also became the government seat of Fengtian province in 1910.	在 1910 年，也成为奉天省的政府所在地。
In 1914, the city changed back to its old name Shenyang, but continued to be known as Mukden (sometimes spelled Moukden) in some English sources and in Japan through much of the first half of 20th century.	1914 年，该市改回其旧名沈阳，但在 20 世纪上半叶的大部分时间里，一些英文资料和日本国内继续称之为奉天（有时拼为Moukden）。
The postmark of the Chinese postal administration kept the spelling "MOUKDEN/奉天" for usage on international mails until the late 1920s.	中国邮政管理局在国际邮件的邮戳上一直保留“MOUKDEN/奉天”的写法，直至 20 世纪 20 年代末。
After that, a Chinese–Manchurian bilingual type "SHENYANG (MUKDEN)/瀋陽 (奉天)" datestamp was used until 1933.	此后，“SHENYANG（MUKDEN）/沈阳（奉天）”的满汉双语日期戳一直使用至 1933 年。
In the early 20th century, Shenyang began expanding out of its old city walls.	20 世纪初，沈阳开始向老城墙外扩张。
The Shenyang Railway Station on the South Manchurian Railway and the Shenyang North Railway Station on the Jingfeng Railway, both west of the old city, became the new commercial centers of Shenyang.	南满铁路沈阳火车站和京奉铁路沈阳北站均位于老城西边，成为沈阳新的商业中心。
In the 1920s, Mukden was the capital of the warlord Zhang Zuolin, who was later assassinated when his train was blown up on 4 June 1928 at a Japanese-guarded railway bridge.	20 世纪 20 年代，奉天是军阀张作霖的首府，1928 年 6 月 4 日，张作霖乘坐的火车在一座由日本人守卫的铁路桥上爆炸，遭暗杀身亡。
At the time, several factories were built by Zhang to manufacture ammunition in the northern and eastern suburbs.	当时，张作霖在北郊和东郊建了多家工厂，生产弹药。
These factories laid the foundation for Shenyang's industrial development.	这些工厂为沈阳的工业发展奠定了基础。
At around 10:20 pm on 18 September 1931, a small quantity of dynamite was detonated close to a railway line near Mukden owned by the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company by Kwantung Army Lt.	1931 年 9 月 18 日晚 10:20 左右，少量炸药在日本南满铁路公司拥有的奉天附近的一段铁路线旁被引爆，肇事者为关东军中尉
Kawamoto Suemori.	河本末守。
The Imperial Japanese Army, accusing Chinese dissidents of the act, then use the false flag explosion as pretext to launch a full attack on Mukden, and captured the city the following morning (September 19).	日本帝国陆军谴责中国持不同政见者做出此举，随后以假国旗爆炸为借口，对奉天发动全面进攻，并于次日上午（9 月 19 日）占领该城。
After the Mukden Incident, the Japanese further invaded and occupied the rest of Northeast China, and created the puppet state of Manchukuo with the deposed emperor Aisin Gioro Puyi as the figurehead.	“九·一八”事变后，日本进一步入侵并占领了中国东北其他地区，并建立了伪满洲国，以逊帝爱新觉罗·溥仪作为傀儡。
During the Manchukuo era (1932–1945), the city was again called Fengtian (and Mukden in English), and was developed by the Japanese into a center of heavy industry.	在伪满时期（1932-1945 年），这座城市再次被称为奉天（英语Mukden），日本人将其发展成一个重工业中心。
Japan was able to exploit resources in Manchuria using the extensive network of railroads.	日本可以利用四通八达的铁路网络，开发满洲资源。
For example, vast expanses of Manchurian forest were chopped down.	例如，大片的满洲森林遭到砍伐。
The development of Shenyang was also unbalanced in this period; municipal facilities were mostly located in Japanese residential areas, while Chinese residential areas had poor living conditions.	沈阳在这一时期的发展也不平衡，市政设施大多位于日本人居住区，而中国人居住区的生活条件较差。
Under Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky, the Far East Command of Soviet forces entered Manchuria in early August 1945 following the surrender of Japan.	日本投降后，在苏联元帅亚历山大·华西列夫斯基的指挥下，苏联军队远东司令部于 1945 年 8 月初进入满洲。
On 16 August 1945, Manchurian Emperor Puyi was captured in Shenyang Airport by the Soviet Red Army while he was in an airplane fleeing to Japan.	1945 年 8 月 16 日，伪满皇帝溥仪在沈阳机场被苏联红军抓获，当时他正在逃往日本的飞机上。
On 20 August, Soviet troops captured Shenyang.	8 月 20 日，苏军占领沈阳。
British and US reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Northeast China and Eastern Inner Mongolia region looted and terrorized the people of Shenyang, and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage".	英国和美国的报道表明，苏联军队占领了中国东北和内蒙古东部地区，对沈阳百姓进行劫掠和恐吓，并且不顾苏联当局劝阻，进行了“为期三天的强奸和抢劫”。
The Soviets were replaced by the Nationalist Chinese, who were flown in on U.S. transport planes.	苏联人被乘坐美国运输机涌入的中国国民党所取代。
During the Chinese Civil War, Shenyang remained a Kuomintang stronghold from 1946 to 1948, although the Chinese communists controlled the surrounding countryside.	国共内战期间，从 1946 年到 1948 年，沈阳一直是国民党根据地，但中国共产党控制了周围的农村地区。
It was captured by the communists on October 30, 1948, following a series of offensives known as the Liaoshen Campaign.	经过辽沈战役的一系列进攻，1948 年 10 月 30 日，共产党攻占该城。
Over the past 200 years or so, Shenyang managed to grow and increase its industrial might, despite consecutive wars with Russia and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second World War, and China's Civil War (Shenyang became the main battleground between the Communists and Nationalists).	在过去 200 年左右的时间里，尽管经历了 19 世纪末 20 世纪初与日本和俄国接连开战、第二次世界大战、国共内战（沈阳是共产党和国民党之间的主战场），沈阳还是发展壮大了自己的工业实力。
The old city of Shenyang resided almost entirely within the modern day Shenhe District, and used to have two city walls.	沈阳古城几乎完全位于现在的沈河区内，曾有两堵城墙。
Situated roughly within the area bounded by the four "Shuncheng" (顺城; 'along the city walls') roads/streets in Shenhe District, the (now-demolished) square-shaped inner city wall marked the bounds of ancient Shenyang.	四方形的内城墙（现已拆除）大致位于沈河区以四条“顺城”路/街为界的区域内，标明了古沈阳的地界。
The earliest wall was built in 926 during early Liao dynasty to settle Northern Song civilians the Khitans abducted from raids to use as slave labourers, and was then made of rammed earth because the city was merely a small settlement at the time (historically the administrative center of the Liaodong region was at Liaoyang).	最早的城墙建于辽代初期 926 年，用于安置在突袭中被契丹人掳走当作奴隶劳工的北宋平民，由于当时的城市只是一个小定居点（历史上辽东地区的行政中心位于辽阳），当时采用夯土建造。
However, in 1368, Hongwu Emperor of the newly founded Ming dynasty ordered a new regional military command—the Liaodong Regional Military Commission (遼東都指揮使司)—to be established, and Shenyang was made a prominent regional "guard town" (衛所).	但在 1368 年，新建立的明朝的洪武皇帝下令建立一个新的地区军事指挥部——辽东都指挥使司，沈阳成为了著名的地区“卫所”。
In 1388, Min Zhong (閔忠), the newly appointed city commissioner of the Shenyang Central Guard, wrote to Hongwu Emperor immediately upon his tenure requesting permission to upgrade the city wall, and the old wall was made taller and thoroughly reinforced with overlaid bricks.	1388 年，新任沈阳中卫城指挥使闵忠刚一上任就致信洪武皇帝，请求批准升级城墙，对旧城墙进行加高，并用覆土砖彻底加固。
According to History of Ming, the reconstructed Ming-era wall was 2.5 zhàngs (8 metres or 26 feet) tall, more than 1 zhàng (3.2 metres or 10.5 feet) wide at the top, and 9 lis and 30 bus (about 5.2 kilometres or 3.2 miles) long.	据《明史》记载，重建的明城墙高 2.5 丈（8 米或 26 英尺），顶宽超过 1 丈（3.2 米或 10.5 英尺），长 9 里 30 步（约 5.2 公里或 3.2 英里）。
It has two layers of moats dug outside, each being 3 zhàngs (9.6 metres or 31.5 feet) wide and 8 chis (2.56 metres or 8 feet 4.8 inches) deep, fed with water from Shen River.	墙外挖了两道护城河，各 3 丈（9.6 米或 31.5 英尺）宽，深 8 尺（2.56 米或 8 英尺 4.8 英寸），水源来自沈河。
There were four city gates, each at the center of one side, connected by two main roads that intersected at Central Temple of the city's center in a "+" fashion.	有四扇城门，各位于每侧城墙正中，由两条主路相连，在城中心的中央庙十字相交。
This Ming wall was heavily damaged in 1625 after the Manchu laid siege and captured the city, with only the north wall and gate (which had undergone reinforcing reconstructions in 1545 under the orders of Jiajing Emperor) remained intact.	1625 年，满族围攻占领该城后，明城墙遭到严重破坏，只有北面的城墙和城门（1545 年嘉靖皇帝下令加固重建）完好无损。
The Manchu leader Nurhachi however saw the strategic value of the city, and decided to formally relocate his Later Jin capital from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and ordered the city wall to be rebuilt.	但满族领袖努尔哈赤看到了这座城市的战略价值，决定正式将他的后金都城从辽阳迁至沈阳，并下令重修城墙。
According to Annals of Mukden (盛京通志), the new city wall was a standard black brick wall standing at a height of 3.5 zhàngs (about 12.5 metres or 41.0 feet), a width of 1.8 zhàngs (about 6.4 metres or 21.0 feet) and a total length of 9 lis and 332 bus (about 6.4 kilometres or 4.0 miles) long, complete with 12 towers (8 gate and 4 corner) and a 14.5 zhàngs (about 52-metre or 171-foot) wide moat.	据《盛京通志》记载，新城墙为标准青砖墙，高 3.5 丈（约 12.5 米或 41.0 英尺），宽 1.8 丈（约 6.4 米或 21.0 英尺），总长度 9 里 332 步（约 6.4 公里或 4.0 英里），有 12 座塔楼（8 门 4 角）和一条宽 14.5 丈（约 52 米或 171 英尺）的护城河。
The city gates were increased from four to eight, though the old Ming-era north gate and tower was preserved but sealed shut, later known as the "Ninth Gate" (九門).	城门从四个增加到八个，虽然旧的明代北门和塔楼得以保留，但被封死，后来被称为“九门”。
The outer city wall, called the "peripheral wall" (邊牆; Biān Qiáng) or "pass wall" (關牆; Guān Qiáng), was actually a rammed earth rampart built in 1680 to expand the urban area outside the inner city.	外城墙称为“边墙”或“关墙”，实际上是建于 1680 年的一道夯土墙，向内城之外扩大城市区域。
It was almost round in shape, standing at a height of 7.5 chis (around 2.7 metres or 8 feet 10.3 inches) and an overall length of 32 lis and 24 bus (about 20.7 kilometres or 12.9 miles), and also had eight gates known as the "peripheral gates" (邊門; Biān Mén).	几乎为圆形，高 7.5 尺（约 2.7 米或 8 英尺 10.3 英寸），总长 32 里 24 步（约 20.7 公里或 12.9 英里），也有八个门，称为“边门”。
The corresponding inner and outer gates were linked by roads that intersected within the inner city in a "#" pattern around the Mukden Palace.	对应的内外城门以道路相连，这些路在沈阳故宫周围相交成“井”字形。
Nearly all of these city walls and gates were demolished after 1949.	几乎所有这些城墙和城门都在 1949 年后被拆除。
Two gates and one corner tower of the inner wall were rebuilt during the 1990s.	20 世纪 90 年代，重建了内城的两个城门和一座角楼。
There had, however, been proposals to rebuild the other gates and towers in preparation to the 12th National Games in 2013.	但是，曾有人提议重建其他城门和城楼，以迎接 2013 年的第十二届全运会。
Around 2.5 km (1.6 mi) outside Shenyang's former outer wall, there were four pagodas each located within an associated Tibetan buddhist temple, namely the East Pagoda in Yongguang Temple (永光寺), the South Pagoda in Guangci Temple (廣慈寺), the West Pagoda in Yanshou Temple (延壽寺) and the North Pagoda in Falun Temple (法輪寺).	沈阳原外城墙外约 2.5 公里（1.6 英里）处，有四座宝塔，每座塔都坐落在相关的藏传佛教寺庙内，即永光寺东塔、广慈寺南塔、延寿寺西塔和法轮寺北塔。
They were built in 1643 and completed in 1645.	这些塔于 1643 年开建，1645 年建成。
The four pagodas are identical white Buddha-stupas as tall as 26 m (85 ft).	这四座宝塔为一模一样的白色佛塔，高 26 米（85 英尺）。
Nowadays only the temple for the North Pagoda is well preserved, the East and South has only the pagodas left, and the temple for the West Pagoda was rebuilt in 1998.	现在只有北塔的寺庙保存完好，东塔和南塔只剩塔体，西塔寺庙于 1998 年重建。
Both the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth were also to be found in the old city during the Qing dynasty.	清代时也曾在古城中发现天坛和地坛。
They were smaller replicas of Beijing's counterparts.	是北京天坛和地坛的小型复制品。
Neither exists today.	如今都不复存在。

The central urban area is surrounded by three artificial rivers—respectively the South Canal (南运河) from the south and southeast, the Xinkai River (新开河, formerly the North Canal) from the north and northeast, and the Weigong River (卫工河, formerly the Weigong Nullah) from the west, all interconnected by channels as a continuous waterway.	中央城区被三条人工河包围——分别是南面到东南面的南运河，北面到东北面的新开河，以及西面的卫工河，均通过水渠互相连接，成为一条连续的水道。
The South Canal in particular, famous for the series of linear parks and gardens along it, was constructed upon the old course of the Wanquan River (萬泉河; 'ten thousand springs river'), historically also called the Little Shen River (小瀋水) or Wuli River (五里河; 'five-li river'), which was a principal water source for the old city.  These are reinforced on the peripheries by smaller rivers such as Xi River (细河), Puhe River (蒲河) and Mantang River (满堂河), and drains into the Hun River at three different locations on the southeast, due south and southwest side of the city.	特别是南运河，以沿岸的长条形公园和花园而闻名，是在万泉河的旧道上修建的，这条河在历史上也称为小沈水或五里河，是古城的主要水源。细河、蒲河和满堂河等较小的河流在外围流入这些河，在城市的东南方、正南方和西南方三个不同地点汇入浑河。
There was also previously another canal on the east side called Huishan Nullah (辉山明渠) that drains into Xinkai River's lower section, but is now no longer existent due to land reclamation from urban constructions.	以前东边还有另一条运河，叫辉山明渠，汇入新开河下游，但由于城市建设填土，现已不存在。
