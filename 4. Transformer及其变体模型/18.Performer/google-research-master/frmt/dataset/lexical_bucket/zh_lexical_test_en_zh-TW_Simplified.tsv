The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on 17 December 1997.	「网路日志」(weblog) 一词是由 Jorn Barger 于 1997 年 12 月 17 日创造出来。
The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.	简短版的「网志 (blog，或译为部落格)」则是由 Peter Merholz 创造出来。他在 1999 年的 4 月或 5 月在其部落格「Peterme.com」的侧边拦将「weblog」拆解成「we」和「blog」，想开个小玩笑。
Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.	没过多久，Pyra Labs 公司的 Evan Williams 将「blog」用来当作名词和动词 (「to blog」意即「编辑或张贴某人的网志内容」)，并且想出了「blogger」(部落客) 一词来和 Pyra Labs 的部落客产品相连结，引领这些词汇风行全球。
Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists, and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).	在经营部落格成为显学之间就已经有出现了许多不同形式的数位社群，包括 Usenet、专营线上商业服务的的 GEnie、位元资讯交换 (BIX)，以及早年的 CompuServe、电子邮件清单和电子布告栏系统 (BBS)。
In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running conversations with "threads".	到了 1990 年代，网路论坛软体以「讨论串」建立了持续谈论的对话形式。
Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard".	讨论串为在虚拟「留言板」上依个别主题相互连结成串的讯息。
From 14 June 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What’s New" list of new websites, updated daily and archived monthly.	马赛克通讯公司 (Mosaic Communications Corporation) 从 1993 年 6 月 14 日开始维护其「What’s New」新建网站清单，定期每日更新且每月建档封存。
The page was accessible by a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web browser.	该清单页面可以透过按下 Mosaic 网路浏览器中的「What's New」按钮前往。
The earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web site created in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured a blog in a section called "Online Diary".	最早期的商业部落格实例出现在 Ty, Inc. 公司于 1995 年首度建立的企业对消费者 (B2C) 商务网站上，主打名为「线上日志」的部落格专区。
The entries were maintained by featured Beanie Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.	网站访客会在每月票选出特级豆豆娃娃 (Beanie Babies)，负责维护部落格项目。
The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives.	现代的部落格是由线上日志演变而来。当时的人们会在日志中记录个人生活中各种大小事的流水帐。
Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers.	这些作者大多称呼自己为日记作者、日志作家或日志写手。
Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle.	Justin Hall 从 1994 年开始写作个人部落格，当时他还在就读斯沃斯莫尔学院。他和 Jerry Pournelle 都是公认的元老级部落客。
Dave Winer's Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs.	Dave Winer 的《编撰新闻》(Scripting News) 也被誉为网志界的长青树。
The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net News on their web site from 1996.	澳洲的《网路指南》(Netguide) 杂志从 1996 年开始维护自家网站上的《网路日报》(Daily Net News)。
Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites, mostly in Australia.	《网路日报》负责运作新网站的连结与提供每日评论，其中大多数为澳洲网站。
Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994.	《穿戴式无线网路摄影机》(Wearable Wireless Webcam) 是另一个元老级部落格。这是于 1994 年创立的线上共享日志，可透过穿戴式电脑和 EyeTap 智慧眼镜装置将数位影片和数位照片即时传送到网站，并结合文字分享个人生活。
This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters.	这种结合了实拍影片和文字的半自动部落格实作在当时被称为「逆向监视」(sousveillance)，而且像这样的日志内容也会用来在法律诉讼中做为证据。
Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.	在人们普遍使用「部落格」一词之前，其实有些早期的部落客 (比如从 1997 年开始经营《厌世妖姬》(The Misanthropic Bitch) 的部落客) 会称呼自己的线上写作内容为「小志」(zine)。
Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites.	早期的部落格就只是在一般网站上使用手动更新的元件。
In 1995, the "Online Diary" on the Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available.	1995 年，当时还没有任何部落格程式，Ty, Inc. 公司网站上的「线上日志」是采手动方式产出与更新内容。
Posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text based HTML code using FTP software in real time several times a day.	一天要使用好几次 FTP 软体来手动即时更新 HTML 文字编码，让贴文以反向时序呈现。
To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day.	对使用者来说，这样会让日记看起来犹如生活实况，每天都会新增多篇文章。
At the beginning of each new day, new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file, and the start of each month, diary entries were archived into its own folder which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month.	每一天的第一件事就是手动将新的日记文章编码汇入新的 HTML 档案，然后在每个月的一开始将日记文章封存到专属资料夹内。资料夹中收藏了该月份每一天的个别 HTML 页面。
Then menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site.	接着会手动更新网站上所有内含最近日记文章连结的选单。
This text-based method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later.	这种运用文字编码来整理上千个档案的方式，成为往后部落格样式的定义基础，并为数年之后研发出来的部落格软体所用。
The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger and less technically-inclined population.	电子和软体工具与时俱进，有助于产出与维护以反向时序张贴的网页文章，让更多对于相关技术并不熟悉的民众得以顺利透过程序发表文章。
Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today.	最后，我们如今所熟悉且特有的线上部落格发表型态，于焉诞生。
For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging".	例如，使用某些浏览器软体来「写部落格」，现在已蔚为典型。
Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, on regular web hosting services, or run using blog software.	部落格可以交托给专门的定期网路托管服务，或是使用部落格软体来经营。
An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.	部落格越来越受到重视，并于 2002 年迎来早期的里程碑，当时有许多部落客都在关注美国参议院多数党领袖 Trent Lott 的发言。
Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president.	Lott 参议员为拥护美国参议员 Strom Thurmond 的派系成员，他盛赞 Thurmond 参议员为能让美国更加茁壮强大的总统人选。
Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign.	Lott 的批评者则将这些言论视为他默许 Thurmond 于 1948 年竞选总统时主张的种族隔离政策。
This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers.	这项观点在部落客挖掘出来的文件和访谈影片中得到进一步证实。
(See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.)	(请参阅 Josh Marshall 的《论点备忘录》(Talking Points Memo) 部落格。)
Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.	虽然 Lott 是在有媒体在场的公开场合发言，主流媒体却对他的争议性言论只字未提，直到有部落格爆料这件事。
Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.	在部落格推波助澜之下，这场政治危机迫使 Lott 卸下多数党领袖一职。
Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the "Rathergate" scandal.	同样，部落格也是让「拉瑟门」(Rathergate) 丑闻摊上台面的一大功臣。
To wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show 60 Minutes) that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's military service record.	事情是这样的：(电视新闻主播) 丹拉瑟 (在 CBS 电视台的《60 分钟》节目上) 公开了几份文件，其内容与先前众所周知的布希总统服役纪录有所矛盾。
Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view.	有些部落客宣称这些文件均属伪造，并提出证据和论述来支持自身看法。
Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see Little Green Footballs).	结果，CBS 电视台为其报导技巧欠缺专业素养公开致歉 (请参阅《小巧绿足球》(Little Green Footballs) 部落格)。
Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.	有许多部落客将这件丑闻视为大众媒体接受部落格的起始点。媒体会将部落格当成新闻来源、意见表述以及施加政治压力的方法。
The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination.	在这些事件的影响之下，部落格成为更具可信度的新闻传播媒介。
Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead.	虽然部落客经常会被当成受党派操弄的舆论工具，有时候却能在主流媒体不得不遵从上级指示时，抢先让关键资讯曝光。
More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.	不过，新建立的部落格反而更常会对主流媒体已经发布的新闻来做出回应。
Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis.	与此同时，有越来越多各界专家开设部落格，让部落格成为深度分析的资料来源。
In Russia, some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official, overwhelmingly pro-government media.	在俄国，有些政论部落客开始挑战影响力铺天盖地的官媒和亲政府媒体。
Bloggers such as Rustem Adagamov and Alexei Navalny have many followers and the latter's nickname for the ruling United Russia party as the "party of crooks and thieves" has been adopted by anti-regime protesters.	Rustem Adagamov 和 Alexei Navalny 都是有许多人追踪的部落客，后者还把执政的统一俄罗斯党称为「骗子和小偷党」，反政府的示威团体后来也采用了这个绰号。
This led to the Wall Street Journal calling Navalny "the man Vladimir Putin fears most" in March 2012.	这让《华尔街日报》(Wall Street Journal) 于 2012 年 3 月将 Navalny 冠上「普丁最害怕的男人」的称号。
By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as political consultants, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming.	到了 2004 年，部落格逐渐跻身主流媒体行列，政治顾问、通讯社和候选人纷纷开始使用部落格做为拓展人脉和形塑意见的工具。
Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source.	政治人物和候选人会成立部落格来针对战争及其他议题表达意见，巩固了部落格做为新闻来源的角色定位。
(See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK's Labour Party's MP Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents.	(请见 Howard Dean 和 Wesley Clark)。就连平时不常主动举办竞选活动的政治人物 (比如英国劳工党籍国会议员 Tom Watson) 都开始成立部落格，和选民密切联系
In January 2005, Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people "could not ignore": Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.	2005 年 1 月，《财富」杂志列出商业人士「不可忽视」的八名部落客：Peter Rojas、Xeni Jardin、Ben Trott、Mena Trott、Jonathan Schwartz、Jason Goldman、Robert Scoble 和 Jason Calacanis。
Israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog.	以色列是设立政府官方部落格的前几个国家之一。
Under David Saranga, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web 2.0 initiatives, including an official video blog and a political blog.	以色列外交部在 David Saranga 的带领之下积极采用 Web 2.0 技术开创新局，包括设立官方影音部落格和政治部落格。
The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference.	外交部也透过推特针对与哈马斯组织之间的战争举行微型部落格记者会，由 Saranga 使用简短的文字讯息在全球直播的记者会中回答大众媒体提问。
The questions and answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country's official political blog.	问答内容后来都张贴在国家的官方政治部落格《IsraelPolitik》上面。
The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments.	部落格对于主流媒体的影响，也已经得到政府认可。
In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area.	2009 年，美国有多家报业公司申请破产，新闻产业顿时一片愁云惨雾，结果导致在同一发行区域相互竞争的报纸数量减少。
Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government.	坊间开始有人议论著报业是否能成为联邦政府推出振兴方案的受惠者。
U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying "if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”.	美国总统欧巴马承认部落格的社会影响力越来越大，他说：「如果新闻全都奉部落格为圭臬、所有意见陈述都缺乏严谨的事实查证、断章取义的行为四处可见，那么人们到最后就只会相互叫嚣谩骂，难以充分理解彼此的想法。」
Between 2009 and 2012, an Orwell Prize for blogging was awarded.	在 2009 年至 2012 年间，曾颁发过专属于部落格的奥威尔奖。
Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in participatory journalism, are amateur journalists, and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in mainstream media organizations.	有许多部落客 (尤其是身为参与式新闻一份子的部落客) 是业余的新闻工作者，也因此他们会将自己和在主流媒体组织工作的专业记者及编辑区分开来。
Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online, rather than via a TV station or newspaper, either as an add-on to a traditional media presence (e.g., hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper), or as their sole journalistic output.	其他部落客则是媒体从业人员，会在线上而非电视台或报纸上发表个人想法。他们有人会把部落格当成传统媒体 (如主持广播节目或在报纸上写专栏) 的附加空间，有人会当成唯一的新闻发声管道。
Some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" of media "gatekeepers" and pushing their messages directly to the public.	有些机构和组织会把部落格视为「绕过媒体守门人审查」的方法，能够将它们的讯息直接传递给普罗大众。
Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list.	同时，有许多主流媒体的新闻记者也在写自己的部落格—根据 CyberJournalist.net 网站的新闻部落格清单 (J-blog list) 显示，数量已经远远超过 300 个。
The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.	目前已知第一个出现在新闻网站上的部落格创建于 1998 年 8 月，当时《夏洛特观察报》(The Charlotte Observer) 的 Jonathan Dube 创建了记录邦妮飓风动态的部落格。

The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: Duncan Black (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit), Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos), Alex Steffen (Worldchanging), Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette), Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com), and Ezra Klein (Ezra Klein blog in The American Prospect, now in the Washington Post).	下列部落客 (及其他人) 有在广播电台和电视台上出现：Duncan Black (他的笔名 Atrios 广为人知)、Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit)、Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos)、Alex Steffen (Worldchanging)、Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette)、Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com)，以及 Ezra Klein (原为《美国展望》(The American Prospect) 杂志的 Ezra Klein 部落格，现已移至《华盛顿邮报》(Washington Post))。
In counterpoint, Hugh Hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.	Hugh Hewitt 则反其道而行，成为大众媒体从业人员转换方向的典范。他藉由自已具有影响力的部落客身分来增加「旧媒体」的触及人数。
Similarly, it was Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online blog articles that captured Surgeon General of the United States Richard Carmona's attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host Lisa Tolliver and Westchester Emergency Volunteer Reserves-Medical Reserve Corps Director Marianne Partridge.	同样，当年美国医务总监 Richard Carmona 当年就是注意到了《广播及线上紧急整备与安全提示》(Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online) 部落格上的文章，并大力赞扬由谈话节目主持人 Lisa Tolliver 和西彻斯特郡紧急医疗志愿后备军医疗后备队队长 Marianne Partridge 共同主持的相关广播节目。
Blogs have also had an influence on minority languages, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in Gaelic languages.	部落格也影响了少数语言，让散居各地的母语人士和学习者得以齐聚一堂，其中盖尔语的相关部落格尤具成效。
Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.	少数语言的发表内容 (往往在经济层面无以为继) 可以透过平价的部落格写作方式来找到阅听众。
There are examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti, Jessica Cutler, ScrappleFace.	以下列举几位将自己的部落格文章集结出版的部落客：Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti、Jessica Cutler、ScrappleFace。
Blog-based books have been given the name blook.	将部落格内容集结出版的书籍被称作「部落格书」(blook)。
A prize for the best blog-based book was initiated in 2005, the Lulu Blooker Prize.	专门表扬最佳部落格书的「Lulu 部落格书奖」于 2005 年开始颁发。
However, success has been elusive offline, with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs.	然而，线上的成功却不保证线下也能获得佳绩，这类书籍的销售热度有许多都比不上部落格本身的人气。
The book based on Julie Powell's blog "The Julie/Julia Project" was made into the film Julie & Julia, apparently the first to do so.	将 Julie Powell 的「The Julie/Julia Project」部落格内容集结出版的书籍后来翻拍成电影《美味关系》(Julie & Julia)，首开业界先例。
Consumer-generated advertising is a relatively new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers.	消费者创作广告行销是较为新颖且具有争议的趋势发展，建立了公司企业与消费者之间的崭新行销传播模式。
Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts.	在各式各样的部落格广告行销中，最具争议的莫过于业配文。
These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords.	这些会是以意见回馈、评论、意见表述、影片等形式发表的部落格内容或贴文，而且通常内含使用了一组或多组关键词的业配网站连结。
Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites.	部落格导致了某种程度的去中间化并瓦解了传统的广告行销模式，让公司能够略过广告代理商 (这在之前是接触顾客的唯一窗口)，直接透过社群媒体网站与顾客联系。
On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, to take advantage of this new development as well.	另一方面，专营部落格广告行销的新创公司也纷纷设立，搭上新一波趋势发展的顺风车。
However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development.	然而，有许多人并不看好这样的趋势发展。
Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.	有些人相信部落格上的各种商业行为将会毁坏部落格圈的可信度。
Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences.	书写部落格可能会面临到一连串的法律责任以及其他意料之外的后果。

U.S. payouts related to blogging totaled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance.	2009 年，美国境内与部落格相关的罚锾总额为一千七百四十万美元，其中有一部分是伞护式责任保险的理赔金。
The courts have returned with mixed verdicts.	每个法庭的判决结果都不太一样。
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC).	一般而言，网际网路服务供应商 (ISP) 对于来自第三方的资讯概不担负法律责 (参照《美国通讯端正法》(U.S. Communications Decency Act) 和《欧盟电子商务指令》(EU Directive 2000/31/EC)) 。
In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration.	在 Doe v. Cahill 诉讼案的审理过程中，德拉瓦州立最高法院坚持要在符合严格标准的情形下查出匿名部落客的真实身分，并且罕见地撤销诽谤告诉 (此举无美国诽谤罪相关法律根据) 而非驳回初审法院重新审理。
In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival.	案情接着急转直下，Cahill 团队顺利得知 John Doe 的真实身分，正是他们之前所怀疑的那个人：当地城镇的镇长，为 Cahill 议员的政敌。
The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.	Cahill 团队随后修正了原先的告诉，那位镇长则以和解避免了后续审判。
In January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over an alleged defamation.	2007 年 1 月，两位知名的马来西亚政论部落客，Jeff Ooi 和 Ahirudin Attan，因涉嫌诽谤而遭到亲政府报纸媒体 (《马来西亚新海峡时报》(The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia)) 的 Berhad、Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan、Hishamuddin bin Aun 和 Brenden John a/l John Pereira 等人提告。

In the United States, blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 2005.	2005 年，部落客 Aaron Wall 在美国遭到 Traffic Power 公司提告诽谤以及公开营业秘密。
According to Wired magazine, Traffic Power had been "banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results." Wall and other "white hat" search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public.	据《连线》(Wired) 杂志报导，Traffic Power 曾因为「涉嫌操纵搜寻引擎的搜寻结果而遭 Google 下达禁令」。 Wall 和其他「白帽」搜寻引擎最佳化咨询顾问则以保护普罗大众之名，揭发了 Traffic Power 的恶行恶状。
The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.	这起诉讼案因为缺少属人管辖权而遭到撤销，Traffic Power 也并未在允许的时限内提起上诉。
The word "pineapple" in English was first recorded to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed pine cones).	据文献记载，英文中的「凤梨」(pineapple) 一开始是用来形容针叶树的果实 (如今均改以「松果」(pine cones) 称之)。
When European explorers encountered this tropical fruit in the Americas, they called them "pineapples" (first referenced in 1664, for resemblance to pine cones).	当年，来自欧洲的探险者在美洲遇见了这种热带水果，就称其为「pineapple」(首见于 1664 年的文献，因为觉得这水果形似松果)。
In the scientific binomial Ananas comosus, ananas, the original name of the fruit, comes from the Tupi word nanas, meaning "excellent fruit", as recorded by André Thevet in 1555, and comosus, "tufted", refers to the stem of the fruit.	这种水果的原始学名为 Ananas (凤梨属) 的 Ananas comosus，源自于巴西图皮族语的「nanas」，即「绝佳水果」之意。该族语名称由 André Thevet 于 1555 年记录在相关文献中。学名中的「comosus」 (「丛生」之意) 则是用来指称这种水果的茎部。
Other members of the genus Ananas are often called pine, as well, in other languages.	凤梨属的其他成员在其他语言中也通常会以「松」(pine) 为名。
In the wild, pineapples are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds.	野生的凤梨主要都是透过蜂鸟帮忙授粉。
Certain wild pineapples are foraged and pollinated at night by bats.	有某些品种的野生凤梨则在夜间供蝙蝠觅食并协助授粉。
Under cultivation, because seed development diminishes fruit quality, pollination is performed by hand, and seeds are retained only for breeding.	在种植过程中，因为种子的发育会损害水果品质，所以一律采取人工授粉，种子仅保留为育种用途。
Specifically in Hawaii, where pineapples were cultivated and canned industrially throughout the 20th century, importation of hummingbirds was prohibited.	夏威夷从二十世纪以来已经种植凤梨并建立凤梨罐头工业达百年之久，这里明文规定禁止让蜂鸟入境。
The plant is indigenous to South America and is said to originate from the area between southern Brazil and Paraguay; however, little is known about the origin of the domesticated pineapple (Pickersgill, 1976).	凤梨是在南美洲土生土长的水果，据说其发源地为介于巴西南部和巴拉圭之间的区域。然而，人工种植凤梨的起源却鲜为人知 (Pickersgill, 1976)。
MS Bertoni (1919) considered the Paraná–Paraguay River drainages to be the place of origin of A. comosus.	MS Bertoni (1919) 认为巴拉那—巴拉圭河流域为凤梨的起源地。
The natives of southern Brazil and Paraguay spread the pineapple throughout South America, and it eventually reached the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico, where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs.	巴西和巴拉圭的原住民将凤梨传播到南美洲各地，最终抵达了加勒比海地区、中美洲和墨西哥，让马雅人和阿兹特克人种植养育。
Columbus encountered the pineapple in 1493 on the leeward island of Guadeloupe.	哥伦布于 1493 年在瓜地洛普的背风群岛遇见了凤梨。
He called it piña de Indes, meaning "pine of the Indians", and brought it back with him to Spain, thus making the pineapple the first bromeliad to be introduced by humans outside of the New World.	他称之为「piña de Indes」(即「印地安松果」之意)，并将它带回去西班牙，凤梨就此成为在新大陆之外的人们首次认识到的凤梨科植物。
The Spanish introduced it into the Philippines, Hawaii (introduced in the 18th century, first commercial plantation 1886), Zimbabwe, and Guam.	西班牙人随后将凤梨引进菲律宾、夏威夷 (于十八世纪引进，并于 1886 年首度进行商业种植)、辛巴威和关岛。
The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and introduced it into India by 1550.	葡萄牙人从巴西取得了这款水果，并于 1550 年引进印度。
The pineapple was brought to northern Europe by the Dutch from their colony in Surinam.	荷兰人则从他们位于苏利南的殖民地将凤梨带到欧洲北部。
The first pineapple to be successfully cultivated in Europe, is said to have been grown by Pieter de la Court at Meerburg in 1658.	据说在欧洲成功种出来的第一颗凤梨是由 Pieter de la Court 于 1658 年在密尔堡 (Meerburg) 种植养育完成。
In England, the first pineapple was grown at Dorney Court, Dorney in Buckinghamshire, and a huge "pineapple stove" needed to grow the plants had been built at the Chelsea Physic Garden in 1723.	在英国，凤梨首次栽种于白金汉郡多尼村的多尼庄园 (Dorney Court)，之后则于 1723 年在切尔西药草园 (Chelsea Physic Garden) 建造了一座巨大的凤梨温室。
In France, King Louis XV was presented with a pineapple that had been grown at Versailles in 1733. Catherine the Great ate pineapples grown on her own estates before her death in 1796.	在法国，有人于 1733 年进贡了在凡尔赛地区种植的凤梨给法国国王路易十五。俄国女皇凯萨琳二世则在 1796 年逝世之前吃过种植在自家皇宫内的凤梨。
Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate, using hothouses called "pineries", pineapples soon became a symbol of wealth.	因为直接进口凤梨的费用高昂，再加上于温带气候种植凤梨需要耗资巨额购买设备、聘请劳工与建造名为「凤梨园」的温室设施，凤梨很快就成为了财富象征。
They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot.	凤梨一开始主要是用来当作晚宴聚会上的展示品，并非拿来食用，而且会重复使用到凤梨开始腐烂为止。
By the second half of the 18th century, the production of the fruit on British estates had become the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats.	到了十八世纪下半叶，在英国庄园内种植凤梨成为了豪绅贵族之间相互较劲的主要项目。
John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore built a hothouse on his estate surmounted by a huge stone cupola 14 metres tall in the shape of the fruit; it is known as the Dunmore Pineapple.	John Murray，世袭第四代邓莫尔伯爵，曾在自家庄园建造了一座温室，并在温室上方盖了一座高达 14 公尺的巨大石造圆顶，且以凤梨为型，故有「邓莫尔凤梨」之称。
John Kidwell is credited with the introduction of the pineapple industry to Hawaii; large-scale pineapple cultivation by US companies began in the early 1900s.	John Kidwell 为让夏威夷开始出现凤梨产业的主要人物。由美国公司主导的大规模凤梨栽种则于 1900 年代早期开始进行。
Among the most famous and influential pineapple industrialists was James Dole, who moved to Hawaii in 1899 and started a pineapple plantation in 1900.	James Dole 为当时最有名气且最具影响力的凤梨大亨之一，他于 1899 年迁居夏威夷，并于 1900 年开始栽种凤梨。
The companies Dole and Del Monte began growing pineapples on the island of Oahu in 1901 and 1917, respectively.	Dole 和德尔蒙公司 (Del Monte) 的公司分别于 1901 年和 1917 年开始在欧胡岛上种植凤梨。
Dole's pineapple company began with the acquisition of 60 acres (24 ha) of land in 1901, and grew into a major company, the Dole Food Company.	Dole 的凤梨公司一开始先在 1901 年取得了 60 英亩 (24 公顷) 的土地，然后逐渐成为一间大公司，也就是后来的都乐食品公司 (Dole Food Company)。
Maui Pineapple Company began pineapple cultivation on the island of Maui in 1909.	茂宜凤梨公司 (Maui Pineapple Company) 于 1909 年开始在茂宜岛上种植凤梨。
In the US, in 1986, the Pineapple Research Institute was dissolved and its assets divided between Del Monte and Maui Land and Pineapple.	在美国，凤梨研究所 (Pineapple Research Institute) 于 1986 年正式解编，其资产则分给了德尔蒙公司和茂宜土地和凤梨公司 (Maui Land and Pineapple)。
Del Monte took cultivar '73–114', dubbed 'MD-2', to its plantations in Costa Rica, found it to be well-suited to growing there, and launched it publicly in 1996 as 'Gold Extra Sweet', while Del Monte also began marketing '73–50', dubbed 'CO-2', as 'Del Monte Gold'.	德尔蒙公司将别称「MD-2」的「73–114」号凤梨品种栽种于哥斯大黎加，发现这款品种相当适合当地的生长环境，并于 1996 年以「极甜金凤梨」为名公开贩售。德尔蒙公司同时也开始以「德尔蒙金凤梨」为名行销另一款别称「CO-2」的「73-50」号凤梨品种。
Dole ceased its cannery operations in Honolulu in 1991, and in 2008, Del Monte terminated its pineapple-growing operations in Hawaii.	都乐公司设立于檀香山的罐头工厂于 1991 年停止运作，德尔蒙公司则于 2008 年终止在夏威夷的凤梨栽种事业。
In 2009, the Maui Pineapple Company reduced its operations to supply pineapples only locally on Maui, and by 2013, only the Dole Plantation on Oahu grew pineapples in a volume of about 0.1 percent of the world's production.	2009 年，茂宜凤梨公司将营运规模缩减为专营茂宜本岛的凤梨供销业务。到了 2013 年，只剩下都乐公司的凤梨园还在欧胡岛上营运，产量约莫为全球总产量的千分之一。
The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were also traditionally widely cultivated in the Philippines for the textile industry from at least the 17th century.	名为「红色西班牙」的凤梨品种最晚从十七世纪开始于菲律宾境内广泛栽种，供纺织工业使用。
They were originally brought to the islands from Latin America during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines.	这款凤梨最先是在西班牙殖民期间从拉丁美洲引进菲律宾。
Smooth Cayenne' was later introduced in the early 1900s by the Bureau of Agriculture during the American colonial period.	之后在 1900 年代早期的美国殖民期间，农业部引进了「开英种」凤梨。
Dole and Del Monte also established plantations in the island of Mindanao in the 1920s; in the provinces of Cotabato and Bukidnon, respectively.	都乐公司和德尔蒙公司也于 1920 年代在民答那峨岛上建立了凤梨园，分别位于哥打巴托省 (Cotabato) 和布基农省 (Bukidnon)。
The Philippines remain one of the top exporters of pineapples in the world.	菲律宾至今仍然是全球数一数二的凤梨出口国。
The Del Monte plantations are now locally managed, after Del Monte Pacific Ltd., a Filipino company, completed the purchase of Del Monte Foods in 2014.	德尔蒙公司的凤梨园现由菲律宾本地的德尔蒙太平洋股份有限公司 (Del Monte Pacific Ltd.) 负责管理。该公司于 2014 年完成并购德尔蒙食品公司。
The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were once extensively cultivated in the Philippines.	「红色西班牙」凤梨曾经一度遍植于菲律宾境内各地。
The long leaves of the cultivar were the source of traditional piña fibers, an adaptation of the native weaving traditions with fibers extracted from abacá.	该品种的长条凤梨叶为传统凤梨纤维织料的来源，用来取代传统原住民使用的马尼拉麻蕉纤维织料。
These were woven into lustrous lace-like nipis fabrics usually decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado.	这些织料会编织成有着蕾丝般光泽的轻薄布料，通常会绣上名为「卡拉朵」(calado) 和「索布拉朵」(sombrados) 的精细花朵图样。
The fabric was a luxury export from the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period and gained favor among European aristocracy in the 18th and 19th centuries.	在西班牙殖民期间。这种布料为自菲律宾出口的奢侈品，并于 18 和 19 世纪广受欧洲贵族喜爱。
Domestically, they were used to make the traditional barong Tagalog, baro't saya, and traje de mestiza clothing of the Filipino upper class, as well as women's kerchiefs (pañuelo).	在菲律宾境内，这些布料会用来为菲律宾的上流阶级制作巴隆他加禄 (Barong Tagalog)、巴罗特沙耶 (baro't saya) 和特拉耶德梅蒂莎 (traje de mestiza) 等传统服饰，以及女性的头巾 (pañuelo)。
They were favored for their light and breezy quality, which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands.	其轻盈且透气的质地十分适合岛上的热带气候，受到众人喜爱。 ]
The industry was destroyed in the Second World War and is only starting to be revived.	该纺织产业在二战期间遭毁，只能努力恢复往日荣景。
In 2017, world production of pineapples was 27.4 million tons, led by Costa Rica, the Philippines, Brazil, and Thailand as the largest producers.	2017 年，全球的凤梨总产量达二千七百四十万吨，主要出口国为哥斯大黎加、菲律宾、巴西和泰国。
In commercial farming, flowering can be induced artificially, and the early harvesting of the main fruit can encourage the development of a second crop of smaller fruits.	在商业农作方面，目前可以透过人工方式诱发凤梨开花。主要水果作物若可提前采收，就能够鼓励栽种较小的水果当作二期作物。
Once removed during cleaning, the top of the pineapple can be planted in soil and a new plant will grow.	凤梨头在清洗过程中切除后，即可种到土里长出新作物。
Three-quarters of the pineapples sold in Europe are grown in Costa Rica, where pineapple production is highly industrialised.	在欧洲销售的凤梨有四分之三栽种于哥斯大黎加，当地的凤梨产业已高度工业化。
Growers typically use 20 kg (44 lb) of pesticides per hectare in each growing cycle, a process that may affect soil quality and biodiversity.	一般而言，在每一期的凤梨耕作期间，每一公顷的田地会用到 20 公斤 (44 磅) 的农药，这过程可能会影响到土壤品质和生态多样性。
The pesticides—organophosphates, organochlorines, and hormone disruptors—have the potential to affect workers' health and can contaminate local drinking water supplies.	这些农药 (内含有机磷和荷尔蒙干扰素) 有可能会影响耕作人员的身体健康，且会污染当地的饮用水源。
Many of these chemicals have potential to be carcinogens, and may be related to birth defects.	其中还有许多可能会致癌以及造成先天缺陷的化学物质。
Because of commercial pressures, many pineapple workers in Costa Rica—60% of whom are Nicaraguan—are paid low wages.	因为公司方有经营压力，许多位于哥斯大黎加的耕作人员 (其中有六成是尼加拉瓜人) 的薪资都只是杯水车薪。
European supermarkets' price-reduction policies have lowered growers' incomes.	欧洲超市的降价政策让耕作者的收入随之减少。
One major pineapple producer contests these claims.	其中有个主要的凤梨生产国质疑这些主帐。
Pineapple fruits and peels contain diverse phytochemicals, among which are polyphenols, including gallic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and arbutin.	凤梨的果肉和果皮均含有丰富多样的植化素，其中有些属于多酚类，包括没食子酸、丁香酸、香兰素、阿魏酸、芥子酸、香豆酸、绿原酸、表儿茶素和熊果素。
Present in all parts of the pineapple plant, bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes.	凤梨全株均含有凤梨酵素，为蛋白水解酵素的混合物。
Bromelain is under preliminary research for a variety of clinical disorders, but to date has not been adequately defined for its effects in the human body.	现在有各式各样的临床症状以凤梨酵素为初步研究项目，但是到目前为止仍没有充分证据确定其对于人体的影响。
Bromelain may be unsafe for some users, such as in pregnancy, allergies, or anticoagulation therapy.	凤梨酵素可能会对孕妇、过敏症患者或是有在服用抗凝血剂的使用者造成危险。
If having sufficient bromelain content, raw pineapple juice may be useful as a meat marinade and tenderizer.	如果生凤梨汁里含有充足的凤梨酵素，不妨拿来腌肉，可以让肉质更加软嫩。
Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as gelatin-based desserts or gel capsules, their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning.	尽管如此，凤梨酵素还是会在调理某些食物或制作凝冻类甜点或凝胶胶囊等加工制品时造成干扰，因为其蛋白分解活性会在烹煮和装罐的过程中导致酵素变质。
The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing.	在一般用量的凤梨果肉中大概不会有太多凤梨酵素，不过在经过特别萃取后，仍可取得足以进行家庭料理和加工处理的酵素量。
Pineapples are subject to a variety of diseases, the most serious of which is wilt disease vectored by mealybugs typically found on the surface of pineapples, but possibly in the closed blossom cups.	凤梨本身容易染上多种疾病，其中最严重的是经粉介壳虫传染的萎凋病。粉介壳虫一般常见于凤梨表皮，但也有可能躲藏在紧闭的花苞中。
Other diseases include citrus pink disease, bacterial heart rot, anthracnose, fungal heart rot, root rot, black rot, butt rot, fruitlet core rot, and yellow spot virus.	其他疾病则包括赤衣病、细菌性心腐病、炭疽病、真菌性心腐病、根腐病、黑腐病、基腐病、小果腐败病和黄斑病毒等。
Pineapple pink disease (not citrus pink disease) is characterized by the fruit developing a brownish to black discoloration when heated during the canning process.	凤梨赤衣病 (非柑橘赤衣病) 的特征为果肉在装罐过程中会因为高温加热而出现由褐转黑的变色现象。
The causal agents of pink disease are the bacteria Acetobacter aceti, Gluconobacter oxydans, Pantoea citrea.	赤衣病的病原为醋酸菌、氧化葡萄糖酸杆菌、柠檬泛菌
and Tatumella ptyseos.	以及痰塔特姆式菌。
Some pests that commonly affect pineapple plants are scales, thrips, mites, mealybugs, ants, and symphylids.	凤梨植株常见的害虫为介壳虫、蓟马、螨虫、粉介壳虫、蚂蚁和结足虫。
Heart-rot is the most serious disease affecting pineapple plants.	心腐病为对凤梨植株影响最重大的疾病。
The disease is caused by Phytophthora cinnamoni and P. parasitica, fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions.	该疾病是由樟疫霉和疫病菌 (P. parasitica) 所导致，通常会在潮湿天候中影响凤梨生长。
Since it is difficult to treat, it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available; all suckers that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide, since the fungus enters through the wounds.	因为该疾病难以治疗，建议在条件允许下透过栽种具有抵抗力的品种来防止染疫，且因为真菌会透过伤口入侵，所以繁殖所需的吸芽均需浸泡在杀菌剂中。
Some buyers prefer green fruit, others ripened or off-green.	有些买家偏爱未熟的青绿水果，有些则偏爱熟透或半熟的水果。
A plant growth regulator, Ethephon, is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest, developing ethylene, which turns the fruit golden yellow.	益收生长素 (Ethephon) 为植物生长调节剂，一般会在采收前一周拿来喷洒在水果上，产生会让水果金黄熟透的乙烯。
After cleaning and slicing, a pineapple is typically canned in sugar syrup with added preservative.	凤梨在清洗和切片过后，一般会和糖浆一同装罐，并加入防腐剂。
A pineapple never becomes any riper than it was when harvested.	凤梨在采收之后就不会再继续熟成。
The fruit itself is quite perishable and if it is stored at room temperature, it should be used within two days; however, if it is refrigerated, the time span extends to 5–7 days.	若储藏在室温中，其果肉本身相当容易腐坏，应于两天内食用完毕。不过，若是放在冰箱冷藏，则储藏时间可以延长至 5 到 7 天。
Mimi Sheller writes: "The pineapple entered European iconography as a symbol of welcome and hospitality, and also eventually found its way into botanical gardens such as the Chelsea Physic Garden, where it was grown in heated pits." The sweet fruit had a "mysterious aura" in the Age of Sail because except for a "small elite with access to glass hothouses", tropical fruits could only be tasted where they were cultivated.	Mimi Sheller 写道：「凤梨刚开始在欧洲的图像学里为热情欢迎和殷勤好客的象征，后来则踏进如切尔西药草园那般的庭园之中，在温室中成长茁壮。」这款滋味甜美的水果大航海时代曾有着「神秘香气」，因为除了「少数得以进入玻璃温室的贵族菁英」之外，就只能在原先种植的地方才能品尝到这类热带水果。
Christopher Cumo writes that "The Spanish who followed Columbus delighted in eating pineapple and in writing about it for a European public eager to learn of the flora and fauna of the Americas ...	Christopher Cumo 写道：「跟随着哥伦布的西班牙人十分喜欢吃凤梨，也一边写着关于凤梨的文章，满足欧洲的普罗大众对于美洲当地动植物的求知欲望…
The pineapple was first a luxury because transit from the tropics to Europe was expensive in the age of sail.	因为在大航海时代，从热带地区运送货物到欧洲的费用高昂，所以凤梨一开始是种奢侈品。
In this respect, pineapple was much like sugar, a commodity of privilege before it became an item of the masses." Cumo writes that "pineapple was the fruit of colonialism" because the Portuguese, French, Dutch, and British all sought to establish pineapple plantations in the tropics of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.	从这方面来看，凤梨就像是糖一般，在成为大众日常用品之前曾是特权阶级才能享有的商品。 」Cumo 接着写道：「凤梨是殖民主义之果」，因为葡萄牙、法国、荷兰和英国等殖民政权都相继设法在位处热带的南美洲、中美洲及加勒比海地区建造凤梨园。
In architecture, pineapple figures are a decorative element symbolizing hospitality.	在建筑学中，凤梨图像为象征热情好客的装饰元素。
Usually in plaster or carved wood, pineapples images occur in finials, pendants,"broken" pediments, and door knockers.	凤梨图像通常会以石膏或木雕等形式当做尖顶装饰、吊饰、镶嵌楣饰和门环装饰。
Pineapples have long been associated with the Hawaiian Islands, to the extent that the pineapple is sometimes used as a symbol of Hawaii, despite the decline of the pineapple industry in that state.	凤梨长年来都会和夏威夷群岛联想在一起，尽管当地的凤梨产业每况愈下，凤梨有时候还是会被用来当成夏威夷的象征。
Foods with pineapple in them are sometimes known as "Hawaiian" for this reason alone.	就是因为如此，加入凤梨的料理有时候也会被称为「夏威夷」料理。
A roller coaster is a type of amusement ride that employs a form of elevated railroad track designed with tight turns, steep slopes, and sometimes inversions.	云霄飞车是一种使用高架轨道的游乐设施，其轨道会有急弯和陡坡等设计，有时候还会出现倒置翻转。
People ride along the track in open cars, and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world.	游客乘坐在轨道上的开放式车厢中，世界各地的游乐园和主题乐园通常都会有这项游乐设施。
LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained one of the first known patents for a roller coaster design in 1885, related to the Switchback Railway that opened a year earlier at Coney Island.	LaMarcus Adna Thompson 于 1885 年获得其中一项目前已知的首批云霄飞车设计专利，与前一年在康尼岛上开放游玩的「折返铁道」(Switchback Railway) 云霄飞车有关。
The track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate.	云霄飞车的轨道设计并非一定是个完整的回圈，好比飞梭式云霄飞车所展示的轨道样貌。
Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained.	大多数的云霄飞车都有多节车厢，游客可坐在里面并受到安全装置保护。
Two or more cars hooked together are called a train.	两节以上接连扣在一起的车厢会称为「列车」。
Some roller coasters, notably Wild Mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.	有些云霄飞车是以单节车厢运转，如著名的「野鼠」(Wild Mouse) 云霄飞车。
The oldest roller coasters are believed to have originated from the so-called "Russian Mountains", specially constructed hills of ice located in the area that is now Saint Petersburg, Russia.	云霄飞车的始祖据信是起源自名为「俄罗斯山」的滑雪设施，特别建造在今日俄国圣彼得堡地区的冰雪山丘上。
Built in the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between 21 and 24 m (70 and 80 feet), had a 50-degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.	该设施建造于十七世纪，高度介于 21 公尺 (约 70 英尺) 至 24 公尺 (约 80英尺) 之间，滑坡的坡度达 50 度，以木造结构稳固支撑。
Later, in 1784, Catherine the Great is said to have constructed a sledding hill in the gardens of her palace at Oranienbaum in St. Petersburg.	据说后来在 1784 年，凯萨琳大帝在位于圣彼得堡的奥拉宁鲍姆宫中庭园建造了一座滑雪丘。
The name Russian Mountains to designate a roller coaster is preserved in many languages (e.g. the Spanish montaña rusa), but the Russian term for roller coasters is американские горки ("amerikanskiye gorki"), which translates to "American mountains."	在许多语言当中，「俄罗斯山」这个名称都是用来指称云霄飞车 (例如西班牙文的「montaña rusa」)，但是俄文中的云霄飞车却是「американские горки (『amerikanskiye gorki』)」，直译为「美国山」之意。
The first modern roller coaster, the Promenades Aeriennes, opened in Parc Beaujon in Paris on July 8, 1817.	首座现代云霄飞车为「空中漫游」(Promenades Aeriennes)，于 1817 年 7 月 8 日在巴黎的博容乐园 (Parc Beaujon) 正式营运。
It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds.	该云霄飞车的特色为轮子牢牢锁在轨道上的车厢、设有防止车厢偏离的导轨，以及更快的速度。
It spawned half a dozen imitators, but their popularity soon declined.	后来接连出现了六座仿造的云霄飞车，但是人气很快就一落千丈。
However, during the Belle Epoque they returned to fashion.	然而到了「美好年代」 (Belle Epoque) 时期，这些云霄飞车再度让大众趋之若鹜。
In 1887 French entrepreneur Joseph Oller, co-founder of the Moulin Rouge music hall, constructed the Montagnes Russes de Belleville, "Russian Mountains of Belleville" with 656 feet (200 m) of track laid out in a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.	1887 年，法国企业家 Joseph Oller (即红磨坊 (Moulin Rouge) 音乐厅的共同创办人) 打造出「美丽城俄罗斯山」(Montagnes Russes de Belleville) 云霄飞车。其长达 656 英尺 (200 公尺) 的轨道铺设成双重 8 字型回圈，后来再扩建为四重 8 字型回圈。
In 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway, a downhill gravity railroad used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania – now known as Jim Thorpe.	1827 年。有一间位于宾州萨米特山的矿业公司建造了莫赫琼克折返铁道 (Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway)，为利用重力将煤矿运到山下的宾州莫赫琼克地区 (今吉姆索普区) 的铁道。
By the 1850s, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers.	到了 1850 年代，这条「重力铁道」(后来的惯称) 开始卖票给想要追求刺激的游客。
Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.	铁道公司会在载客量少的那几天使用类似的轨道设施来提供娱乐。
Using this idea as a basis, LaMarcus Adna Thompson began work on a gravity Switchback Railway that opened at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, in 1884. Passengers climbed to the top of a platform and rode a bench-like car down the 600-foot (183 m) track up to the top of another tower where the vehicle was switched to a return track and the passengers took the return trip.	LaMarcus Adna Thompson 以此想法为基础开始设计由重力导引的「折返铁道」云霄飞车，并于 1884 年在纽约布鲁克林区的康尼岛正式营运。游客要先爬到顶端平台，然后坐上像长椅一般的的车厢，直接向下俯冲长达 600 英尺 (183 公尺) 的轨道，来到另一座高塔的顶端。车厢会在这里切换到返程轨道上，让游客沿着原路归返。
This track design was soon replaced with an oval complete circuit.	这项轨道设计很快就让完整的椭圆形回圈所取代。
In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first full-circuit coaster with a lift hill, the Gravity Pleasure Road, which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.	1885 年，Phillip Hinkle 打造出第一座设有爬升坡及完整回圈的云霄飞车 (即「重力乐遨游」(Gravity Pleasure Road)，随后成为康尼岛上最受欢迎的乐园景点。
Not to be outdone, in 1886 Thompson patented his design of roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery.	Thompson 不甘示弱，于 1886 年为自己包含了漆黑隧道和景观图画的云霄飞车设计申请了专利。
"Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county.	没过多久，「景观铁道」如雨后春笋般出现在全国各地的游乐园中。
By 1919, the first underfriction roller coaster had been developed by John Miller.	到了 1919 年，John Miller 研发出第一座低摩擦云霄飞车。
Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world.	不久，云霄飞车便出现在全球各地的游乐园中。
Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, Cyclone, was opened at Coney Island in 1927.	于 1927 年在康尼岛上正式营运的「旋风」(Cyclone) 云霄飞车，可说是史上最知名的云霄飞车。
The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, and theme parks, in general, went into decline.	经济大萧条让云霄飞车的黄金年代告终，主题乐园也普遍开始走下坡。
This lasted until 1972 when the instant success of The Racer at Kings Island began a roller coaster renaissance which has continued to this day.	直到 1972 年，「国王岛赛车手」(The Racer at Kings Island) 一夕爆红，这才让云霄飞车重返荣耀并延续至今。
In 1959, Disneyland introduced a design breakthrough with Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first roller coaster to use a tubular steel track.	1959 年，迪士尼乐园使用突破以往的设计概念上打造出「马特洪雪橇历险」 (Matterhorn Bobsleds)，这是第一座使用钢管轨道的云霄飞车。
Unlike wooden coaster rails, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, allowing designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs.	不同于木造轨道，钢轨可以往各种方向弯折，让设计师得以在设计图稿中纳入回圈、螺旋和其他许多巧妙变化。
Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden coasters and hybrids are still being built.	现代大部分的云霄飞车都是以钢铁建成。尽管如此，现在还是有人在建造木制和铁木混合的云霄飞车。
There are several explanations of the name roller coaster.	「云霄飞车」(roller coaster) 的命名缘由有好几种说法。
It is said to have originated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast.	据说这名称源自于早期的美式设计。当时会在滑坡轨道上装设滚轮，让橇板可以直接溜下去。
This design was abandoned in favor of fitting the wheels to the sled or other vehicles, but the name endured.	这项设计后来改成将轮子安装到橇板或其他设施载具上，但名称维持不变。
Another explanation is that it originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887.	另一种说法是该名称起源自 1887 年某座位于麻州黑弗里尔一处溜冰场内的游乐设施。
A toboggan-like sled was raised to the top of a track which consisted of hundreds of rollers.	载具看起像是平底雪橇，抬升到装设了上百颗滚轮的轨道上方。
This Roller Toboggan then took off down gently rolling hills to the floor.	平底雪橇飞车接着会缓缓从山丘上滑落到地面。
The inventors of this ride, Stephen E. Jackman and Byron B. Floyd, claim that they were the first to use the term "roller coaster".	这项设施的发明者为 Stephen E. Jackman 和 Byron B. Floyd，据称他们就是首先使用「roller coaster」做为名称的人。
The term jet coaster is used for roller coasters in Japan, where such amusement park rides are very popular.	日本则称云霄飞车为「喷射飞车」，在当地的游乐园中十分受欢迎。
In many languages, the name refers to "Russian mountains".	在许多语言中会以「俄罗斯山」来称呼云霄飞车。
Contrastingly, in Russian, they are called "American mountains".	俄文却反倒称呼云霄飞车为「美国山」。
In the Scandinavian languages and German, the roller coaster is referred as "mountain-and-valley railway".	在斯堪地那维亚语系和德文中，云霄飞车被称作是「山岭峻谷铁道」。
German also knows the word "Achterbahn", stemming from "Figur-8-Bahn", like Dutch "Achtbaan", relating to the form of the number 8 ("acht" in German and also Dutch).	德文也会以「Achterbahn」指称云霄飞车，其字首根源自德文的「8 字形铁道」(如同荷兰文的「Achtbaan」)，和飞车轨道的 8 字形状有所关联 (「acht」在德文和荷兰文中都有「8」的意思)。
Several height classifications have been used by parks and manufacturers in marketing their roller coasters, as well as enthusiasts within the industry.	游乐园园方和制造商在行销云霄飞车时有使用好几个高度类别，业界的云霄飞车爱好者也会跟着使用。
One classification, the kiddie coaster, is a roller coaster specifically designed for younger riders.	其中一个类别为儿童云霄飞车，专门设计给较为年幼的乘客游玩。
Following World War II, parks began pushing for more of them to be built in contrast to the height and age restrictions of standard designs at the time.	在二战过后，游乐园纷纷开始建造更多与当时年龄及身高标准限制大相径庭的儿童云霄飞车。
Companies like Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) developed scaled-down versions of their larger models to accommodate the demand.	如费城雪橇飞车公司 (Philadelphia Toboggan Company，简称 PTC) 等业者相继发展出等比缩小版的云霄飞车来顺应市场需求。
These typically featured lift hills smaller than 25 feet (7.6 m), and still do today.	一般而言，这类云霄飞车的爬坡高度会低于 25 英尺 (7.6 公尺)，至今依然如此。
The rise of kiddie coasters soon led to the development of "junior" models that had lift hills up to 45 feet (14 m).	儿童云霄飞车兴起之后没多久，将爬坡高度提高到 45 英尺 (14 公尺) 的「青少年」版于焉诞生。
A notable example of a junior coaster is the Sea Dragon – the oldest operating roller coaster from PTC's legendary designer John Allen – which opened at Wyandot Lake in 1956 near Powell, Ohio.	「海龙号」(Sea Dragon) 为青少年云霄飞车的著名典范。这是由 PTC 的传奇设计师 John Allen 所设计且至今营运历史最久远的云霄飞车，于 1956 年在邻近俄亥俄州鲍威尔市的怀恩多特湖畔正式亮相。
A hypercoaster, occasionally stylized as hyper coaster, is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least 200 feet (61 m).	超级云霄飞车 (hypercoaster，有时会分开写成 hyper coaster) 为高度落差在 200 英尺 (61 公尺) 以上的云霄飞车。
Moonsault Scramble, which debuted at Fuji-Q Highland in 1984, was the first to break this barrier, though the term hypercoaster was first coined by Cedar Point and Arrow Dynamics with the opening of Magnum XL-200 in 1989.	1984 年在日本富士急乐园 (Fuji-Q Highland) 初次亮相的「银月瀑布争霸战」(Moonsault Scramble) 为首座突破这项高度障碍的云霄飞车。不过，「超级云霄飞车」这个词汇却是迟至 1989 年才由杉点主题乐园 (Cedar Point) 和箭矢动力公司 (Arrow Dynamics) 在「麦格努姆 XL-200 」云霄飞车开张时创造出来。
Hypercoasters have become one of the most predominant types of roller coasters in the world, now led by manufacturers Bolliger & Mabillard and Intamin.	超级云霄飞车现已成为全球首屈一指的主流云霄飞车类型，Bolliger & Mabillard 和 Intamin 为两大龙头制造商。
Salmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes.	鲑鱼一般会在高纬度地区的淡水河流中产卵。
The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry.	鱼卵会孵化出鱼苗或囊鱼苗。
The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes.	鱼苗很快就会长成幼鲑，身上出现五彩斑斓的垂直条纹。
The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off.	幼鲑要在自己出生的河流中待上六个月到三年才会变成银色小鲑鱼，身上会出现明亮的银白色以及容易刮除的鱼鳞。
Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.	据估计只有一成的鲑鱼卵能够存活到这个阶段。
The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water.	银色小鲑鱼体内的化学物质产生变化，让它们能够在盐水里生活。
While a few species of salmon remain in fresh water throughout their life cycle, the majority are anadromous and migrate to the ocean for maturation: in these species, smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.	虽然有少数几种鲑鱼一辈子都离不开淡水环境，但多数鲑鱼都会回游并会迁徙到海中成长为成鱼。这些种类的银色小鲑鱼会在迁徙入海的过程中到半咸水里待上一段时间，好让体内的化学物质逐渐适应海水的渗透压。
The salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature.	鲑鱼会在大海中待上一到五年 (视品种而有所不同)，在此渐渐达到性成熟。
The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn.	成年的鲑鱼随后会洄游而上，主要是为了回到出生地产卵。
Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea.	大西洋鲑会在海中待上一到四年。
When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. Grilse may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.	加拿大、英国和爱尔兰会称呼在海中仅待满一年就洄游而上的鲑鱼为「年轻鲑鱼」(grilse)。年轻鲑鱼会出现在产卵地点，然后趁大型雄鱼不注意的时候，将自己的精子撒在卵上。
Prior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon undergo changes.	鲑鱼会视品种不同在产卵之前有所转变。
They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon).	它们可能会背部隆起、长出尖牙或是下颚变得更发达 (雄鲑鱼的下颚会更加突出)。
All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour.	所有鲑鱼都会从银蓝色的淡水鱼转变成深色的海鱼。
Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce.	鲑鱼的旅程可说是令人敬佩万分，有时候会逆流而上数百英里，为了繁衍后代不惜力抗强劲水流和急流。
Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over 1,400 km (900 mi) and climb nearly 2,100 m (7,000 ft) from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn.	例如来自爱达荷州中部的帝王鲑和红鲑，它们会从太平洋逆流而行超过 1,400 公里 (约 900 英里) 并攀跃至将近 2,100 公尺 (约 7,000 英尺) 的山上产卵。
Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts.	鲑鱼在淡水里待越久，身体状况就会越来越差，到了产卵之后更是每况愈下。这时候的鲑鱼会被称为「产后鲑」(kelt)。
In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity.	所有品种的太平洋鲑鱼都会在成熟并产卵后的数天或数周内死亡，这样的特征称为「单次繁殖」(semelparity)。
Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females.	在所有雌性鲑鱼当中，只有 2% 到 4% 的大西洋产后鲑鱼能够活到再次产卵。
However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%).	然而，即使这些品种的鲑鱼能够活着产卵一次以上 (多次繁殖)，产卵后的死亡率也相当高 (约莫四成到五成)。
To lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd.	雌鲑鱼会为了产卵用自己的尾巴 (尾鳍) 拍打出一个低压区，扬起碎石让河流冲走，清理出一个名为「产卵区」(redd) 的浅坑。
The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering 2.8 m² (30 sq ft).	产卵区有时可容纳 5,000 颗鱼卵，面积达 2.8 平方公尺 (约 30 平方英尺)。
The eggs usually range from orange to red.	鱼卵的颜色通常介于橘色到红色之间。
One or more males approach the female in her redd, depositing sperm, or milt, over the roe.	会有一只以上的雄鲑鱼游到待在自己的产卵区内的雌鲑鱼身边，将精子或精液撒在鱼卵上。
The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd.	雌鲑鱼接着会将浅坑上游侧的碎石拨过来盖住鱼卵，然后再去挖出另一个产卵区。
The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.	雌鲑鱼在耗尽自己产出的鱼卵之前，最多可完成七个产卵区。
Each year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter.	每一年，鲑鱼通常会在夏季迎来快速成长期，然后成长速度一般会在冬季趋缓。
This results in ring formation around an earbone called the otolith (annuli), analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk.	这会造成鱼类耳石 (otolith) 的环状纹路 (年轮)，类似在树干中会见到随着年龄增长而出现的环状纹路。
Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.	在淡水环境中的生长年轮纹路十分密集，在海洋环境中的生长年轮纹路则间隙较宽。产卵期会出现明显的纹路痕迹，因为其身体质量会在这时期转化为鱼卵和精液。
Freshwater streams and estuaries provide important habitat for many salmon species.	淡水河流和河口区域为许多鲑鱼品种提供了重要的栖地环境。
They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older.	这些鲑鱼会在幼年时以陆地和水中的昆虫、端足虫和其他甲壳类动物为食，成年后则主要以其他鱼类为猎食对象。
Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel, and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) to the developing embryos.	鱼卵会产在碎石颗粒较大的深水区，并且需要沁凉且流动状况良好 (利于供氧) 的水域环境来协助胚胎生长。
Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow.	处于幼年阶段的鲑鱼，由于会遇到自然界中的掠食者以及土石淤积、水温过高、氧气浓度不足、缺少溪流蔽荫以及河川流量减少等人为造成的栖地环境变迁，死亡率通常居高不下。
Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean.	在鲑鱼离开栖地前往广阔海洋之前，河口地区及邻近相连的湿地可提供至关重要的养育环境。
Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.	湿地不仅能协助缓解河口地区的淤积及污染危害，也能提供重要的觅食及蔽荫区域。
Salmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration (phenoptosis, or "programmed aging") at the end of their lives.	幸免于难而存活下来的鲑鱼，在生命走到尽头时会出现急遽劣化 (衰亡，或称作「程式性老化」)。
Their bodies rapidly deteriorate right after they spawn as a result of the release of massive amounts of corticosteroids.	它们的身体会因为在产卵期间释出了大量的皮质类固醇而快速劣化。
In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species, supporting wildlife such as birds, bears and otters.	鲑鱼为太平洋西北部海域和阿拉斯加地区的关键物种，让当地的鸟类、熊类和其他野生物种得以存续。
The bodies of salmon represent a transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, to the forest ecosystem.	鲑鱼的身体富含氮、硫、碳和磷等元素，为将海洋中的营养素转移至森林生态系统中的代表物种。
Grizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent wooded areas.	灰熊会捕食鲑鱼并将鲑鱼带到邻近的林地区域，其作用相当于生态系统工程师。
There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses.	它们会在林地排泄富含营养素的尿液和粪便，以及没吃完的鲑鱼残骸。
Bears are estimated to leave up to half the salmon they harvest on the forest floor, in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms per hectare, providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands.	据估算，熊在林地间遗弃的鲑鱼残骸数量可达原先捕获量的一半，密度达到每公顷 4,000 公斤，最多可提供岸边林地 24% 的有效氮含量。
The foliage of spruce trees up to 500 m (1,600 ft) from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.	在灰熊捕食鲑鱼的溪流附近，有人发现高达 500 公尺 (1.600 英尺) 的云杉树树叶中含有源自于鲑鱼残骸的氮元素。
It has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys, loss of the lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way.	有些河川出现了洄游性七鳃鳗数量减少或消失无踪等状况，这也会对鲑鱼造成负面影响。
Like salmon, anadromous lampreys stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream.	洄游性七鳃鳗和鲑鱼一样会在产卵后不再觅食并迈向死亡，并在遗骸分解后将营养素释放到溪流中。
Also, along with species like rainbow trout and Sacramento sucker, lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning.	此外，七鳃鳗和虹鳟及沙加缅度亚口鱼一样会在产卵时清除河中碎石。
Their larvae, called ammocoetes, are filter feeders which contribute to the health of the waters.	其幼体名为沙隐虫，为滤食性动物，可协助维护水域的健康状态。
They are also a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed predators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on smolts.	沙隐虫也是幼年鲑鱼的食物来源之一，而且因为沙隐虫比鲑鱼幼苗更为肥美，理应会更受掠食者喜爱，进而分担了幼鲑遭到掠食的生存压力。
Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and sea lions, which can eat 30 lampreys to every salmon, allowing more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine mammals.	成年的七鳃鳗也是较受海豹和海狮喜爱的猎物，后者每多捕食 30 条七鳃鳗就会少捕食 1 尾鲑鱼，进而让更多成年鲑鱼得以游回河中产卵，免遭海洋哺乳类大快朵颐。
According to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxozoan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids.	据加拿大生物学家 Dorothy Kieser 指出，鲑生黏孢子虫 (Henneguya salminicola) 为鲑鱼鱼肉中常见的黏体寄生虫。
It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Haida Gwaii Islands.	这类寄生虫可见于返回海达瓜依群岛 (Haida Gwaii Islands) 的鲑鱼田调样本纪录中。
The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid.	鲑鱼体内会设法将受到寄生虫感染的部位围堵起来，进而形成数个内含乳白色液体的囊肿。
This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.	该乳白色液体中积聚了大量寄生虫。
Henneguya and other parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon is one of two hosts.	黏孢子虫和其他同属黏体动物的寄生虫都有着复杂的生命周期，而鲑鱼是其双宿主之一。
The fish releases the spores after spawning.	感染后的鱼会在产卵后释放孢子。
In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream.	举黏孢子虫为例，其孢子会在这时进入到第二位宿主体内，大部分会是产卵溪流中的无脊椎动物。
When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon.	当年幼鲑鱼迁居至太平洋时，第二位宿主就会随之进入鲑鱼传染阶段。
The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle.	接着寄生虫就会待在鲑鱼体内，直到下一次产卵周期到来为止，
The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle.	会导致鳟鱼染上回旋病 (whirling disease) 的黏体寄生虫有着类似的生命周期。
However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon—even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.	然而，黏孢子虫却反其道而行，它并不会导致其鲑鱼宿主染疫，鲑鱼即使重度感染还是能够顺利洄游产卵。
According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states, "the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections.	据 Kieser 博士指出，早在 1980 年代中期，位于纳奈莫 (Nanaimo) 的太平洋生物研究站 (Pacific Biological Station) 中就有科学家针对黏孢子虫进行了许多研究，尤其是在一份综览报告中指出：「幼年时期在淡水栖地的居住时间最长的鲑鱼，其感染状况最为明显。」
Hence in order of prevalence, coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink.	因此，若依感染盛行率排序，则银鲑最容易遭到感染，再来是红钩吻鲑、帝王鲑、钩吻鲑和粉红鲑。
As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., "are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection." The report also states, "It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health.	报告中提到，在进行研究当下，位于英属哥伦比亚境内大河流域 (如弗雷泽河、斯基纳河、纳斯河等) 的上、中游区以及来自南部沿海溪流的鱼群「均可能有较低的感染盛行率」。报告中也提到：「尽管黏孢子虫在经济方面会造成危害，但我们也应强调其并不会危害到公共卫生。
It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man".	这是只有鱼类会感染到的寄生虫，无法在如人类般的温血动物体内存活或造成影响」。
According to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, "Henneguya salminicola is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon.	据与加拿大食品检验局合作的软壳贝类监管计划专家 Klaus Schallie 出：「黏孢子虫也有在英属哥伦比亚南部出现，而且所有品种的鲑鱼无一幸免。
I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation."	我之前检验了上面满是囊肿的烟熏秋鲑切片，以及在巴克利湾 (位于英属哥伦比亚南部及温哥华岛西岸) 出没且以高感染率闻名的红钩吻鲑。 」
Sea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon.	海虱，尤其是鲑鱼虱和各种鱼虱 (包含 C. clemensi 和 C. rogercresseyi 等品种) 会对人工养殖和野生鲑鱼造成致命的感染危害。
Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days.	海虱为体外寄生虫，以黏液、血液和皮肤为食。它会在游离、浮游体和桡足体等阶段迁徙并牢牢附生在野生鲑鱼的表皮上，时间可长达好几天。
Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms	大量且高度群聚的开放式鲑鱼养殖场
can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result.	可能会聚集数量异常庞大的海虱。有许多年幼的野生鲑鱼在接触到辟建了大量开放式养殖场的河口地区后，会接连受到感染并因此丧命。
Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable.	成年鲑鱼可在数量达到临界值的海虱群中存活下来，但个头娇小、表皮细薄且刚刚迁徙到海洋中的幼年鲑鱼则十分脆弱。
On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.	在加拿大的太平洋沿岸，有些地区的粉红鲑的虱害死亡率往往都会超过八成。
The risk of injury caused by underwater pile driving has been studied by Dr. Halvorsen and her co-workers.	Halvorsen 博士和她的同事共同研究了水下打桩作业导致鱼群受伤的风险。
The study concluded that the fish are at risk of injury if the cumulative sound exposure level exceeds 210 dB relative to 1 μPa² s.	研究结果显示，如果累计噪音暴露位准超过 210 分贝 (re. 1 μPa² s)，就会产生鱼群受伤的风险。
As can be seen from the production chart at the left, the global capture reported by different countries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon has remained fairly steady since 1990 at about one million tonnes per year.	如左方生产图表所示，自 1990 年以来，世界各国向联合国粮食及农业组织 (FAO) 回报的商用野生鲑鱼捕获量均维持在每年约一百万吨，相当稳定，
This is in contrast to farmed salmon (below) which has increased in the same period from about 0.6 million tonnes to well over two million tonnes.	人工养殖的鲑鱼则大相径庭 (请见下方图表)，在同样一段时间内从约六十万吨成长至超过二百万吨。
Nearly all captured wild salmon are Pacific salmon.	几乎所有被捕获的野生鲑鱼都是太平洋鲑鱼。
The capture of wild Atlantic salmon has always been relatively small, and has declined steadily since 1990.	大西洋野生鲑鱼的捕获量一直以来都不多，而且从 1990 年以来每况愈下。
In 2011 only 2,500 tonnes were reported.	在 2011 年仅回报了 2,500 吨。
In contrast about half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.	相比之下，有半数的人工养殖鲑鱼为大西洋鲑鱼。
Recreational salmon fishing can be a technically demanding kind of sport fishing, not necessarily congenial for beginning fishermen.	钓鲑鱼为相当需要技巧的休闲钓鱼活动，对于初学者而言不太好上手。
A conflict exists between commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for the right to salmon stock resources.	渔民和钓客之间在捕捞鲑鱼鱼群资源的权利方面有所冲突。
Commercial fishing in estuaries and coastal areas is often restricted so enough salmon can return to their natal rivers where they can spawn and be available for sport fishing.	在河口及岸边区域的渔业活动通常会有所限制，好让足量的鲑鱼能够返回原生河流产卵并提供休闲渔业所需。
On parts of the North American west coast sport salmon fishing completely replaces inshore commercial fishing.	在北美西岸，有部分地区的钓鲑鱼休闲产业完全取代了近海渔业。
In most cases, the commercial value of a salmon can be several times less than the value attributed to the same fish caught by a sport fisherman.	在大多数情况下，同一尾鲑鱼的商业价值会比让休闲钓客捕捞所能贡献的价值还要低上好几倍。
This is "a powerful economic argument for allocating stock resources preferentially to sport fishing."	这项「经济论证铿锵有力，支持将鱼群资源优先分配给休闲渔业」。
Salmon aquaculture is a major contributor to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10 billion annually.	鲑鱼养殖为全球养殖渔业的主力大户，每年产值约一百亿美元。
Other commonly cultured fish species include tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream.	其他养殖渔业常见的鱼种包括吴郭鱼、鲶鱼、鲈鱼、鲤鱼和鲂鱼等。
Salmon farming is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe.	智利、挪威、苏格兰、加拿大和法罗群岛等地的鲑鱼养殖业十分盛行，为美国和欧洲大部分市售鲑鱼的货源。
Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and Tasmania, Australia.	在俄国和l澳洲的塔斯马尼亚州等地也有人在养殖大西洋鲑鱼 (但数量很少)。
Salmon are carnivorous.	鲑鱼为肉食性动物。
They are fed a meal produced from catching other wild fish and other marine organisms.	它们会以捕捉到的其他野生鱼类和海洋生物为食。
Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish.	鲑鱼养殖需要大量的野生饵料鱼。
Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product.	鲑鱼需要摄取大量的蛋白质来补充营养，而养殖渔场中的鲑鱼会消耗掉比最终成鱼肉量还要多的饵料鱼。
On a dry weight basis, 2–4 kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produce one kg of salmon.	以净重计算，要产出一公斤的鲑鱼肉，会需要捕捞二至四公斤的野生鱼类。
As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.	随着鲑鱼养殖产业规模扩展，野生饵料鱼的需求量也越来越大，全球各地受到监控的渔场一度有七成五已经接近或超过其最大永续产量。
The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.	鲑鱼养殖产业大规模捕捞野生饵料鱼，影响到仰赖饵料鱼为食的野生掠食鱼种的生存能力。
Work continues on substituting vegetable proteins for animal proteins in the salmon diet.	目前还在继续尝试以植物蛋白质替代鲑鱼饮食中的动物蛋白质。
This substitution results in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 fatty acid content in the farmed product.	结果替代饮食导致养殖鱼肉中珍贵的 Omega-3 脂肪酸含量减少。
Intensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs.	密集养殖的鲑鱼渔场会使用开放式箱网，其生产成本低廉。
Persea americana is a tree that grows to 20 m (66 ft), with alternately arranged leaves 12–25 cm (4.7–9.8 in) long.	酪梨树可成长至 20 公尺 (66 英尺) 高，具有互生叶序的树叶可长达 12-25 公分 (4.7-9.8 英吋)。
Panicles of flowers with deciduous bracts arise from new growth or the axils of leaves.	具圆锥花序且苞片易落的新生花苞会从叶腋间冒出来。
The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) wide.	花苞本身并不显眼，花色黄中带绿，宽度 5-10 公厘 (约 0.2-0.4 英吋)。
The species is variable because of selection pressure by humans to produce larger, fleshier fruits with a thinner exocarp.	人们为了产出更大、果肉更厚实且果皮更薄透的果实，在选择压力下造就了各式各样的品种。
The avocado fruit is a climacteric, single-seeded berry, due to the imperceptible endocarp covering the seed, rather than a drupe.	酪梨果为更年型的单子浆果，其种子外表有一层难以察觉的内果皮，而非核果。
The pear-shaped fruit is 7–20 cm (2.8–7.9 in) long, weighs between 100 and 1,000 g (3.5 and 35.3 oz), and has a large central seed, 5–6.4 cm (2.0–2.5 in) long.	这种梨形水果的长度为 7-20 公分 (约 2.8-7.9 英吋)，重量介于 100 克至 1,000 克之间 (约 3.5 盎司至 35.3 盎司之间)，中间还有颗长达 5-6.4 公分的硕大种子。
Persea americana, or the avocado, possibly originated in the Tehuacan Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico, although fossil evidence suggests similar species were much more widespread millions of years ago.	酪梨很有可能起源自墨西哥普埃布拉州的提瓦坎谷中，尽管化石佐证了类似的品种早已在数百万年前遍及更加广阔的地带。
However, there is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the avocado, resulting in the currently recognized Mexican (aoacatl), Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), and West Indian (tlacacolaocatl) landraces.	然而，有证据指出三处可能的酪梨驯化培育地点，造就出目前可分辨出来的墨西哥种 (aoactl)、瓜地马拉种 (quilaoacatl) 及西印度种 (tlacacolaocatl) 等地方品种。
The Mexican and Guatemalan landraces originated in the highlands of those countries, while the West Indian landrace is a lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range through human agency before the arrival of the Europeans.	墨西哥种和瓜地马拉种起源自这两个国家的高地区域，西印度种则遍及瓜地马拉、哥斯大黎加、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多及秘鲁等地的低地区域，在欧洲人抵达之前透过人为传播达成大范围的种植成果。
The three separate landraces were most likely to have already intermingled in pre-Columbian America and were described in the Florentine Codex.	这三种不同的地方品种很有可能在哥伦布造访美洲之前就混杂在一起，并记载于「佛罗伦斯手抄本」(Florentine Codex) 中。
The earliest residents were living in temporary camps in an ancient wetland eating avocados, chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds, and sea lions.	最早期的居民住在古老湿地上的临时聚落，以酪梨、辣椒、软体动物、鲨鱼、鸟类和海狮为食。
The oldest discovery of an avocado pit comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to 10,000 years ago.	目前发现年代最久远的酪梨籽来自卡克斯凯特洞穴 (Coxcatlan Cave)，可追溯至约九千至一万年前。
Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley from around the same time period also show early evidence for the presence of avocado.	其他位于提瓦坎谷区且年代相近的洞穴内也都有证据佐证早年的酪梨踪影。
There is evidence for avocado use at Norte Chico civilization sites in Peru by at least 3,200 years ago and at Caballo Muerto in Peru from around 3,800 to 4,500 years ago.	秘鲁的小北文明 (Norte Chico) 聚落遗址有至少 3,200 年前的酪梨食用证据，该国的卡巴罗穆尔托 (Caballo Muerto) 遗址则出土了大约 3,800 年至 4,500 年前的佐证物件。
The native, undomesticated variety is known as a criollo, and is small, with dark black skin, and contains a large seed.	未经人类驯化的原生种称为克里奥罗种 (criollo)，体积小且表皮颜色深黑，果实内有硕大的种子。
It probably coevolved with extinct megafauna.	它有可能是与绝种的巨型动物共同演化而来。
The avocado tree also has a long history of cultivation in Central and South America, likely beginning as early as 5,000 BC.	酪梨果树在中美洲及南美洲等地区有着悠久的栽种历史，最早可追溯至西元前 5,000 年。
A water jar shaped like an avocado, dating to AD 900, was discovered in the pre-Incan city of Chan Chan.	在印加帝国之前的昌昌 (Chan Chan) 古城内出土了一个西元 900 年的酪梨型水壶。
The earliest known written account of the avocado in Europe is that of Martín Fernández de Enciso (circa 1470–1528) in 1519 in his book, Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo.	目前已知欧洲最早提及酪梨的文献为 Martín Fernández de Enciso (1470–1528) 于 1519 年出版的《世界地理大全》(Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo)。
The first detailed account that unequivocally describes the avocado was given by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in his work Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias in 1526.	首篇巨细靡遗描写酪梨的文献则为 Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés 于 1526 年出版的《西印度群岛自然史概述》(Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias)。
The first written record in English of the use of the word 'avocado' was by Hans Sloane, who coined the term, in a 1696 index of Jamaican plants.	英文中的酪梨 (avocado) 首见于 1696 年出版的《牙买加植物索引》(Index of Jamaican Plants)，由 Hans Sloane 创造出来。
The plant was introduced to Spain in 1601, Indonesia around 1750, Mauritius in 1780, Brazil in 1809, the United States mainland in 1825, South Africa and Australia in the late 19th century, and Israel in 1908.	酪梨于 1601 年引进到西班牙，约莫于 1750 年来到印尼、于 1780 年至模里西斯、1809 年至巴西、1825 年扎根美国、十九世纪晚期来到南非和澳洲，并于 1908 年引进到以色列。
In the United States, the avocado was introduced to Florida and Hawaii in 1833 and in California in 1856.	在美国境内，佛罗里达州及夏威夷均于 1833 年引进酪梨，加州则于 1856 年引进。
Before 1915, the avocado was commonly referred to in California as ahuacate and in Florida as alligator pear.	在 1915 年之前，加州人通常将酪梨称为「ahuacate/aguacate」，佛州人则称之为鳄梨 (alligator pear)。
In 1915, the California Avocado Association introduced the then-innovative term avocado to refer to the plant.	1915 年，加州酪梨协会将当时仍相当新颖的「avocado」一词介绍给普罗大众，当作正式名称。
The word "avocado" comes from the Spanish aguacate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ], which goes back to the proto-Aztecan *pa:wa which also meant "avocado".	「avocado」一词源自于西班牙文中的「aguacate」，再往前可追溯至纳瓦特尔语 (Nahuatl) 的「āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ]」，追本溯源则为原始阿兹特克语中的「*pa:wa」，即现今的「酪梨」之意。
Sometimes the Nahuatl word was used with the meaning "testicle", probably because of the likeness between the fruit and the body part.	纳瓦特尔语中的酪梨有时候会用来指称「睪丸」，有可能是因为这种水果长得很像该身体部位。
The modern English name comes from an English rendering of the Spanish aguacate as avogato.	现代的英文名称则是将西班牙文中的「aguacate」转译为「avogato」而来。
The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as "avogato pear", a term which was later corrupted as "alligator pear".	经证实，目前已知最早曾于 1697 在英文的书面文献中出现「avogato pear」一词，之后则误植为「alligator pear」(鳄梨)。
Because the word avogato sounded like "advocate", several languages reinterpreted it to have that meaning.	因为「avogato」一词念起来音似「倡议」(advocate)，有些语言会据此重新诠释该词含意。
French uses avocat, which also means lawyer, and "advocate" — forms of the word appear in several Germanic languages, such as the (now obsolete) German Advogato-Birne, the old Danish advokat-pære (today it is called avocado) and the Dutch advocaatpeer.	法文会使用「avocat」来指称酪梨，该词同时也有「律师」和「倡议」之意。该词语的变形也出现在数种日耳曼语系的语言当中，诸如德文的「酪梨」为「Advogato-Birne」(现已过时)、丹麦文的酪梨旧称为「advokat-pære」(现今已更名为「avocado」)，荷兰文则是「advocaatpeer」。
In other Central American and Caribbean Spanish-speaking countries, it is known by the Mexican name, while South American Spanish-speaking countries use a Quechua-derived word, palta.	在中美洲以及加勒比海地区的其他西语系国家都使用墨西哥文称呼酪梨，南美洲的西语系国家则使用源自克丘亚语 (Quenchua) 的「palta」。
In Portuguese, it is abacate.	葡萄牙文中的酪梨为「abacate」。
The fruit is sometimes called an avocado pear or alligator pear (due to its shape and the rough green skin of some cultivars).	该水果有时会被称为「睪梨」或「鳄梨」(因为其形似睪丸，且某些品种具有粗糙的绿色果皮)。
The Nahuatl āhuacatl can be compounded with other words, as in ahuacamolli, meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word guacamole derives.	纳瓦特尔语的「āhuacatl」可以和其他词语组成复合词，比如「ahuacamolli」(意思是酪梨汤或酪梨酱汁)。西班牙文中的「酪梨酱」(guacamole) 即源自于此。
In the United Kingdom, the term avocado pear is still sometimes misused as applied when avocados first became commonly available in the 1960s.	当酪梨于 1960 年代首度成为英国常见的蔬果之后，仍然时而有人误用「avocado pear」(睪梨) 一词称之。
Originating as a diminutive in Australian English, a clipped form, avo, has since become a common colloquialism in South Africa and the United Kingdom.	「avo」原为澳洲英文用来简称酪梨的省略语，后来成为南非及英国常见的口语词汇。
It is known as "butter fruit" in parts of India.	酪梨在印度境内的部分地区有「奶油果」之称。
The subtropical species needs a climate without frost and with little wind.	这种副热带水果需要不会结霜且有微风拂面而来的气候。
High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination.	疾风吹拂会让湿度降低，导致花苞脱水，进而影响授粉。
When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur, although the 'Hass' cultivar can tolerate temperatures down to −1 °C.	尽管哈斯 (Hass) 酪梨已经可以忍受摄氏零下 1 度的低温，但即便只有轻微结霜，还是有可能发生提早落果的现象。
Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of Gainesville, Florida, which survive temperatures as low as −6.5 °C (20 °F) with only minor leaf damage.	有些耐寒的品种会种植在佛罗里达州的盖恩斯维尔 (Gainesville) 地区，能够在摄氏零下 6.5 度 (华氏 20 度) 的低温下存活，仅有少数叶子会为此凋萎。
The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep.	果树本身也需要透气良好的土壤，理想深度为 1 公尺以上。
According to information published by the Water Footprint Network, it takes an average of approximately 70 litres (18 US gal) of applied fresh ground or surface water, not including rainfall or natural moisture in the soil, to grow one avocado.	据水足迹网络 (Water Footprint Network) 公开发布的资讯指出，要种出一株酪梨，平均需要用到大约 70 公升 (约 18 加仑) 的地下或地面的淡水，不包括降雨或土壤中自然含有的水分。
However, the amount of water needed depends on where it is grown; for example, in the main avocado-growing region of Chile, about 320 litres (85 US gal) of applied water are needed to grow one avocado.	然而，所需水量仍取决于生长地区。例如在智利境内的主要酪梨种植区，要种植一株酪梨所需要用到的水量大约是 320 公升 (85 加仑)。
Yield is reduced when the irrigation water is highly saline.	若灌溉用水的盐分含量高，则产量会随之减少。
These soil and climate conditions are available in southern and eastern Colombia, Morocco, the Levant, South Africa, Venezuela, Spain, Peru, parts of central and northern Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of southern India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, southern California, Arizona, Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, Hawaii, Ecuador, and Rwanda.	具有这些土壤和气候条件的地区有哥伦比亚南部和东部地区、摩洛哥、黎凡特地区 (the Levant)、南非、委内瑞拉、西班牙、秘鲁、智利中部和北部的部分地区、越南、印尼、印度南部的部分地区、斯里兰卡、澳洲、纽西兰、菲律宾、马来西亚、中美洲、加勒比海地区、墨西哥、南加州、亚利桑那州、波多黎各、德州、佛罗里达州、夏威夷、厄瓜多和卢安达等。
Each region has different cultivars.	每一个地区都有各自不同的品种。
Commercial orchards produce an average of seven tonnes per hectare each year, with some orchards achieving 20 tonnes per hectare.	商业果园的平均产量为每年每公顷七公吨，有些果园的产量可达到每公顷二十公吨。
Biennial bearing can be a problem, with heavy crops in one year being followed by poor yields the next.	二年生植物的特性可能会造成问题，导致某一年盛产但隔年却产量锐减。
Like the banana, the avocado is a climacteric fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree.	酪梨和香蕉一样都是更年型水果，会在树上逐渐成熟，但要在采摘下来之后才会熟透。
Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at 3.3 to 5.6 °C (37.9 to 42.1 °F) until they reach their final destination.	在市面上贩售的酪梨会趁果肉生硬且表皮青绿时摘下来，然后冷藏在摄氏 3.3 度至 5.6 度 (华氏 37.9 度至 42.1 度) 中，直到抵达最终站。
Avocados must be mature to ripen properly.	酪梨必须在妥善条件下从成熟至熟透。
Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground.	从树上掉落的酪梨会在地上熟透腐烂。
Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick 'Hass' avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards.	通常来说，这种水果一旦成熟了就可以摘下来。墨西哥的果农会在哈斯酪梨的干物质比例达 23% 以上的时候把它摘下来，其他酪梨生产国也有类似的采摘标准。
Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at room temperature (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of ethylene gas).	在摘下来之后，室温下的酪梨会在一至二周内熟透 (取决于酪梨品种。如果和苹果或香蕉之类的水果一同储存，会因为释放出乙烯气体的关系而加快熟成速度)。
Some supermarkets sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening.	有些超市会贩售以合成乙烯加快熟成速度的完熟酪梨。
The use of an ethylene gas "ripening room", which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of Escondido, California, in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them "back in the bin," and moving on without making a purchase.	使用乙烯气体的「熟成室」如今已是业界的标准配备，当初是在 1980 年代由加州艾斯康迪多市 (Escondido) 的农民 Gil Henry 开创先河。他在超市的隐藏摄影机画面中看到顾客重复捏着尚未熟透的硬酪梨，接着把酪梨「物归原位」，连一颗都不买就继续往前走，因此才起心动念。
In some cases, avocados can be left on the tree for several months, which is an advantage to commercial growers who seek the greatest return for their crop, but if the fruit remains unpicked for too long, it falls to the ground.	在某些情况下，酪梨可以在树上待好几个月，这有利于为自己的农作物寻求最佳报酬的农民。但如果隔了太久仍未采收，果实还是会落地。
Avocados can be propagated by seed, taking roughly four to six years to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing.	酪梨可以透过种子繁殖，大约四到六年就会结果，不过在某些状况下，种子种下去后会花上十年才会结出果实。
The offspring is unlikely to be identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality.	子代结出的果实品质不见得会与同品种的亲代一模一样。
Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (clonal rootstocks).	因此，优质品种要靠嫁接到由种子繁殖 (实生砧木) 或压条繁殖 (营养砧木) 的砧木来繁衍后代。
After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted.	大约在温室中栽植一年后，年轻的砧木就可以准备进行嫁接了。
Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used.	顶端嫁接和侧腹嫁接为常用的嫁接方法。
The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold.	接穗品种的幼枝会再栽植 6 至 12 个月才能准备全株出售。
Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.	营养砧木会在需要耐受特定的土壤及疾患条件时雀屏中选，例如土壤的透气条件不佳，或是要抵御由疫病菌 (Phytophthora) 造成的土壤病害 (根腐病)。
Commercial avocado production is limited to a small fraction of the vast genetic diversity in the species.	在五花八门的酪梨品种当中，会进行商业量产的酪梨仅限于一小部分。
Conservation of this genetic diversity has relied largely on field collection, as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks.	要保存如此多元的基因样态，大部分得仰赖田野采集，因为酪梨籽通常无法在种子银行中长久储存。
This is problematic, as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive, and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars.	这样其实十分麻烦，因为要在田野间保存各品种的活株，所费不赀，而且栖地丧失也威胁着野生品种的存续。
More recently, an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees.	近期以来，有人发展出保存种子的替代方法。该方法的基础构想为以超低温保存酪梨的体胚，再透过可靠的体胚形成方法重新培植出活株。
Avocado trees are vulnerable to bacterial, viral, fungal, and nutritional diseases (excesses and deficiencies of key minerals).	酪梨果树对于细菌、病毒、真菌和营养方面的疾病 (过量摄取或缺乏关键的矿物质) 几无招架之力。
Disease can affect all parts of the plant, causing spotting, rotting, cankers, pitting, and discoloration.	疾病会影响到果树全株，导致表皮出现斑点、腐烂、溃疡、凹陷和变色。
Mexico is by far the world's largest avocado growing country, producing several times more than the second largest producer.	目前墨西哥是全球最大的酪梨生产国，其产量是第二大生产国的好几倍。
In 2013, the total area dedicated to avocado production was 188,723 hectares (415,520 acres), and the harvest was 2.03 million tonnes in 2017.	2013 年，专门用来栽植酪梨的区域总面积达到 188,723 公顷 (约 415,520 英亩)。 2017 年，收获量达到 203 万公吨。
The states that produce the most are México, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, and Michoacan, accounting for 86% of the total.	产量名列前茅的州有墨西哥州、莫雷洛斯州、纳亚里特州、普埃布拉州和米却肯州，加总起来可达到总产量的八成六。
In Michoacán, the cultivation is complicated by the existence of drug cartels that extort protection fees from cultivators.	要在米却肯州栽种蔬果有相当难度，因为当地的贩毒集团会向果农索讨保护费。
They are reported to exact 2000 Mexican pesos per hectare from avocado farmers and 1 to 3 pesos/kg of harvested fruit.	据报导指出，酪梨农民每公顷得缴交 2,000 墨西哥披索的保护费，每收成一公斤的酪梨得缴交 1 至 3 披索。
The avocado was introduced from Mexico to California in the 19th century, and has become a successful cash crop.	酪梨于十九世纪从墨西哥引进到加州，并顺利成为当地的摇钱树。
About 59,000 acres (240 km²) – some 95% of United States avocado production – is located in Southern California, with 60% in San Diego County.	大约有 59,000 英亩 (240 平方公里) 的酪梨园 (产量将近为美国酪梨总产量的九成五) 位于南加州，其中有六成位于圣地牙哥郡。
Fallbrook, California claims, without official recognition, the title of "Avocado Capital of the World" (also claimed by the town of Uruapan in Mexico), and both Fallbrook and Carpinteria, California, host annual avocado festivals.	加州的佛布鲁克地区自称为 (尚无官方认证)「世界酪梨之都」(墨西哥的乌鲁阿潘镇也同样如此自称)，与加州卡平特里亚市均会举办一年一度的酪梨节庆活动。
Avocado is the official fruit of the State of California.	酪梨为加州官方认定的代表水果。
Hass avocado production in Peru encompasses thousands of hectares in central and western Peru.	秘鲁的哈斯酪梨产区囊括了中部及西部地区上千公顷的土地。
Peru has now become the largest supplier of avocados imported to the European Union and the second largest supplier to Asia and the United States.	秘鲁现已成为欧盟国家第一大进口酪梨供应国，且为亚洲及美国地区的第二大酪梨供应国。
Peru's location near the equator and along the Pacific Ocean creates consistently mild temperatures year round.	秘鲁邻近赤道且位处太平洋沿岸地区，造就当地长年稳定的适温环境。
The soil is rich and sandy and the towering Andes mountains provide a constant flow of pure water for irrigation.	当地土壤肥沃且土质细致，高耸的安地斯山脉提供了稳定且纯净的灌溉水源。
Naturally sheltered as it is from heavy rain or freezing temperatures, Peru is an almost perfect climate for the cultivation of avocados.	秘鲁的天然环境中既无狂风暴雨也无寒冻低温，几乎可说是最适合栽种酪梨的绝佳气候。
Hass avocados from Peru are seasonally available to consumers from May through September and are promoted under the auspices of the Peruvian Avocado Commission, headquartered in Washington, D.C.	每年五月到九月为秘鲁哈斯酪梨的销售旺季，由总部位于华盛顿特区的秘鲁酪梨委员会 (Peruvian Avocado Commission) 负责促销宣传等事宜。
Other avocado cultivars include 'Spinks'.	其他酪梨品种还包括了「史宾克斯」(Spinks)。
Historically attested varieties (which may or may not survive among horticulturists) include the 'Challenge', 'Dickinson', 'Kist', 'Queen', 'Rey', 'Royal', 'Sharpless', and 'Taft'.	曾在历史上真实存在的不同品种 (不一定会在园艺栽种的过程中存留下来) 包括「挑战」(Challenge)、「狄金森」(Dickinson)、「基斯特」(Kist)、「皇后」(Queen)、「雷伊」 (Rey)、「皇家」(Royal)、「无锋」(Sharpless) 和「塔夫特」(Taft)。
A stoneless avocado, marketed as a "cocktail avocado," which does not contain a pit, is available on a limited basis.	以「鸡尾酒酪梨」之名出现在市面上的无籽酪梨，目前是采限量贩售。
They are five to eight centimetres long; the whole fruit may be eaten, including the skin.	长度为五至八公分，可整颗果实连皮一起吃。
It is produced from an unpollinated blossom in which the seed does not develop.	这是由未授粉过的花苞生产而成，种子并未长出来。
Seedless avocados regularly appear on trees.	无籽酪梨经常会出现在树上。
Known in the avocado industry as "cukes", they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.	在酪梨产业中有「小胡瓜」之称，通常会因为个头太小而遭到舍弃，不会上市贩卖。
After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect in 1994, Mexico tried exporting avocados to the US.	在北美自由贸易协定 (NAFTA) 于 1994 年正式生效后，墨西哥曾试图出口酪梨到美国。
The US government resisted, claiming the trade would introduce Tephritidae fruit flies that would destroy California's crops.	美国政府当时拒绝进口，宣称该项交易会同时引进果蝇，对加州的农作物造成危害。
The Mexican government responded by inviting USDA inspectors to Mexico, but the US government declined, claiming fruit fly inspection was not feasible.	墨西哥政府做出回应，邀请美国农业部 (USDA) 指派监察员前往墨西哥，但美国政府回绝了这项请求，宣称这样的果蝇检查不切实际。
The Mexican government then proposed to sell avocados only to the northeastern US in the winter (fruit flies cannot withstand extreme cold).	墨西哥政府接着提议仅限在冬季销售酪梨至美国东北部地区 (果蝇无法熬过极度低温)。
The US government balked, but gave in when the Mexican government started erecting barriers to US corn.	美国政府悍然拒绝，但是在墨西哥政府开始对美国玉米设置壁垒后，还是让步了。
Imports from Mexico in the 2005–2006 season exceeded 130,000 metric tons (143,300 short tons; 127,900 long tons).	在 2005 年至 2006 年期间，自墨西哥进口的酪梨量超过了 130,000 公吨 (约 143,300 美吨或 127,900 英吨)。
A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.	电脑滑鼠为盈手可握的指向装置，可侦测相对于同一平面的二维动态。
This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.	一般而言，系统会将平面上的动态转译成显示萤幕上的指标动态，让图形化使用者介面得以操控流畅。
The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968.	首度公开展示以滑鼠操控电脑系统的活动于 1968 年举行。
Originally wired to a computer, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.	原本还得透过线路连接电脑，现代则有许多滑鼠可无线操控，靠着短程无线通讯与系统相互连线。
Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts.	滑鼠原本是透过一颗球体在平面上滚动来侦测动态，不过现代的滑鼠通常都是使用光学感测器，不再含有可动部件。
In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.	除了移动游标之外，电脑滑鼠还会有一个以上的按钮，可在萤幕上执行如选取选单项目等操作功能。滑鼠通常也会搭配其他元素，好比触控表面和「滚轮」，以便执行其他操控功能和其他面向的输入形式。
The earliest known publication of the term mouse as referring to a computer pointing device is in Bill English's July 1965 publication, "Computer-Aided Display Control" likely originating from its resemblance to the shape and size of a mouse, a rodent, with the cord resembling its tail.	目前已知最早公开以滑鼠指称电脑指向装置的著作为 Bill English 于 1965 年 7 月发表的「电脑辅助萤幕控制」(Computer-Aided Display Control) 实作报告，灵感可能是源自于它的形状和大小近似老鼠一般的啮齿动物，再加上有一条像尾巴似的连接线。
The plural for the small rodent is always "mice" in modern usage.	在现代语境中，这种小型啮齿类动物的复数型态都一律称为「mice」。
The plural of a computer mouse is either "mouses" or "mice" according to most dictionaries, with "mice" being more common.	根据大多数字典的说法，电脑滑鼠的复数型态可以是「mouses」或「mice」，不过有越来越多人使用「mice」。
The first recorded plural usage is "mice"; the online Oxford Dictionaries cites a 1984 use, and earlier uses include J. C. R.	首次有明文记载的复数称谓则是「mice」。线上版的牛津辞典援引了一笔 1984 年的实际用例，而更早使用的文献包括了 J. C. R.
Licklider's "The Computer as a Communication Device" of 1968.	Licklider 于 1968 年发表的「浅谈电脑通讯装置」(The Computer as a Commuication Device)。
The term computer mouses may be used informally in some cases.	或许也有人在某些情形下随意使用「电脑滑鼠」一词。
Although, the plural of mouse (small rodent) is mice, the two words have undergone a differentiation through usage.	虽然老鼠 (mouse，小型啮齿类动物) 的复数型态为「mice」，但是这两个字在用法上还是有所分歧。
The trackball, a related pointing device, was invented in 1946 by Ralph Benjamin as part of a post-World War II-era fire-control radar plotting system called Comprehensive Display System (CDS).	轨迹球 (一种与滑鼠相连的指向装置) 是在 1946 年由 Ralph Benjamin 所发明。当时是战后名为「全方位显示系统」(Comprehensive Display System) 的火力管制雷达测绘系统的一部分。
Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service.	Benjamin 当时任职于英国皇家海军的科学研究部。
Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick.	Benjamin 的计画使用了类比电脑来计算目标机接下来的位置。计算根据为使用者透过摇杆输入的几组初始定位点。
Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a "roller ball" for this purpose.	Benjamin 觉得用来输入资料的装置需要更讲究好看一些，于是为此发明了当时名为「滚轮球」(roller ball) 的装置。
The device was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built, and the device was kept as a military secret.	这项装置于 1947 年获得专利，不过当时只有打造出将一颗金属球架在两片橡皮轮圈上滚动的初始版本，而且是军事机密。
Another early trackball was built by Kenyon Taylor, a British electrical engineer working in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff.	另一款早期的轨迹球是由一位英国的电机工程师 Kenyon Taylor 与 Tom Cranston 和 Fred Longstaff 联手打造而成。
Taylor was part of the original Ferranti Canada, working on the Royal Canadian Navy's DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving) system in 1952.	Taylor 当时任职于费朗蒂公司 (Ferranti) 的加拿大分部，于 1952 年负责协助加拿大皇家海军研发 DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving，数位自动化追踪及解析) 系统。
DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin's display.	DATAR 在概念上与 Benjamin 展示出来的成品相仿。
The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions.	该款轨迹球使用四个圆盘来捕捉动态，横轴及纵轴方向各有两个。
Several rollers provided mechanical support.	此外还加上几组滚轮来让机械运作更为流畅。
When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball.	当球在滚动的时候，负责捕捉动态的圆盘会跟着旋转，于是圆盘外缘的接触点会与线路产生周期性接触，进而产生脉冲输出并记录球体的每个动作。
By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined.	透过计算脉冲次数就能判读球体的实际动向。
A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals.	有一台数位电脑会负责计算轨迹，并使用脉冲编码调制的无线电讯号将计算结果传送给舰队中的其他船舰。
This trackball used a standard Canadian five-pin bowling ball.	这款轨迹球使用的是加拿大的标准版五瓶制保龄球。
It was not patented, since it was a secret military project.	因为是军事机密，所以并未申请专利。
Douglas Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) has been credited in published books by Thierry Bardini, Paul Ceruzzi, Howard Rheingold, and several others as the inventor of the computer mouse.	史丹佛研究所 (即如今的国际史丹佛研究所，SRI International) 的 Douglas Engelbart 在 Thierry Bardini、Paul Ceruzzi、Howard Rheingold 及其他数名学者的出版著作中被称为电脑滑鼠的发明者。
Engelbart was also recognized as such in various obituary titles after his death in July 2013.	Engelbart 于 2013 年 7 月逝世之后，也曾在各种讣告消息中以发明者之姿受到表扬。
By 1963, Engelbart had already established a research lab at SRI, the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), to pursue his objective of developing both hardware and software computer technology to "augment" human intelligence.	1963 年，Engelbart 此时已经在 SRI 建立了扩展研究中心 (Augmentation Research Center，简称 ARC)，借此追求他同时发展电脑硬体及软体技术以「扩展」人类智慧的目标。
That November, while attending a conference on computer graphics in Reno, Nevada, Engelbart began to ponder how to adapt the underlying principles of the planimeter to X-Y coordinate input.	那一年的 11 月，Engelbart 在参加于内华达州雷诺市举行的电脑图像学研讨会时，开始思考着如何让求积仪的基本原理得以套用在以 X-Y 轴为基础的座标输入上。
On November 14, 1963, he first recorded his thoughts in his personal notebook about something he initially called a "bug," which in a "3-point" form could have a "drop point and 2 orthogonal wheels." He wrote that the "bug" would be "easier" and "more natural" to use, and unlike a stylus, it would stay still when let go, which meant it would be "much better for coordination with the keyboard."	1963 年 11 月 14 日，他首先在自己的笔记本中记下了自己的想法。他一开始将其称为「虫」，采「3 点接触」形式，包括「1 个定位落点和 2 个相互垂直的滚轮」。在他的笔下，他认为这个「虫」使用起来会「更轻松」且「更自然」，而且它不同于一般的记录探针，只要一放开手，它就会静止不动，这代表它能够「与键盘更加合作无间」。
In 1964, Bill English joined ARC, where he helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype.	1964 年，Bill English 加入了 ARC，协助 Engelbart 打造出第一个滑鼠原型。
They christened the device the mouse as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail, and in turn resembled the common mouse.	他们将这个装置命名为「滑鼠」，因为早期的模型会在装置尾端接上一条线，看起来就像条尾巴，倒转过来看就如同一般常见的老鼠。
As noted above, this "mouse" was first mentioned in print in a July 1965 report, on which English was the lead author.	如前文所述，「滑鼠」一词首次出现在于 1965 年 7 月发表的一份报告中，English 为该报告的第一作者。
On 9 December 1968, Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would come to be known as The Mother of All Demos.	1968 年 12 月 9 日，Engelbart 公开演示了这款滑鼠的操作方法，后人誉此为「演示活动之母」(The Mother of All Demos)。
Engelbart never received any royalties for it, as his employer SRI held the patent, which expired before the mouse became widely used in personal computers.	因为该款滑鼠的专利权归属 SRI 所有，所以 Engelbart 从未以此收到任何一分版税。待专利过期之后，滑鼠才开始广泛运用在个人电脑上。
In any event, the invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart's much larger project of augmenting human intellect.	无论如何，发明滑鼠也就只是 Engelbart 扩展人类智慧的雄心壮志中的一小段插曲。
Several other experimental pointing-devices developed for Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS) exploited different body movements – for example, head-mounted devices attached to the chin or nose – but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience.	之后也有人参照 Engelbart 的联线系统 (oN-Line System，简称 NLS)，利用不同的身体动作研发出其他实验性的指向装置 (例如连结到脸颊或鼻子的头戴式装置)，但最后滑鼠还是以其速度和便利性取胜。
The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two potentiometers perpendicular to each other and connected to wheels: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis.	第一款滑鼠是个相当笨重的装置 (如图所示)，使用了两组相互垂直且接上滚轮的电位计：每个滚轮都会各自沿着一道轴线转动。
At the time of the "Mother of All Demos", Engelbart's group had been using their second generation, 3-button mouse for about a year.	在进行「演示活动之母」的时候，Engelbart 的团队已经使用了第二代的三键式滑鼠将近一整年了。
On October 2, 1968, a mouse device named Rollkugel (German for "rolling ball") was described as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal was developed by the German company Telefunken.	据文献记载，德国的德律风根公司 (Telefunken) 曾于 1968 年 10 月 2 日针对其 SIG-100 终端机研发出名为 Rollkugel (即德文的「滚轮球」) 的滑鼠装置。
As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball.	不同于 Engelbart 的滑鼠，德律风根的滑鼠装置可谓「鼠如其名」，真的有一颗球在里面。
It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named Rollkugel) that was embedded into radar flight control desks.	这是以嵌在雷达飞行控制台内且形似轨迹球的装置为基础 (该装置也叫做 Rollkugel)。
This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken Konstanz for the German Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung (Federal Air Traffic Control) as part of their TR 86 process computer system with its SIG 100-86 vector graphics terminal.	这款轨迹球是在 Rainer Mallebrein 的率领下，由德律风根公司康士坦兹分部的团队为德国联邦航管局 (Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung) 研发出来的装置，为其 TR 86 电脑处理系统和 SIG 100-86 向量式图像终端机的一部分。
When the development for the Telefunken main frame TR 440 began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team came up with the idea of "reversing" the existing Rollkugel into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device.	当德律风根公司于 1965 年开始研发其 TR 440 主机时，Mallebrein 和他的团队灵机一动，将现有的 Rollkugel「反转过来」变成如老鼠般的可动式装置，让客户不用再为早期轨迹球装置上的诸多安装孔感到烦躁。
Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968.	在结合了光笔和轨迹球之后，从 1968 年开始成为他们的系统输入选用装置。
Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum.	有些滑鼠于 1972 年安装在慕尼黑的莱布尼兹超级计算中心 (Leibniz-Rechenzentrum) 内，至今仍完好保存在博物馆中。
Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.	不过德律风根公司认为这项发明还没重要到值得为此申请专利。
The Xerox Alto was one of the first computers designed for individual use in 1973 and is regarded as the first modern computer to utilize a mouse.	于 1973 年问世的 Xerox Alto 是最早开始专为个人使用所设计的其中一款电脑，也被认为是第一款运用滑鼠操控的现代化电脑。
Inspired by PARC's Alto, the Lilith, a computer which had been developed by a team around Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zürich between 1978 and 1980, provided a mouse as well.	在帕罗奥多研究中心 (PARC) 推出的 Alto 电脑启发之下，由苏黎世联邦理工学院 (ETH Zürich) 的 Niklaus Wirth 团队于 1978 年至 1980 年间研发出的 Lilith 电脑也提供了滑鼠装置。
The third marketed version of an integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the Xerox 8010 Star in 1981.	第三个整合了滑鼠装置与电脑系统，且做为个人电脑上市贩售的是于 1981 年问世的 Xerox 8010 Star。
By 1982, the Xerox 8010 was probably the best-known computer with a mouse.	到了 1982 年，Xerox 8010 可说是当时最知名的有滑鼠的电脑。
The Sun-1 also came with a mouse, and the forthcoming Apple Lisa was rumored to use one, but the peripheral remained obscure; Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold lab mice.	后来的 Sun-1 电脑也附有滑鼠，当时也曾一度谣传说即将推出的苹果 Lisa 电脑有使用滑鼠，但结果其周边装置还是鲜为人知。经营「滑鼠之家」(The Mouse House) 的 Jack Hawley 曾在报导中表示，有一位来自大公司的买家一开始还认为他在贩卖实验小鼠。
Hawley, who manufactured mice for Xerox, stated that "Practically, I have the market all to myself right now"; a Hawley mouse cost $415.	Hawley 负责为全录公司制造滑鼠，曾宣称「我几乎可说是独霸当今的滑鼠市场」。当年 Hawley 滑鼠的单价为 415 美元。
In 1982, Logitech introduced the P4 Mouse at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, its first hardware mouse.	1982 年，罗技公司 (Logitech) 在拉斯维加斯的 Comdex 贸易展上正式推出 P4 滑鼠，为旗下第一款硬体滑鼠。
That same year Microsoft made the decision to make the MS-DOS program Microsoft Word mouse-compatible, and developed the first PC-compatible mouse.	同年，微软公司 (Microsoft) 决定让 MS-DOS 系统的 Microsoft Word 程式能够与滑鼠相容，并研发出第一款能与个人电脑相容的滑鼠。
Microsoft's mouse shipped in 1983, thus beginning the Microsoft Hardware division of the company.	微软的滑鼠于 1983 正式出货销售，其硬体部门也就此开始正式营运。
However, the mouse remained relatively obscure until the appearance of the Macintosh 128K (which included an updated version of the Lisa Mouse) in 1984, and of the Amiga 1000 and the Atari ST in 1985.	然而，此时的滑鼠依然未受到重视，直到 Macintosh 128K 型电脑 (内含更新版的 Lisa 滑鼠) 以及 Amiga 1000 型和 Atari ST 型电脑分别于 1984 年和 1985 年出现，才开始受人注目。
Other uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains.	滑鼠的输入功能也时常在特殊的应用领域中出现其他用途。
In interactive three-dimensional graphics, the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects' or camera's orientation.	在互动式 3D 图像中，系统通常会将滑鼠的动作直接转译为虚拟物件或镜头的方向变动。
For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's "head" faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head.	例如，在使用第一人称视角的射击游戏中 (请见下图)，玩家通常会运用滑鼠来控制虚拟玩家角色的「头」要往哪边看：滑鼠往上移，玩家就会往上看，萤幕上则会出现玩家头上的景象。
A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined.	相关功能也能让物件图像旋转，进而检视每一个面向。
3D design and animation software often modally chords many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect.	3D 设计和动画软体经常会透过程式协调许多不同的动向组合，让物件和镜头得以藉由几个滑鼠能够侦测到的轴向运动来进行旋转，或是在空间中移动。
When mice have more than one button, the software may assign different functions to each button.	若所使用的滑鼠有一个以上的按键，则软体可以分配不同的功能给每一个按键。
Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item.	通常来说，滑鼠的主要按键 (大多是以右撇子为配置的滑鼠左键) 是用来选取项目，次要按键 (大多是右撇子配置的滑鼠右键) 则是用来开启可套用在该项目上的其他动作选单。
For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.	例如，若使用具有一个以上按键的滑鼠平台，Mozilla 网页浏览器会在使用者点击主要按键之后追踪到所选取的连结，接着在点击次要按键后跳出快捷选单，选单上有适用于该连结的各项动作。点击第三 (中央) 滑鼠按键则通常会让浏览器另开新分页或新视窗。
Optical mice rely entirely on one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics.	光学滑鼠全靠一组或多组发光二极体 (LED) 以及能感测影像的光电二极体阵列来侦测相对于滑鼠垫面的动作方向，不再使用机械滑鼠的内建可动部件。
A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (laser) light.	雷射滑鼠为使用同调 (雷射) 光的光学滑鼠。
The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone.	最早出现的光学滑鼠得在预先印制好的滑鼠垫面上侦测动作，现代的 LED 光学滑鼠则能够大多数不透明的漫反射表面上操作。这类滑鼠通常无法在像抛光岩面般的镜射表面上侦测动作。
Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces.	雷射二极体也会用来增进解析度和精准度，改善在不透明的镜射表面上的效能表现。
Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.	使用电池的无线光学滑鼠会为了节省电力让 LED 光源不停闪烁，只有在侦测到动作时才会稳定发亮。
Often called "air mice" since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other accelerometer (US Patent 4787051) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported.	体感滑鼠 (inertial mouse) 因为不需在平面上操作，通常会被称作是「空中飞鼠」。这类滑鼠会使用类似音叉的装置或是其他加速度感测器 (美国专利序号 4787051) 来侦测所有支援轴线上的旋转动作。
The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation.	最常见的款式 (由罗技公司和 Gyration 公司生产制造) 具有两个面向的旋转自由度，并且不会受空间平移所影响。
The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or "gorilla arm".	使用者只要稍微转一下手腕就能移动游标，减轻其疲劳感或避免出现「猩猩臂膀」(gorilla arm)。
Usually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position.	体感滑鼠通常为无线操作，并设有可在使用过程中关闭动作侦测的开关，让使用者可以自由摆动而不用担心会影响到游标定位。
A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use.	有一份体感滑鼠的专利声明中提到该款滑鼠所消耗的电力比光学滑鼠还要少，而且具有更高的灵敏度、重量更轻，使用起来更方便。
In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.	结合了无线键盘的体感滑鼠能够提供不同以往的人体工学配置，不再需要平滑的工作表面，并可望减轻某些因工作姿势不良而经年累月产生的伤害。
Also known as bats, flying mice, or wands, these devices generally function through ultrasound and provide at least three degrees of freedom.	也有人称呼这类装置为「蝙蝠」、「空中飞鼠」或「魔杖」，一般均可透过超音波进行功能操作，并提供至少三种面向的自由度。
Probably the best known example would be 3Dconnexion ("Logitech's SpaceMouse") from the early 1990s.	最广为人知的例子大概会是从 1990 年代早期推出的一系列 3Dconnexion 装置 (如「罗技公司的太空滑鼠」)。
In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse.	Kantek 公司于 1990 年代末推出了 3D 戒指滑鼠。
This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons.	这款无线滑鼠为可戴在手指上的指环装置，能够以拇指点击上面的三个按键。
The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.	滑鼠的基站会追踪滑鼠在三维空间中的移动轨迹。
Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.	尽管颇具吸引力，但最后还是因为无法提供充足的解决方案而黯然退场。
One example of a 2000s consumer 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote.	2000 年后其中一个进入消费市场的 3D 指向装置范例，就是 Wii 遥控手把 (Wii Remote)。
While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation).	Wii 遥控手把的主要用途为动态感测装置 (也就是说，它能够判读自身的方位和移动方向)，也能透过使用内建的红外线镜头来比较红外线发射器的光线位置和距离，侦测出自身的空间定位 (因为 Nunchuk 控制器配件并未装设镜头，所以仅能得知自身目前的方向和方位)。
The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar.	这款产品最大的缺点在于它只有在自身镜头可以看见条状感测器时，才能判读出空间座标。
More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system.	后来消费市场中出现了定位更精准的装置，包括 PlayStation Move 动态控制器、Razer Hydra 体感控制器，以及 HTC Vive 虚拟实境系统的专属控制手把。
All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.	这些装置都能在三维空间中精准侦测出自身定位及方向，无论自身与感测站之间的相对角度有多大。
A mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped.	有个与滑鼠相关的控制器名为 SpaceBall，在工作表面上方设置了一颗能够轻松让人抓握的球体。
With spring-loaded centering, it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes, in both directions for each.	球体内部装了弹簧，能够传送球体平移以及一共六个方向轴的角度移位动态资讯，每个方向都一视同仁。
In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse.	2010 年 11 月，一间名为 Axsotic 的德国公司推出了新款 3D 概念滑鼠，取名为 3D 球形滑鼠。
This new concept of a true six degree-of-freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations.	这款全新的概念滑鼠为真正具有六面向自由度的输入装置，使用了一颗能够无拘无束进行三轴滚动的球体。
In 2000, Logitech introduced a "tactile mouse" that contained a small actuator to make the mouse vibrate.	2000 年，罗技公司推出「触觉滑鼠」，内含一组能让滑鼠震动的小型致动器。
Such a mouse can augment user-interfaces with haptic feedback, such as giving feedback when crossing a window boundary.	这款滑鼠能透过触觉回馈增强使用者介面体验，比如在跨越窗框边界时给予相应的回馈感受。
To surf by touch requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness; this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice but never marketed.	若要透过触碰来感受冲浪，使用者必须能够感受到海浪的深度或强度。第一款电流变触觉滑鼠曾经实现了这项功能，却从未在市场上贩售。
Tablet digitizers are sometimes used with accessories called pucks, devices which rely on absolute positioning, but can be configured for sufficiently mouse-like relative tracking that they are sometimes marketed as mice.	平板电脑数位转换器有时会和名为「定位盘」(puck) 的配件一起使用。这是需要绝对定位的装置，但也可以配置几乎跟滑鼠一模一样的相对追踪定位功能，有时会当成滑鼠在市面上贩售。
As the name suggests, this type of mouse is intended to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries.	鼠如其名，这一类滑鼠致力于提供最佳的体感舒适度，以及避免发生腕隧道症候群 (carpal tunnel syndrome)、关节炎 (arthritis) 和因为反覆拉扯而造成的伤害。
It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.	其设计以符合自然的手部姿态和动作为要点，借此减轻不适感。
