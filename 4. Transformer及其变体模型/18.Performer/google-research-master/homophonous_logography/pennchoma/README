Implementation of Penn & Choma's correlation measure.
-----------------------------------------------------
The script run.sh gives examples of usage. The results of one run of
that script, averaged over the 5 runs for each case are as follows:

Summed absolute correlations:
     	        Document is 1 chapter    	  Document is 6 chapters
Chinese                          5828                              14859
3-gram English                   6386                              15116
Korean                           8508                              18200

Mean number of characters per document:
     	        Document is 1 chapter    	  Document is 6 chapters
Chinese                           782                               4674
3-gram English                   1110                               6635
Korean                           1118                               6686

Korean has higher overall numbers but it also has fewer distinct
characters, meaning that more characters have a better chance of
cooccurring in any document:

Number of distinct characters:

Chinese                          3177
3-gram English                   3194
Korean                           1249

That is, 3-gram English and Chinese are pretty well matched for
character types, whereas Korean has about a third, yielding the result
we see.

Between document size and the number of characters, all of Penn &
Choma's differences can be explained.
