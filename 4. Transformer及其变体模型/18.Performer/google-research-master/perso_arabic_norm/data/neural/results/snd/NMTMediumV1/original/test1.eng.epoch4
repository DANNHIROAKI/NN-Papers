God is merciful and merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Judgment
You worship Thee, and we will help you.
Guide us to a straight path.
The path of those whom You have bestowed, not of those who have evoked anger, nor of those who went astray.
Alif-Lam.
This Book is the Book in which there is no doubt, and the guidance of Allah is a straight path.
Those who believe in the unseen, and establish the prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
And those who believe in that which has been sent down to you and that which was sent down before you, and they are in the Hereafter.
These are the guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.
Verily, those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearts, and their eyes is darkened, and theirs is a great punishment.
Among men are some who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," but they are not believers.
They wish to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive themselves, and they do not understand.
Their hearts is a disease in their hearts, but Allah has increased their disease, and theirs is a painful punishment for them.
And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption in the land, they say, 'We are only reformers."
Verily, they are the ones who do not understand, and they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people believe," they say, "Shall we believe as the fools believe?" But they do not know.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when they are alone with their devils, they say, "We are with you; we are only mocking."
Allah will punish them, and they will wander in their insolence in their insolence.
Those are they who have purchased error in error, so their profit will not profit them, nor will they be guided.
Their likeness is like the likeness of a one who kindled a fire, and when it was kindled around him, their light turned away from them, and they saw them in darkness.
deaf, dumb, dumb, and deaf, they will not return.
Or as it is like the sky, the darkness of darkness, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, and lightning, in their ears, they put their fingers in their ears, and Allah encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning is like their eyes, when it covers them, then when it covers them, then when they turn their backs, then they will turn their eyes, and if Allah wills, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their eyes, then Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those who were before you so that you may be righteous.
He Who has made the earth a resting place for you and the sky, and the sky, and the sky, and the sky, and brought forth therewith fruits from your sustenance, so that you should not be set up to Allah.
“And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to Our Servant (Muhammad), then produce a surah like it, and call your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful.”
And if you will never be able to see the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, theirs will be Gardens of Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall say, "This is what we have given us." They will say, "This is what we have given us." They will have their spouses, and they will abide therein forever. They shall abide therein forever.
Allah does not like a parable of a gnat or a gnat, but those who believe will be able to know that their Lord is the Truth. But those who disbelieve say, "This is what is with Allah." But those who disbelieve will say, "This is what Allah has misled many. He has strayed many astray. He has not strayed many of them."
Those who break the covenant of Allah after it has become clear to him, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the land, they are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will cause you to die, and again you will be returned.
It is He Who has created for you all that is in the earth, then He has made the heavens to fall into the sky, and He has made the seven heavens, and He is the Knower of all things.
And when your Lord said to the angels, "I am going to place a vicegerent in the earth," they said, "Shall we place it in a place, and shed blood and shed blood, and we celebrate Your praise?" He said, "I know that you do not know."
And He taught Adam all the names, then He showed them the angels and said to them: "Tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-Knower, the All-wise."
He said, “O Adam, inform them, how many of them said, “Did I not tell you of their names?” He said, “I know that I know the heavens and the earth, and I know what you do, and I know what you do.”
And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate Adam before Adam," he refused, but he refused to rebel in him, and he refused to disbelieve.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thy wife in Paradise and thy wife in the Garden, and eat of what you desire, and do not approach this tree, lest you are unjust.
Then Satan made it clear to them, and they were in it in it, and We said to them, "Get you," and We said to you, 'Get you, you are enemies, and a provision for your Lord."
Then Adam received from his Lord words of inspiration; then his Lord turned towards him; surely He is the Oft-returning, the Merciful.
We said, "Go down from all of you; then if there comes to you a guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve."
But those who disbelieve and deny Our Signs, they shall be the inmates of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill my covenant with Me, and I will fulfill your covenant with you, and fear Me not.
And believe in what is with you, confirming what is with you, and do not reject the first of it, and do not sell My verses for a small price; and fear Me alone.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth.
And give up the prayer, and pay the poor, and bow up in the ranks of those who bow down.
Do you enjoin people to do good deeds, and do you forget the Book, while you read the Book? Will you not then understand?
And seek assistance in patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult for those who humble their hearts.
Those who think that they are their Lord, and to Him they shall return.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I made you excel the earth.
And guard on the Day when no soul shall avail another, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall they be helped.
And remember We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, when We delivered you with a severe torment, and your sons and your daughters, and therein was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We made the sea for you, then We saved you and drowned Pharaoh and drowned the people of Pharaoh.
And (remember) when We appointed for Moses forty nights, then you took him a calf, and you were unjust to the wrong-doers.
Then We forgave you, so that you may be grateful.
And (remember) when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, that you may be guided.
And remember when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed your people have wronged you, so turn your back to your Lord, and kill him. He is the best of your souls. He is the Most Merciful, the Merciful."
And when you said, O Musa, we will not believe in you until we see God, until you see the thunderbolt, while you see.
Then We raised you after your death, so that you may be grateful.
And We shaded you with clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails and said, "Eat of what We have provided you, and do not wrong Us."
And (remember) when We said: Enter ye town in this town, and eat therefrom, and enter in the gate, and enter the gate in the gate, and say: "Our sins, we shall forgive your sins, and do good for them."
But those who were unjust to the wrong-doers said to them, "We have sent down the punishment of the heavens, so that We should send down upon them a punishment from the sky."
And (remember) when Musa prayed for water for his people, We said: Strike your staff with its staff; and every tribe gushed forth from twelve springs, and every tribe gushed out of its drinking; and We said: Eat not from Allah, and do not act corruptly in the land.
And when they said, "O Moses, we will not be patient with food for your Lord, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and its cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle, and their cattle."
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good, shall have their reward with their Lord, and there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
And when We took a covenant with you and raised you above the Mount, We said: Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, and remember that which is therein.
Then you turned away after you turned away from Allah and His mercy and mercy, you would certainly have been lost.
And you know those of you who transgressed in the Sabbath, so We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and hated."
So We made it a sign for them, and a admonition for them, and a admonition for those who guard.
And when Moses said to his people, "Allah commands you to slaughter a cow." They said, "Are you mocking us?" He said, "I am the one who is the Most High of Allah."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make it clear for us." He said, "This is what is a cow old." He said, "This is not a cow nor a old woman."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make it clear to us." He said, "This is a yellow cow." He said, "This is a yellow cow."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make it clear to us, and make it plain to us, for it is the same for us. If Allah wills, we will surely be guided."
He said: "Allah says: "This is not a cow, nor a cow, nor any one of the fields, nor the fields, nor the fields." They said, "When it came to pass, it will not be raised up, and they will not have been decided."
And when ye slew a man, then disputed, and disputed in the matter, and Allah is clear to what you do.
Then We said, "Strike the flesh of his own soul, so that Allah gives life to you, and He shows you His Signs, so that you may understand."
Then after your hearts, your hearts are hardened, though they are worse, even though they are covered from it, and there are some of them who are watered with water, and there are some of them who are with them, and some of them shall be cast away from Allah; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Have you ever believed that you will be Muslims, when there are a party of them who hear the Word of Allah, then after it has come to them, then they will have knowledge of Allah, and then after that, they will have knowledge.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when they meet each other, they say, "Do you tell them what Allah has revealed to you?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?
And among them are the Book who do not know the Book, but they do not know the Book, but they only follow it.
So woe to them that which is in the Book of their Book, and they will say, "This is from Allah," so that they may have a small price for them, and for their deeds they have earned what they have earned.
And they say, "The Fire will not touch us for a few days." Say, "Have you taken a covenant with God?" Say, "Have you taken a promise from Allah?" And Allah will not break His promise.
Indeed, those who have earned their sin and their souls will be the inmates of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.
As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, they shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein forever.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: Worship none but Allah, and your parents, and your parents, and the orphans, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the prayer, and give up the prayer, and give up the prayer.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you (saying): "Do not shed your blood, nor drive your backs from your people, and bring you back from your homes, then you are witnesses."
Then you will turn away from your people, and the people of his people will be a party of them; and some of them shall be a party of them, and some of them shall be with them, and they shall not be able to draw away from them. And if they come to you, they will not be able to remove them from their own souls; and if you have come to them, they will not be able to remove their punishment in this world, and the punishment of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
These are the ones who have bought the world in this world, so that their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And We gave Moses the Book, and We sent him after him, and We gave Jesus the son of Mary, and We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit, and We strengthened him with the spirit, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit, and some of them were arrogant.
And they say, "Our hearts are wrapped in their hearts, but Allah has cursed them, so that they may believe."
And when the Book of Allah is revealed to them, it is a matter of truth, and when they ask the meeting of the disbelievers, they will not be able to help those who disbelieve, but they will be the curse of the unbelievers.
Evil is that which Allah has sent down upon them, because they are not going to believe in it, because Allah wishes to give His servants to whom He pleases, so that they should have incurred wrath against them, and the unbelievers shall have a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what has been sent down to us." But if it is true to them, it is the truth which is with them. Say, "What is the matter of Allah?" Say, "What is the matter of Allah?"
Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, but you took the calf after you, and you were unjust.
And when We took a covenant with you, and raised you above the Mount, We said: Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen to them, and they said, "We do not believe," and their hearts disbelieved in their hearts. Say: "What is the matter of your faith?"
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is with you, then for the exclusion of the Hereafter, then if you are truthful, then you will surely die."
But they will not be able to ask for what their hands have earned, and Allah knows the unjust.
And they will surely be able to be more than the people of the people and the idolaters, and all of them are more than a thousand years; each of them will be a thousand years, and he will not be able to save him from the punishment of Allah. And Allah sees what they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is an enemy to the enemy of Allah (i.e. the Qur'an), that He has sent down to your heart (the Qur'an) in your heart (the Qur'an), and the Truth (i.e. the Qur'an), and the guidance (i.e. the Qur'an) before it, and the guidance and glad tidings for the believers.
Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His angels and Gabriel and Michael and Michael, surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.
And indeed We have sent down to you clear signs, and none will deny them.
And when they do not believe, it is a party of them who believe, but most of them do not believe.
And when a Messenger came to them from Allah, confirming what is in the Book of the Book, a party of them threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, if they do not know.
And they follow the footsteps of those who follow the footsteps of the devil, and the devil, and the people of the devils, and the people of the people of the world, and the people who were in the midst of the earth, and the people who were in the midst of the angels, were not in the midst of the angels; and they had no share with him; and they had no share with their own accord, but they had not been given a share with him.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, they would have a better reward from Allah; if they had known, they would certainly be able to know.
O you who believe! do not say, "The Qur'an is not equal to us." Say, "Be not deceived," and say, "This is a painful punishment."
The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) are not among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians), nor of the polytheists (polytheists, polytheists, polytheists, polytheists, polytheists, etc.) from your Lord (Muhammad), except that He may send you down from your Lord. And Allah chooses whom He pleases, and Allah is the Owner of Bounty.
Whatever We abrogate in oblivion or oblivion, We bring some of it a better, or We bring it better for you, and you do not know that Allah has power over all things.
Do you not know that the kingdom of Allah is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and that you have no protector or helper?
Ask what you ask to ask for your Messenger. Why did you ask the faith of Moses? But whoever disbelieves in the truth, he goes astray from it.
Many of the People of the Book wish that they would turn away from you after you have believed in your hearts, so that they may have the truth in their hearts, after the truth has become clear to them. So forgive and overlook, Allah will send His command to His command; surely Allah has power over all things.
And keep up the prayer and pay the dues and pay the dues for your own souls, and you will find it with your own souls; surely Allah sees what you do.
And they say: "None is the Jews, unless they enter the Garden or the Garden," they are their own souls, and they say, "This is the truth, if you are truthful."
Nay, whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and is a doer of good, he shall have his reward with his Lord, and there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians are the Christians," and the Christians say, "The Jews are not in the Book." But they have been given the Book in the Book. They say, "Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection." He will judge between them concerning the Day of Resurrection.
And who is more unjust than he who is in the name of Allah's name, and strives for their own ruin, and strive for their own ruin? But they shall not enter in fear of their fear; this is in disgrace in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.
To Allah belongs the East and the West; and if you turn back, you will be the Face of Allah; surely Allah is All-embracing, All-knowing.
And they say: "Allah has taken a son." Glory be to Him! Glory be to Him in the heavens and in the earth, and all that is in the earth.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decrees it, He says, "Be!" and it is.
And those who do not know will say, "Why does Allah not speak to us?" They say, "Why does not a sign come to us?" They say, "These are their hearts." Verily, We have explained the signs for a people who believe.
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) as a bringer of glad tidings as a bringer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be able to ask the Fire.
And the Jews will not be able to stand with them, nor will they follow the Christians until they follow your religion. Say: "Allah is the Guide of the guidance, and has knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge." If you follow their desires, then you will not find any protector from Allah, nor will you find any help.
Those to whom We have given the Book (i.e. the Qur'an), in order to recite it (i.e. the Qur'an) in order to recite it (i.e. the Qur'an), they believe in it, and they do not believe in it.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you in the land.
And fear the Day when there shall be no fear of each soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor will they be helped.

And when We made the House for a place for men and a place for the House, We made it a place for Abraham, and Abraham, Abraham, Abraham, Abraham, and Jacob, and Ishmael, and Ishmael, and those who bow down and prostrate themselves.

And remember Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House, saying: Our Lord, accept this from us; surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing.
Our Lord, make us submissive to Him, and make our offspring a nation from among Thee, and make us submissive to Thee, and forgive Thee, for Thou art the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Our Lord, send among them a Messenger from among themselves who will recite their Signs to them, and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And who is the one who follows the religion of Abraham, except for him, in this world, and in this world, in this world, and in the hereafter, in this world, and in the hereafter?
When his Lord said to his Lord, “I submit to the Lord of the worlds.”
And Abraham instructed the sons of Jacob (Abraham), and the children of Ibrahim (Abraham), saying: "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you the religion, so do not die except as Muslims."
Have you not considered the children of Mary when he died, he said to his children, "I shall worship you, and you, your God, and the God of your fathers, and Ishmael, and Ishmael, and Ishmael, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and the God of Isaac?"
This is the people who have passed away from what they have earned, and you will not be asked for what they have earned, and you will not be asked of what they used to do.
“And they say, ‘Be Jews or Christians,’ and you will be guided, say, ‘We follow the religion of Abraham,” and he was not of the idolaters.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "We believe in Allah, and that which has been sent down to us, and that which We have sent down to Abraham, and the Tribes, and the Tribes, and the Tribes, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the messengers, and all that is in the Book of the Prophets."
If you believe in what they believe, then they are guided; but if they turn away, they are in schism; then Allah will suffice you against them; and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Allah is the one who is the best one, and who is better than Allah? And we are our worshippers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you dispute with us concerning Allah, seeing that He is our Lord, and your Lord, your Lord, and your deeds, and your deeds, and your deeds?"
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob, and the Tribes, and the Christians, or the Christians, or the Christians? Say: "Are you aware of Allah? Allah is not aware of what you do."
This is a people who have passed away from what they have earned, and you will not be questioned for what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they have earned.
The people of the people will say, "What has their hearts turned away from them?" Say, "He is the God of the East and the West, and He guides whom He wills. He guides whom He wills."
And thus We have made you a good nation, so that you may be witnesses over mankind, and the Messenger is a witness over you, and the Messenger is a witness over you, and that you may be a witness against those who have gone before you. And whoever is not in the way of Allah, he turns away from their heels, and turns away from their heels. Allah is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
We see your eyes from the sky, so We will surely turn you to a qiblah, and you will turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and you will turn your backs on your faces, and you will surely know that their Lord is the Truth of their Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what they do.
And if the Book had been given the Book, you would not follow your vain desires, nor will they be able to follow your qiblah, nor will they be able to follow their own desires. If the knowledge of the knowledge has come to you, then you will surely be among the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We gave the Book in the Book, they recognize their children, but most of them know the truth, and most of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of the doubters.
And every one is a one who turns back to him, and then do good, then you will be in the end of Allah; surely Allah will bring you together; surely Allah has power over all things.
And wherever you turn away from the Sacred Mosque, turn away from the Sacred Mosque, and it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn away from your face, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your backs on the Sacred Mosque, and turn your backs on them, and do not fear them; and do not fear them, and do not fear them, so that I may complete My favor on you, so that you may be guided.
Similarly, We have sent among you a Messenger from among yourselves, reciting to you Our verses and purifying you, and teaching you the Book and the wisdom, and teaching you that which you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me, and be grateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek help in patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the patient.
“And say not to those who are killed in Allah’s way, they are dead, nay, they are alive, but you do not perceive.
And We shall certainly test you with fear and hunger, and in their wealth, and in their lives, and in their lives, and give glad tidings to those who give glad tidings.
Those who, when disaster befalls them, say, "We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return."
Those are those on whom are mercy from their Lord and mercy, and those who are rightly guided.
Indeed, the Safa and the Marwah are in the signs of Allah (i.e. the Qur'an), and those who are in the House (i.e. the Ka'bah in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), then whoever spends the House (i.e. the House of Allah), or do not find a share between them, let them not be able to change them; surely Allah is Ever-Knowing, All-Knowing.
Those who follow the Signs and the guidance, We have sent down to them the Book which We have sent down to them in the Book, and the curse of Allah will curse them.
Except those who repent and amend, and make amends, then I will turn to them, and I am the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
As for those who disbelieve and disbelieve while they are disbelievers, Allah will curse them in the curse of the angels and of all mankind.
They shall abide therein forever, nor shall they be given respite, nor shall they be reprieved.
And your God is God, there is no god but He, the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth and the earth, and the night, and the night, and the night, and the night, and the night, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, in the earth, and the earth in the earth; and in the earth there are signs in the earth.
Among men are those who worship others with Allah. They love those who believe in Allah, and those who believe in Allah, and those who believe in Allah, they will see that they shall see the punishment of Allah. And if they see that they will see that they shall see the punishment, and Allah is severe in punishment.
And when those who followed those who follow the truth will see the punishment, and they will see the punishment, and their ties will be gathered.
And those who went astray will say, "If we return to us, we would certainly have gone away from them, but if they have been taken away from us, they would not be able to destroy them."
O men, eat of what is in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil.
He has made you evil and shameful deeds, and that you do not know what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has sent down," they say: "We follow what we found our fathers." But their fathers knew their fathers, and they did not follow the right path.

O you who have believed, eat of the things of Allah which We have provided for you, and give thanks to Allah if you are (all) Him.
It is not lawful for you to eat, and the flesh, and blood, and blood, and blood, and the flesh of swine, who has no more than the limits of Allah, and if he is forced, he is not able to forgive him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah has sent down the Book of what they have sent down in the Book, and they have a small price of their bellies; and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them.
They are those who have gone astray in error, in error, and for forgiveness, for they are the Fire of Hell.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) in the Book, and the Book (of the Book) in the Book (the Qur'an) in the Book, in a great deviation.
It is not for you to be the east and the west, nor to the west, nor to the west, and the good, and the good, and the angels, and the angels, and the Prophets, and the prophets, and the Prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the Prophets, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor.
O you who believe, you are the enemy of the believers, in the matter of the enemy, and a woman who has a wife behind her husband, and she is a woman who is a wife of his brother, and he is a slave of his brother; and whoever is in the right hand, he will give it to his brother. This is a mercy from your Lord. This is a painful punishment from your Lord.
O mankind, there is a life for you in this life, so that you may be righteous.
And when he approaches you of death, he will give you wealth, and for his parents, for his parents, and for the good of kin, this is the duty for the pious.
But whoever alters it after he has heard it, it shall be the punishment of sin; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
But whoever is guilty of ignorance or transgression, then if he is unjust, then there is no sin for him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
“O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was decreed for those before you, so that you may be pious.”
The number of a number of days is the day, and if you are sick, it will be for you, and for those who are in the Day of Resurrection, and those who do not love it, it will be better for him. And whoever does good, it will be better for him; and if you are wise, it is better for you.

And when the angels said: O Mary, Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds.
Mary, be obedient to your Lord, and bow down and bow down with those who bow down.
This is the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, and you were not with them when they cast lots with arrows, and when they were pens, they should not be able to be with them, nor wast thou with them when they disputed.
When the angels said, “O Mary, Allah gives you good tidings of a Word from Him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, held in this world and the hereafter, and one of those who are near.”
He will speak to his people in the cradle and in his cradle, and he shall be one of the righteous.
He said, "My Lord, how can I have a son when I have no soul, when he said, 'He will not have a son," and then He said, "He is the one who creates it?" He said, "This is the matter."
And He will teach him the Book and the Wisdom and the Gospel and the Gospel.
And We sent the Children of Israel to the Children of Israel, and he said, "I have sent a sign from you from your Lord, so that I may be like you as a grain of mustard seed, and it may be like the flesh of the flesh." And if you are in your minds, you will have the power of Allah, and He will make you die in your dwellings, and you will be in your minds.
And I am the first confirming that which is before me, and that which has been forbidden to you, and that you have come to you with a sign from your Lord, and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah, and follow Me.
Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path.
And when Jesus saw their eyes, he said: "Is the helpers of Allah?" The disciples said, "We are the helpers of God." They said, "We believe in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims."
Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast sent down, and we follow the Messenger, so write us down among the witnesses.
And they plotted, and Allah planned, and Allah is the best of planners.
And when Allah said, “O Jesus, I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection will be superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. To Me shall be your return, and I will judge between you concerning that wherein you differed.
As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they shall have no helpers.
And those who believe and do good deeds, He will pay them their rewards, and Allah does not love the unjust.
This is what We recite to you (O Muhammad SAW) in this Qur'an and the Book of Wisdom.
“The likeness of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, ‘Be” and he was.”
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.
And those who dispute with you with knowledge after you come to you, say, "We shall be your sons, and your sons, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and we will be the curse of the liars."
This is the truth; there is no god but Allah; and Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
But if they turn away, Allah knows the mischief.
“Say: “O People of the Book! come to common terms between us that is between us, and between us: that we worship none but Allah, that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah.”
O People of the Book! dispute ye not in the Book, when ye dispute in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, so that ye may not understand?
Verily, you are the ones who dispute about what you have knowledge, but you dispute about what you have no knowledge, and you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian, but he was a upright man, and he was not of the idolaters.
The people of Abraham (Abraham), those who follow him, and those who followed him, and the Messenger and the believers, and Allah is the Protector of those who believe.
A party of the People of the Book wish that they would lead you astray, but they misled themselves not, but they are not aware.
O People of the Book, why do you not believe in Allah's signs, while you are witnesses?
O People of the Book, why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and conceal the truth and conceal the truth?
And among the People of the Book among the People of the Book said: "Believe in the morning in the morning, and in the day that He has sent down, that they may turn away in the morning, and that they may turn away."
And do not believe in one who follows your religion, and say, "The guidance of Allah is upon you," and they say, "If you do not believe, you will be like those who have been given you." Say: "Whatever is in the hands of Allah, He will give it to whom He pleases, and Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
He whom He wills whom He pleases; and Allah is the Owner of Bounty.
And of the People of the Book there is some of the People of the Book, and if you have any portion of them, it will not be for you, and some of them will not be able to do it. That is because they say, "There is no blame on us." They say, "There is no blame on us."
Verily, whoever fulfills his pledge and fears Allah, then verily, Allah loves those who fear Him.
Those who sell their covenant with Allah and their oaths for a small price, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them the day of the Hereafter, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful punishment.
Among them there are some of them who read the Book with their tongues, so that it may be a Book, so that it may not be a Book, and they say, "This is from Allah," and they say, "This is from Allah," and they do not know it.
It is not for any human being that Allah has sent down to him the Book and the wisdom and the Prophethood, then he will say to mankind, "Be my friends," and he said, "I have submitted the Book of Allah, and that which is written in the Book."
And the angels and the prophets will not obey your Lord. If you have believed, then He will make you successors.
And when Allah took a covenant with the Children of Israel, that I gave you the Book and Wisdom, then after a Messenger come to you with what is with you, confirming him, and you will not believe in him, and you will help him.
But whoever turns away after this, it is the transgressors.
“And who is more seeking than those who seek the religion of Allah, and in the earth and in the earth, willingly or unwillingly, willingly or unwillingly?
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "We believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to us, and that which We have sent down to Abraham, Ishmael and Jacob, and Jacob, and Jacob, and Jacob, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the messengers, and the messengers, and the messengers, and the messengers of their Lord, We shall not differentiate between them."
And whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How will Allah guide a people who have disbelieved after their belief, then they bear witness that the Messenger has come to them, and clear proofs came to them? Allah does not guide the unjust people.
These are the ones who are on the curse of Allah, the angels, the angels, and all mankind.
They shall abide therein forever, nor shall they be given respite, nor shall they be reprieved.
Except those who repent thereafter and reform; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who disbelieved after their belief, then increase their disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted, and they are the losers.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the earth will not be accepted from them, and if they have not accepted it, it will not be accepted from him. They shall have a painful chastisement, and they shall have no helpers.
You will not attain righteousness unless you spend the love of what you love, and whatever you spend, then Allah knows what you do.
The food of the Children of Israel has been made lawful for the Children of Israel that which is unlawful for you. Say, "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
And whoever forges a lie against Allah, they are the wrongdoers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham, the sane, and he was not of the idolaters."
Indeed, the first House (the first House), the first House for mankind (the first), was at the appointed time, and a guidance and a guidance for mankind.
There are clear signs in this Qur'an, and whoever enters it, and whoever enters it, it is Allah's House; and for the pilgrimage of the House, there is a place for the people of the House; and whoever disbelieves in it, then surely Allah is Independent of all things.
Say, “O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, while Allah is with you that you do not believe?”
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you avert the way of Allah's way, seeking the way of the way of the people, seeking it, and that you are not aware of it?"
O you who have believed, if the People of the Book had been given a party of you, then they would turn you back to the believers after you have believed.
And how can you disbelieve in that which Allah has rehearsed to you, and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW) is in your Messenger, and whoever is in Allah's leave, He will surely guide him to a straight path?
O you who have believed, fear Allah, that he should be feared, and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast in the rope of Allah, and do not be divided with each other, and remember the favour of Allah's favour, and remember your hearts in your hearts. He has made your hearts in your hearts, and you will be saved in your hearts. And you will be saved from the Fire, and you will be saved. Thus Allah makes clear His signs to you that you may be guided.
And among you there shall be a party of you who invite good deeds, and enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong, and they are the successful.
And be not like those who are divided into sects, and after the clear signs came after them, they shall have a great punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be turned away from their faces, and will be said to those whose faces will be black: "Did you reject your faith after you have disbelieved?"
And those whose faces are whitened will be admitted to the mercy of Allah; they will abide therein forever.
These are the Signs of Allah, which We recite to you in truth, and Allah does not desire any injustice to the unjust.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and to Allah is the final return.
You are the best of men who are good in the best manner, and enjoin what is right, and forbid what is right, and those who believe in Allah and the Book, if they believe, it would have been better for them, and most of them are believers.
They will not be able to harm you, but if you are attacked, they will turn their backs against you, and they will not be helped.
They shall be in a place of God's leave, except for the people, and they will have a share against God, and they will have their wrath, and they shall have their own anger, and they shall have a curse against Allah. That is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah, and the prophets and the prophets. That is because they were unjust.
They are not all alike, but the People of the Book are a party of the People of the Book, who recite the verses of Allah in the night and in the evening.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong, and forbid those who do good deeds, and they shall be among the righteous.
And those who do good deeds will not be denied, but Allah knows the pious.
As for those who disbelieve, their wealth will avail them from their possessions, and they will be the inmates of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever. They shall abide therein forever.
Those who spend in the life of this world is like a likeness of the likeness of a people who have wronged their own souls, and a people who have wronged themselves, and it will be destroyed, and they will not be wronged.
O you who believe! take not your friends for friends besides others, but they will not be able to harm you in your own lusts; they are their friends, but their mouths is hardened, and what their breasts conceal in their breasts is greater than their mouths; surely We have made clear to you the communications.
You are the ones who love them, and you will not be able to love those who believe in you, and they will say, "We believe in the Book." They will say, "We believe." Say, "Die in your rage." Say, "Die!" Say, "Die in your rage." Say, "Die!"
If good befalls you, it grieves them; but if you are ill of evil befalls you, they will rejoice in it, and if you are patient, their plot will not avail you. Allah encompasses what they do.
(Remember) when you entered your family in the morning to enter the believers in their place, and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
“When two parties came against you, they wanted to help Allah, and the believers have believed in Allah.
And Allah had helped you at Badr when you were weak; so fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
(Remember) when you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels?"
If you are patient, and you are patient, and they will come with you, your Lord will help you with five thousand thousand angels.
And Allah made it as a example for you, so that your hearts may be your hearts, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
That He may cut off a part of the unbelievers, or expose them in infamy, so that they may turn away.
"There is no one in you (O Muhammad SAW), but He will punish them, or punish them."
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He pleases; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not devour usury, doubled, doubled, doubled, and fear Allah.
And fear the Fire which is prepared for those who disbelieve, for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, that you may be shown mercy.
“And march forth for forgiveness from your Lord and for a Garden whose width is as the width of the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.”
Those who spend in prosperity in prosperity and in adversity, anger and anger, and pardon men, and Allah loves the doers of good.
And those who, when they commit a indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives sins except Allah?
The reward of their Lord is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and how excellent is the reward of those who work (in Paradise).
Indeed, many of you have passed away before you, so travel in the land and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a declaration for mankind, a guidance and a admonition for the pious.
And do not grieve, nor grieve, nor grieve, if you are true, if you are believers.
If a wound has befallen you, they have a wound like a wound, and that they may make a lie between men, and that Allah may know those who believe and be witnesses of you; and Allah does not love the unjust.
And so that Allah may give the believers to believe, and make the unbelievers a lie.
Do you think that you will enter Paradise in the Garden, and you will not enter the limits of Allah, nor who are patient of those who are patient?
And indeed you have already met for death before you met, so that you might see it, and you will see it.
And the Messenger is not a apostle; but if a apostle has passed away from him, then if he dies, he will not turn back on your heels, and if he turns back to his heels, he will not be able to be able to be able to harm Allah; and Allah will reward those who are grateful.
And he will not die except for the term of Allah, except for a appointed term; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him the reward of this world, and We shall give him the reward of the Hereafter, and We shall reward him for the reward of the Hereafter.
And many of the prophets were fought with many of them in the way of Allah, and they did not become weak in the way of Allah, nor did they not weaken themselves, nor did they weaken themselves, nor did they not grieve.
They said, "Our Lord, our Lord, forgive us our sins, and make our deeds firm, and make us firm, and give us victory over the disbelieving people."
God will reward them in this world and in the Hereafter, and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who have believed, if you obey the unbelievers, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will turn back losers.
Indeed Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve in the hearts of Allah, for that which He has sent down to them, and their abode is the Fire: their abode is hell, and evil is the evil-doers.
Allah has promised you the promise of your promise, but when they had transgressed with him, they slew him with him, and disputed in you, and disputed in you, and you disputed in the truth, so that you may be saved from what He pleases, and He will make you successors in the hereafter, and you will be saved. And Allah will forgive you in the hereafter; and Allah is the Owner of the believers.
And when you had turned away, he was not calling up, and the Messenger came to you, and the Messenger cried to you, so that you might not grieve, and that you might not grieve for what you have earned, and that which you did not grieve, then Allah is aware of what you do.
Then He made a calf for you. He sent a party of you a party of you, and a party of them said, "What is the matter for us?" They said, "This is for us." They said, "This is what we have done." They said, "This is what is in your homes." Say, "This is what Allah has sent down in your hearts, and that which is in your hearts." Say, "This is what is in your hearts." Say, "This is what is in your hearts." Say, "This is what is in your hearts." And Allah knows what is in your hearts. And Allah knows what is in your hearts.
Indeed, those who turned away on the day when the two armies came to pass to you, then Satan made some of them to slip in some of them, but Allah forgave them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when their brethren came to pass in the land, and when they were in the earth, they would not have died, or they would say, "If they had been gone to us, they would not have died, and die, and die, and Allah will die."
And if you are killed or die in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah is far better than all that they amass.
And if you die or die, then you will be gathered to God.
So it is the mercy of Allah that you deal with them gently, and if you were rough hearted, you would certainly have dispersed from your dispersed; so pardon them, and ask them for forgiveness. So when you have decided in your trust, then put your trust in Allah. Verily, Allah loves those who trust. Allah loves those who love.
If Allah helps you, there is no god but He. If He forsakes you, then if He forsakes you, then He will help you, and who is the believers in Allah.
It is not for a prophet who does not betray him, nor will he grieve, and the Day of Resurrection will be paid for what he has earned, and every soul will be paid for what he has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah's pleasure like him who rejects him from Allah's wrath, whose abode is Hell, and an evil destination?
They are in the presence of Allah, and Allah sees what they do.
Allah conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, rehearsing to them His verses, sanctifying them, and instructing them in the Book and Wisdom, and teaching them in the Book and Wisdom.
And when a calamity befalls you, it was a double thing for you, and you said, "What is this?" Say, "This is from your own." Verily, Allah has power over all things.
And on the day when the two armies met in the sight of Allah, that he might make it known to you, and that He might know the believers.
And the hypocrites (hypocrites) said to the hypocrites, "Come to fight in the way of Allah." They said, "If we had stayed, we would certainly have been given you." They said, "If we had stayed in this, we would certainly have been given you." But they say, "This is the day of Allah. Allah knows what is in their hearts. And Allah knows what they do."
They say to their brethren, "If they had been told, they would not have been killed." Say, "If you are truthful, you would not have died."
“And reckon not those who are killed in Allah’s way as dead, nay, they are alive in their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them, and they do not have any share with those who are behind them, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the Bounty of Allah and His Bounty, and Allah does not reward the believers.
Those who responded to Allah and the Messenger after him, and those of them who are righteous, and those who are righteous, shall have a great reward.
Those who said to the people, "Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them," but it increased their faith, and they said: "Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs."
So they returned to Allah's grace and did not have touched them, nor did they rejoice in the way of Allah; and Allah is the Owner of Grace.
It is only Satan that suggests to you friends, so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And grieve not for those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), for those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), they will not be able to harm Allah; Allah will not give them in this world: for them is a great punishment in this world, and theirs is a great punishment.
Those who purchase disbelief in disbelief will not harm Allah; for them is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that their respite is for them; We give them respite for their sins, so that they may increase their sins, and they shall have a humiliating punishment.
It is not Allah who gives the believers to the believers, but you do not know what is good for you; and Allah does not know what He will, and Allah chooses His messengers to whom He pleases, and Allah chooses His messengers to whom He pleases; and Allah is a great reward.
And do not deem what Allah has bestowed upon them of His Bounty, that it may be better for them; it is they who are the best of them, and that they will be their patron on the Day of Resurrection, on the Day of Resurrection, on the Day of Resurrection, on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah is the All-Aware of what you do.
Verily, Allah has heard those who say: "Allah is the Most High," and they are rich, and we have said, "We have sent down their deeds and the prophets," and We will say, "Taste the punishment of the Fire."
This is because of what your hands have forwarded, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say, "Allah has promised a covenant with him." Say, "We have never believed in any messenger until he comes to us." Say, "Messengers before you have come to me before the messengers." Say, "Did you kill them, if you are truthful?"
But if they reject you, they were Messengers before you, who came with clear arguments, with clear arguments, and the Book, and the Book of Enlightenment.
Every soul shall have a taste of death, and you will not be paid your reward on the Day of Resurrection, and the Fire will be admitted to him in the Garden, and it will be admitted to him, and this is the life of the world, and this is the life of the world.
You shall surely be tested in your wealth and your deeds, and you will surely hear the Book of the Book and those who have been given the Book before you; and if you are patient, then fear Allah, and you will surely be of the cautious.
And when Allah took a covenant with the People of the Book, that He may not make it plain to you, and it will not be revealed to them, and it will be that they went away from their backs, so that they may go away from their backs, and it is a little price for them.
Do not think that those who rejoice in their own deeds will rejoice, and those who do not believe in what they have earned, and they will not be able to give them a painful punishment, and they shall have a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is All-Powerful, All-Powerful.
The creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and night and day, are signs for people who understand.
Those who remember Allah, standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and they say, "Our Lord, You have not created this aimlessly, so protect us from the punishment of the Fire."
Our Lord, You admit the Fire to enter the Fire, and to the wrong-doers, and the wrong-doers will not find any helpers.
O our Lord! we have heard the call of the call of the call of the call of the call of the call, so that we may believe in your Lord, so that we may have believed in your Lord, and forgive us from evil, and deliver us from evil.
Our Lord! Grant us what Thou hast promised us by Your Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection, for Thou art not the tryst.
So their Lord said to them, "I do not like among you, or for your wife, or your wife, or not for you, and for you there are some of you, and in your homes, and in my homes, and in the way of my homes, and in the cause of my homes, I will surely forgive their sins, and I will admit them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and that which is in the place of Allah shall be theirs."
Do not let the unbelievers go in the land in the land.
This is a brief enjoyment, and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.
But for those who fear their Lord, there are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide therein for ever; and Allah is the best of those who do good.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and that which He has sent down to you, and that they have not a small price in Allah's communications; they have not a small price for their Lord. They are their reward with their Lord; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! be patient in patience, and be steadfast, and be steadfast, and fear Allah that you may prosper.
O mankind, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single soul, and from it He created you from his mate and from many men and women and women and women and women; and fear Allah, and be careful of your relations. Lo! Allah is sufficient over you.
And give the orphans their property in their property, and do not have a good deed, but do not eat their property with their property. Lo! He is a great sin.
And if you fear that you will not be able to marry the orphan, if you marry your wives, then you have two wives, and four of you, or you will not be able to do justice; or if you fear you, you will not be able to do justice.
And give the women their dowries for their marriage, but if they are given you, then give it to you, so that you may be pleased with it.
And do not eat of what Allah has provided for you (O Muhammad SAW), and that which He has produced for you, and from them, and clothe them therewith, and speak them to them with a word.
And marry the women of the marriage, until they are given them, then if they are in them, then give them their wealth, and if they do not eat it, they shall not be afraid of them; and if they do good, they shall be in the least of it; and if they do good, then let it be for him; and whoever is good for his wealth, then let them be a witness against them; and Allah is sufficient for him.
There is a share for his parents and his parents, and for their parents, and their wives, and their wives, and their wives, or the women, or a little more-little.
And when the relatives and the needy and the needy, and the needy, give them good of them, and speak to them a word, speak to them.
And let them fear that they should take their children behind them, they will fear them, and let them be afraid of Allah; and if they speak to them, they will have their fear.
Those who eat the wealth of the orphans, in their bellies, in their bellies, in their bellies, in their bellies, and in the Fire, they will find it to enter in hell.
Allah loves your sons for your sons, for their wives, and their wives, and their wives, and the women of their wives; and if they have two sons, he is more than the two of them; and if they are pregnant, it shall be better for him; and if they do not take a child, he shall have a share for him; and if he is a child, he shall have a share for him; and if he is a child, he shall have a share for him.
And whoever has made your wives to marry your wives, then if you have a child, then if they have taken a child, then he would have given you a son, and if you have not taken a child, then he will have a share for them. And if you have not taken a child, then there is a share for them. And if you do not have any child, they will not be able to have a share for them; and if you have a child, then they will have no share for what you have given. And if you are a child, they will not be able to be able to be a child; and if you are a child or a child, then there is a share for them.
These are the limits of Allah; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide therein, and that is the supreme achievement.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will admit him to the Fire, to abide therein forever, and he shall have a humiliating punishment.
And if any of your women are guilty of lewdness, then bring four witnesses from among them, then if they bear witness, then confine them in their houses, or Allah will guide them for a straight path.
And two of you who are guilty of indecency, then if they repent, then if they repent, then turn away from them; surely Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.
Allah accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance, and then repent in their sins; then Allah will turn to them in repentance; and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.
And the repentance of those who do not do evil will be forgiven by what they do, and when death comes to them, he says, "I repent," nor for those who disbelieve, We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
O you who believe! make not your wives for women, for they will not be able to be able to be able to do their own, nor do they have any excuse in their own. So let them be a example of them, then let them go away from them. If they do not do it, it is not lawful for you. Allah is good for them.
And if you wish to take a wife for a woman, you will have a share of them, and you will have no portion of what you have earned, and you will not return to it, and you will have a clear loss.
And you have made some of you, but you have made a covenant with you, and you have made a covenant with them.
And marry not your fathers whom your fathers married, except what has passed before them; indeed it is shameful, shameful, and evil.

And for your wives is your hands, which your hands possess, and it is for you that Allah has ordained for you that which is not lawful for you.

The Jews say, "We are the sons of Allah and the Christians." Say, "What is the matter of your Lord?" Say, "What is the punishment of your sins? You have created the human beings whom He has created, and whom He pleases, and whom He pleases, and whomever He wills, He will punish whom He pleases. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and to Him is the final return."
O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you with a clear time, after the interval of the apostles after you have come to you, lest you should say, "There is no bringer of good tidings to come to us, nor a warner, and a warner, and a warner, and Allah has power over all things."
And remember when Moses said to his people: O my people! remember Allah's favour upon you when He appointed among you prophets and made you possessors, and gave you what He had not given to the worlds.
O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you, and do not turn away from your backs, nor turn your backs.
They said, "O Moses, indeed there is a great nation, and we will not enter it until they go away from it. But if they depart from it, we will surely enter it."
The two of those who fear Allah, they said: "Assault them in the gate, when you enter them, then you will be victorious, and if you have believed in Allah, you will surely be victorious."
They said, "O Moses, we will not enter it in it, but they will remain therein therein; and your Lord, if they are in it, let your Lord go."
He said, "My Lord, I have no power over my brother, and my brother, and the people of the people of the people.
He said: "This is the number of years for forty years, but in the earth they will wander in their midst; so do not be the people of the ungodly."
And recite to them the story of the two sons of Adam, so that they might offer a sacrifice for each other, and the one of each other was accepted from him. And he said, "I will kill you," and said, "You shall surely die."
And if you stretch my hand to kill me, I will not stretch my hand to kill you with your hand; surely I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Verily, I intend to give you my sin as your sin, and your sin, and you will be among the inmates of the Fire; and the unjust shall be the recompense of the unjust."
Then his soul slew him, so he slew him, and he became one of the losers.
Then Allah sent down a rain in the earth, so that he might show him his brother in the land, and he said, "Woe to me! I will surely be like the like of my brother." Then he turned away from his brother, then he repented, then he repented.
We have decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul for his own soul, or in the earth, and in the earth, it is as if he slew all mankind, as if he had saved him, he would surely be like all mankind; but indeed, Our apostles came to them with clear proofs, but indeed, after them came clear proofs, surely many of them are transgressors.
“The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.”
Except those who repent before you repent, then know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek a means of nearness to Him, and strive in His way that you may prosper.
Verily, those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), all that is in the earth, and all that is in the earth, it will ransom them from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, and it will not be accepted from them, and they shall have a painful punishment.
They wish to go out of the Fire, but they will not go forth from it, and they shall have a lasting punishment.
As for the thief, and the woman, and cut off the hands of their hands, their hands shall be punished from their hands, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
But whoever repents after his crime, then repents, then Allah will turn to him in repentance; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do you not realize that Allah is the kingship of the heavens and the earth? He forgiveth whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases; and Allah has power over all things.
O Messenger of the Prophet! Do not grieve for those who disbelieve in their hearts, because of their mouths they say, "We believe," and their hearts do not believe, and their hearts will not be accepted, and they will not be able to say, "This is not for the Jews." They will not be able to say, "This is what you wish to do." They will say, "This is not for Allah." They will say, "This is not for Allah." They will say, "This is not for this world."
And those who deny the truth, they are niggardly, then if they come to you, then leave them between them, and turn away from them, and turn away from them, if they turn their backs between them, then judge between them in justice; surely Allah loves the doers of good.
And how will they ask you to judge with you, when it is written in the Book of Allah, then it is the matter of Allah, then they are not believers?
Indeed, We have sent down the Book in this Qur'an, and the light, and the light, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and those who were given the Book of Allah, and they were not witnesses of the Book of Allah. So do not fear them, but do not fear Me; but do not fear Me, but do not sell My communications.
And We have ordained for them in this life, a eye for a eye, a nose for a nose for a nose for a nose for a tooth for a tooth for a tooth for a tooth, and for a tooth for a tooth, and for a tooth for a tooth, and for him is a tooth for him. And whoever does not judge what Allah has sent down to him, they shall be the wrongdoers.
And We sent in their footsteps Jesus, son of Mary, confirming what was before him, and We gave him the Gospel, and We gave him the Gospel and a light, confirming the Torah, and a light, and a admonition for those who fear.
And the People of the Book will judge in what Allah has sent down, and those who do not judge in what Allah has sent down, they are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) the Book (the Qur'an) in the Book (the Qur'an), confirming the Book (the Qur'an) which was before the Book before it, and a witness over them, so that Allah may judge between them, and do not follow their desires of their own desires, so that you may not follow their desires of their own desires; and if you do not follow their desires, then you will be brought back to Allah.
And let them judge in what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their desires desires to follow them from some of what Allah has sent down to you. But if they turn away, then know that Allah will punish them from their sins. And if they turn away, then know that Allah is the most unjust of people.
Why do they seek the command of the command of Allah, and that is better than the people who are in the Book?
O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends for friends; and whoever amongst you takes them for friends, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease, they will say, "We fear lest we should be afraid." But if it comes to Allah, they will say, "We fear that which is in the hearts of Allah, and that they may be in their hearts."
And those who believe will say, "Are these the ones who swore by Allah by their strongest oaths?" They will have their own souls, and they will have their own souls.
O you who believe! whoever turns away from his religion, then Allah will bring forth a people for whom He will love them, and they will love those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve in the cause of Allah, do not fear the censure of Allah, and do not fear the blame of his sin. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
Your guardian is only Allah and His Apostle, and those who are faithful to Him, and those who establish the prayer, and pay the poor, and those who bow (in prayer).
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and the believers to be friends, then surely Allah is the party of the believers.
“O you who believe! make not those who have been given the Book before you (O Muhammad SAW) and those who were given your religion (i.e. the religion of the Book), and those who were given your religion, and do not take the unbelievers for their religion, so that you are believers.
And when you call (to prayer), they (the prayer) will be called (to the prayer), and they (the prayer) are in jest, and they are not people who understand.
Say, "O People of the Book! do you blame me with no other reason than us, that we believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us, and that which has been sent down before us, and that most of you are transgressors?"
Say: "Shall I tell you more than that which is worse for you from Allah?" They will be those whom Allah has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those who are astray, are worse, and strayed from the straight path.
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe," but when they are going to come to it, they will surely be in their midst, and Allah knows best what they do.
And many of you see many of them in sin and in aggression, and in their eating, they will be in their bellies, and evil is that which they do.
Do Allah forbid the rabbis and their rabbis, and forbid their wealth, and do not forbid what they do?
The Jews say, "Allah has touched the hands of their hands." They will be their hands, their hands, their hands, and they will not be able to kill each other in their own hands; but if they are in their own hands, they will not be able to kill each other in their hands; and if the Lord has sent down the fire, He will make them clean in the land and make mischief in the land. And Allah does not love those who do mischief. God loves the mischief.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would certainly have removed their sins and admitted them into Gardens of bliss.
And if they had been given the Torah and the Gospel and the Gospel, they would certainly have taken their hands from above them, and from beneath their feet, and from beneath beneath beneath beneath beneath beneath their feet. And most of them are evil.
O Messenger, deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and if you do not do it, you will not be sent to His Message; and Allah will protect you from the people; surely Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
Say, "O People of the Book! no one can stand on you unless you stand on the truth, nor the Gospel, and the Gospel, nor do the Gospel, nor do it come down to you from your Lord.
“Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.”
We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We sent to them messengers, but when a messenger came to them, they would not desire their own desires, but they slew some of them, and they slew each other.
And they thought that they would not be tested, but they became blind; then Allah turned away from them, and many of them became blind, and many of them became blind; and Allah sees what they do.
Those who say, “The Messiah, the son of Mary, is God’s son,” Jesus said, “O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.”
Those who say, "Allah is the one who is the Messenger," they say, "There is no god but Allah." But if they do not desist, then the unbelievers will have a painful punishment.
Will they not turn away from Allah, and seek for His forgiveness? God is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a apostle; indeed, before him was a apostle, and his mother gave him the truth, and his mother gave food to eat; so see how We make the communications clear.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which has no power to benefit you, nor do you have any benefit from Allah? And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Say, "exceed the bounds of the Book beyond the bounds beyond the bounds beyond the bounds beyond the truth, trespassing beyond the bounds of the truth, trespassing beyond the people who went astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray gone astray."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David, Jesus, son of Mary, and the son of Mary.
They did not forbid each other of what they used to do.
You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve, because they have sent their souls before them, that they may have their wrath in Allah's wrath, and they will abide in it forever.
And if they had believed in Allah and the Messenger and that which was sent down to him, they would not have taken them friends, but most of them are transgressors.
You are the Jews of the people of the Jews (Jews) and the polytheists (polytheists and Christians) in the company of the believers, and you will see those who say, "We are Christians," and those who say, "We are Christians." That is because they are among them, and they are not proud.
And when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the truth, and they say, "Our Lord, we believe, so write us down among the witnesses."
How is it that we have been sent down to Allah and the truth that has come to us, so that our Lord may make us enter into the company of the righteous?
So Allah has promised for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow, beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide therein, and that is the reward of the righteous.
But those who disbelieve and deny Our Signs, they are the inmates of the Fire.
O you who believe! do not exceed the good things of Allah, making it lawful for you, nor do not exceed the limits; surely Allah loves not transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has bestowed on you, and eat of what you have been given, and fear Allah.
Allah has sworn to you in your oaths, and you will not be able to leave you for your own hands, and if you are in their houses, you will not be able to feed your houses, and if you are pregnant, they will not be able to feed you from your houses; and if you do not take a oath, they will have their houses, and you shall be grateful.
O ye who believe! intoxicants and gambling, and idols and divining arrows and divining arrows, are Satan's handiwork, so avoid them, so that you may prosper.
It is only the desire of Satan who desires the desire of wine and gambling, and in the midst of the flesh, and from the remembrance of Allah and the remembrance of your prayer. Will you not then abstain?
And obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and if you turn away, then know that our duty is only to convey the message of the Messenger.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, they shall not be able to eat their sin, and those who believe, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, they shall have their duty to Allah, and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! Allah will be with you in your hands, or your hands, and you will know that He knows that which is in your hands, and that he may know that which is in your hands, then that he may be a painful punishment.
O you who believe! Do not eat in the land, nor do you eat of what you have earned. He who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a one who is a man who is a one who is a one who is a person who is a person who is a person who is a enemy, or that he may be a place for you, or that he may be a prison for him? And Allah is the Mighty, the Mighty.
It has been lawful for you in the sea, and it has been lawful for you, and for you for a provision and a provision for you, and you are forbidden for the pilgrimage of the land. And fear Allah, you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'an for the Ka'ba (Ka'ba), the Sacred House, the Sacred House, the Sacred Mosque, and the Sacred Mosque and the moon and the moon, so that you may know that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth, and Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger is only to convey the message of the Messenger, and Allah knows what you conceal and what you conceal.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "It is not good for the good, and the good, and the good, but the weight of the abundance of the abundance of evil, so that you may be successful."
O you who believe! do not ask about what is true to you, if the truth has become clear to you, if you have been sent away, then if you ask about it, then you will have been sent down to Allah. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
A people before you asked questions, and they rejected him.
Allah has not forbidden a animal, nor a <unk>, nor a Wasilah, nor a Wasilah, nor a lie, but the lie of Allah; but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we found our fathers.” But their fathers knew not, nor did they guide the guidance.
O you who have believed, take your own souls in your own souls. If you are guided, you will not turn away from your own desires. To Allah is your return, then He will inform you of what you did.
O you who believe, when you die, some of you die, then some of you are a party of you, and some of you are among you; if you are in the land, then if you are in the land, then if you are in the land, then if you are in the land, then you will be in the land. If they are in doubt, they will not be able to say, "By Allah, we shall not be able to do anything."
But if they knew that they are one of the other, then they are one of the two of them, and they shall swear to the other, and they shall swear to Allah, that they should swear by their testimony, and they shall not be able to bear the truth, but we shall not be among the wrongdoers.
That is nearer to them that they may be truthful, or their oaths should be made by their oaths, and fear Allah, and Allah does not guide the unjust. Allah does not guide the unjust people.
On the Day when Allah will gather all the messengers, He will say to them, "What did you have done?" They will say, "We have no knowledge. You are the Knower of the unseen."
And when Jesus, son of Mary, said, "My father, I will give you a favor, and my mother, and my mother, and I will give you the love of a people in this city and in the midst of the people." And when you read the Book, it will be in the midst of the earth and the Gospel, and I will make it clear to you, and I will make it clear to you, and it will be said to them, "This is nothing but the truth of my Lord." And when the Book of the Children of Israel have come to pass, then it is not clear to them.
And (remember) when I inspired the disciples, in order to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: We believe, and bear witness that we are Muslims.
“And remember when the disciples said, “O Jesus son of Mary, is your Lord sent down to us from heaven?”
They said, "We wish that it may be for it, and your hearts, and your hearts, and we know that we are the truth, and that we may be witnesses."
Jesus, son of Mary, said: O Lord, our Lord, send down to us a table in heaven, that we may send down heaven in heaven, and shall be the first of us; for this is a sign for Thee, and for us, for Thou art the Best of providers.
Allah said: "I am going to send down to you (i.e. the Qur'an), and whoever follows you from among you, then I will surely punish him in the least of the earth."
When Allah said, “O Jesus son of Mary, did you say to mankind, ‘O Jesus, I am a god besides you, and my mother, and my mother, and my mother.”
I did not say to them aught except what Thou didst command me, saying: 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord, and I was a witness over them, and I was a witness over them, and when Thou didst die, Thou art the watcher over all things."
If You punish them, they are Your servants; if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say: This is the Day on the Day of Resurrection, their truthfulness will profit them, for them shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. Allah is pleased with them, and that is the supreme achievement.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in the earth, and He has power over all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the light light and light, then the unbelievers are the Lord.
He it is Who created you from clay, then decreed a term of a term, and a term for a term, then you will doubt.
And He is Allah in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what is hidden in your secret, and He knows what you do.
None of their Lord comes to them, but they turn away from it.
But the truth came to them, when it came to them, they will come to the news of what they used to ridicule.
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, how We established on the earth, and We made it firm, and We made it firm, and We made the rivers flow in the sky, and We caused them to grow in it, and We made them in a new shade?
And if We had sent down to you a Book in a book, and they touched it with their hands, the disbelievers would have said, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not an angel been sent down to him?" If We sent down to him, they would certainly have been given it, but they would not be respited.
And if We had made him a angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would have made them as a example for them.
Messengers were mocked before you, but those who mocked were mocked in what they mocked.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who denied the truth."
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "Allah is the One Who has made mercy for Himself." He will surely be able to gather you in the Day of Resurrection, who will surely be in the Day of Resurrection, but they will not believe.
And to Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing.
Say: "Shall I take refuge with Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "I am not able to give sustenance and sustenance." Say: "I have been commanded to be the first of those who believe, and do not be among the polytheists."
Say, "If I do not disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a great Day."
On the Day when he will be averted from that Day, Allah will have mercy on him, and that is the manifest achievement.
And if Allah touch you with affliction, there is no god but He; and if He touches you with good, then He has power over all things.
And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Say: "What is the matter in this world?" Say, "There is no god but Allah, and I have been sent down to you, so that it may be revealed to you, and you will not be able to say, 'There is no god but He."
Those who have given the Book (the Qur'an) to the Book (i.e. the Qur'an), they recognize their children (the Qur'an) as well as they know their children.
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah, or denies His Signs? But the unjust will not prosper.
And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, then We shall say to those who associated others with Him: "Where are your partners?"
Then they will not be able to say, "By Allah, we will not be associated with our Lord."
See how they lie against them, and they have gone astray.
There are some of them who listen to you, and We have put their hearts in their hearts, and deafness in their ears, and deafness in their ears. But if they see all signs, they would not believe in it; but if they see all that they have come to you, they will not believe.
And they turn away from it, and they turn away from it, and they do not destroy themselves, but they do not know.
And if you could see that they are driven into the Fire, they will say, "If we had been sent back, we would not deny the signs of our Lord, and we will be among the believers."
Indeed, those who had gone before them, they will see them, but if they return back to them, they would surely have been able to fall away, and they are indeed liars.
And they say, "This is nothing but the life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected."
And if you could see what they are before their Lord, He will say, "Is this not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say, "This is the punishment of your Lord."
Those who disbelieve in Allah's meeting, they are losers, until the Hour comes to them on the Day of Resurrection, they will say, "Alas for us!" They will bear their burdens their burdens, and their burdens will be their burdens.
And the life of this world is naught but amusement and amusement; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, then why do you not understand?
Verily, We know that they will not grieve you; but if you deny them, they will not be able to deny them.
Messengers were denied before you, but they denied their rejection, and they were patient with their help, and when Our help came to them, there is no god but He.
And if their turn turns away from their turn, then if you turn away from the earth, then a ladder in the sky or the sky, then bring them a sign to them; and if Allah had willed, He would have guided them all, and do not be aware of them.
Those who listen to Him will be able to hear the truth, and will be returned to God on the Day of Resurrection.
And they say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "This is the sign of Allah, but most of them do not know."
There is no creature in the earth, nor a bird flying on its wings, nor a bird flying in the midst of the Book, but We have not neglected anything in the Book, and to their Lord they shall be gathered.
And those who reject Our Signs are deaf, dumb in darkness, and in darkness, and in darkness, whom He wills, whom He wills, He placeth on the straight path.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or on the Day of Resurrection, will you call upon Allah, if you are truthful?"
Verily, He will call upon Him, and if He wills, He will remove that which you call upon Him, and you will not forget what you associate with Him.
And We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW), but We seized them with adversity and adversity, so that they might be humble.
So when Our punishment came to them, they would not be able to humble their hearts, but their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their deeds easy.
So when they forgot what they had reminded, We opened them with their gates, and when they had done what they had done, We seized them with a sudden, and lo.
So the wrong-doers has been cut off, and all praise of God, and all praise of the Lord.
Say: "Have you considered Allah, if your eyes and your eyes turn away your eyes, and set your hearts into your hearts, who will bring your hearts to you, other than Allah?"
Say: "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you suddenly or openly, will it be destroyed for the unjust people?"
And We send the Messengers to give glad tidings to the Prophet, and as a warner, and to those who believe, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
As for those who reject Our Signs, they will be punished in their punishment.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know that I do not know the unseen, nor do I say to you, 'I am an angel." Say, "I am the blind to the blind." Say: "The blind is the blind and the right is the right."
“And those who fear their Lord (i.e. the Qur'an) to their Lord (i.e. the Qur’an), they shall have no protector besides their Lord (i.e. the Qur’an), and there will be no protector besides them, and that they may be Al-Muttaqun (the pious).”
And do not turn away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening, seeking His countenance, nor do they have any share in their reckoning, nor do you have any share in their account, and you will surely be of the unjust.
And thus We have made some of them some of them, so that they may say, "Are these the ones whom Allah has bestowed upon us?"
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: "Peace be upon you, your Lord has mercy on you, so that you should change in ignorance of ignorance, and thereafter who repents and amend, then surely He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
Thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), so that it may be a clear path.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah. Say: 'I do not follow your desires, nor follow your vain desires." Indeed, I have gone astray, and I am not guided.
Say: "I am a clear proof from my Lord, and I deny you, but you are not a liar, but there is no god except Allah. This is the command of Allah. He is the best of the truth."
Say, "If you are in your homes, if you are in your homes, it would have been judged between me and you will have been judged between me."
And in Him is the keys of the unseen, and He knows what is in the earth; and He knows that which is in the earth and in the earth, and there is no leaf but He who knows it in the darkness of the earth, nor in the darkness of the earth, nor in the darkness of the earth, but it is in a clear Book.
And it is He Who takes your souls by night, and He knows what you have done in the day, then He raises you up, so that it may be a term appointed for you; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you did.
And He is the Guardian over His servants, and He sends your souls over you, when death comes to you from among you, then they will not die, nor do they grieve.
Then they will be returned to their truth to Allah, the Truth, the Truth, and He is the All-sufficient.
Say: "Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him and secretly?" Say, "If we have saved him from this, we will surely be of the thankful."
Say: "Allah delivers you from your distress and from every distress, then you associate with Him."
Say: "It is He Who delivers you from above your feet, from above your feet, or from your feet, or made some of you in sects, and We make you taste a taste of mutual violence, so that they may understand."
And your people deny it, but it is the truth. Say, "I am not a guardian."
Each of them is a appointed time, and you will soon know.
And when you see those who dispute in Our signs, then turn away from them, but if you turn away from them, they will not be able to make you forget, but you will not be among the unjust.
And those who fear Allah will not be able to have their reward, but they are not afraid.
And (as for) those who have created their religion, and play themselves, and the life of this world, and the life of this world, and the life of the world, and the remembrance of the world, and the remembrance of the world, and the remembrance of the world. And if it is not for him, they will not be able to have any protector, but they will not be able to have any protector, but it will be a drink for them.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall we call upon besides Allah that which does not benefit us, nor will he harm him, and whom Allah has guided to us, then he will turn away from their heels, and turn away from their heels, and turn away from their heels? Say: 'Allah is the Guide of the straight path."
