And those who do not believe in the way of Allah, and say: "You believe in Allah, and do not say to those who have been guided." Say: "It is Allah who knows you." Say, "It is Allah who has given you the Book, and He has power over all things."
It is He who gives His mercy to whomever He wills, and He is the Owner of Power.
And those who have been given the Book had been given to them, and if they should be given to them, they would not be able to do, and if they had been forbidden to you, they would say: "This is nothing but a witness." Say, "It is nothing but a witness for us." They know nothing but conjecture.
Except that case, and Allah loves the believers, and Allah loves the treacherous.
Those who have sold the covenant of Allah and the Last Day, and do not be slain, and if they are slain, they will not be joined by the Day of Resurrection, nor will they be able to be joined by the Day of Resurrection. For them is a painful punishment.
And among them are some who have been given the Book (i.e. the Taurat of the Book), and the Book (i.e. the Taurat of the Book) has been revealed to them, and they say: "This is what you have been sent down to you." Say, "Allah is not unaware of what you do."
It is not for him who has been given the Book of Allah, and He has sent down the Book, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the 'Say: 'This is my Lord." Say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day."
And that the angels came to them from Our signs, they would not believe in Allah, and He has sent down to you His Messenger, so that you may believe.
And when Our Messengers came to you from the Book of the Book, and said: 'Believe be to Allah, and the Messenger has been sent down to you, and that you have been commanded to come to you, and say, "We have been given to you." They said, "We have been given to you." They said, "We have been commanded to obey you."
Then if they turn away, they will be the losers.
Do they not see that Allah has created the heavens and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and all that is between them, and to Him you shall be returned.
Say: "We believe in Allah and His Messenger, and We have sent down to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and Isaac and Jacob, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the prophets, and that we may be of the believers.
And whoever does not respond to the religion of the religion of Allah, he will be no loser in the Hereafter, and he will be the losers.
It is not for those who disbelieved after Allah's revelations, and the Messenger had been sent down to them, and the Messenger had been sent down to them. And Allah does not guide the truth.
Those! they are the ones who lied in Allah and His angels, and the angels, the angels.
There will be no recompense for them, and they will not be able to escape therein.
Except those who repent and do wrong deeds, verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and did wrong deeds, then then they will not have accepted them, and they will not be accepted from their Lord.
Verily, those who disbelieve in the Oneness of the Hereafter, then will be a ransom for them, and they will be wronged in the earth, and they will not be accepted for the punishment.
It is no fault for you that you spend in the cause of Allah, and do not spend in what you spend. And Allah knows what you do.
The Children of Israel was not lawful to the Children of Israel. Say: "I have given a covenant of the Torah, and the Torah, and the Torah, and what you have been sent down to you."
Then if they invent not lie against Allah, and they are the losers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The truth has been revealed to Allah, and the religion of Abraham, the Hanif, the Hanif, and the idolater, and that they may be polytheists."
It is a blessed example which We have blessed to the people of the worlds.
The Book of the Book is clear to the people of the Book, and the House of the House of the House of the House. And whoever turns away from Allah's command, he is not for them. And whoever is no god but Allah, and to Him is the journeying.
Say: "O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah, and do not know that Allah is all in all things?"
Say: 'O People of the Book! Why do not make the way of the Book, and those who disbelieve in the way of Allah, and do not know the way of Allah. Allah knows what you do.
O you who believe! If the People of the Book had come to you, they would not believe in it, and if you turn away.
And they will not see that Allah has sent down to you, and the Messenger, and the Messenger, and the Messenger, and Allah has guided between you.
O you who believe! Fear Allah and His Messenger, and do not fear your heart, and do not be successful.
And remember Allah's way, and He has sent down to you a Messenger from the sky, and He made you successors from the sky, and He made you successors from the sky, so that you may attack you from the brink of your Lord, so that you may fear that you have been sent down to you, and that you may remember God’s revelations, so that you may be guided.
And among you are some who have been given to you, and those who do good, and those who do good, and those who do good, and those who are the prosperers.
And do you not see that the people of the Book had come to them, and they would have been wronged.
On the day when the faces will be whitened, and the faces will be turned away, and they will say: "Did you disbelieve?" Then taste the punishment, and you will be said: "Taste the punishment of the disbelievers."
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be abiders in the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the verses of Allah which We have sent down to you; and Allah does not guide the truth.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. To Him belongs all matters.
That is the matter of your own selves, and those who believe in what is best, and do not make the people of those who believe in it, and those who believe in it, and that they had been guided, they would surely have been guided.
They will not be able to harm you, but if they turn away, they would not be able to flee, and if they are attacked, they will surely be succoured.
It is no blame for them, and they will be humbled from their homes, and their hands are the ones who were behind by the sight of Allah, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the people of the Prophets.
Those who have been given the Book are divided in the Book, and those who recite the signs of Allah, and those who prostrate themselves in the night.
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and forbid what is good, and forbid what is good, and forbid those who are patient, and those who are patient.
And those who do not think that they shall not be wronged, and Allah is Knowing of all things.
Verily, those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them, nor shall they be abiders. These are the fellows of the Fire.
The likeness of the life of the life of this world is nothing but a likeness of the land, and those who have wronged themselves in the land, and Allah destroys them, and they will not be wronged.
O you who believe! Do not make your intimates to you, but they are not able to hide them, and if they have been knowledge, they would surely conceal them. And Allah knows the signs of their mouths, and they are not aware.
It is not for those who believe in Allah, and if you are pleased from them, they say, "We have been sent down to you." But if they turn away from them, they say: "We have been sent to you." Say: "Allah knows what you do."
And if they are patient, they shall be inclined to you, and if they turn away, they will not be able to harm. And if they are patient, they will surely be niggardly, and Allah knows what they do.
And (O Muhammad), when We have made you a enemy from the believers, and the believers and the believers, and Allah is the Hearer, the Knower.
And when you were divided to you that they were divided to you, and Allah was the Protector of the believers.
And Allah has made you victory for you, so that you may be thankful, and that you may be thankful.
And when the angels came to them, they said: "Why is your Lord's angels?" He said, "What is the angels?"
"If you have patience, and do good deeds, you would have been among you, and your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels."
And Allah has been sent down to you, but that you may be comforted of you, and that which is in the hearts of Allah, and Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
Verily, those who disbelieve in the way of Allah's way, they would not be seized by their homes.
You do not know whether you have no power of Allah, or whether He punish them, or they will not be wronged.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. He punishes whom He wills, and He is Forgiving, Merciful.
O ye who believe! Devour not usury, and fear that which ye have been working, and fear Allah that ye may be successful.
(O Muhammad), you will be the enemies of Hell, and the unbelievers, and the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not obey the believers.
And ask forgiveness from your Lord and your Lord's forgiveness, and the day of Power, and the day of Power.
Those who spend their wealth, and spend in the cause of Allah, and restrain their vows, and Allah loves those who do good.
And if those who commit wrong, they shall be wronged from their own souls, and they have no sin from Allah, and who will be returned with their sins. And Allah does not love the unjust.
For those who believe and do righteous deeds, they shall abide therein forever, and they will abide forever forever. That is the recompense of the righteous.
(Muhammad), tell them, before the people of the towns, and the people of the towns, and the people of the towns.
This is the Qur'an, and a guidance, and a mercy for the believers.
And do not grieve, and if you do not desist, and you will be better.
And if you had been a wound, We shall have sent forth to you, and We have sent for you the believers, and the believers, and the believers, and the believers, and the believers, and Allah loves the believers.
And that Allah may purge those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.
What is you that you have been a garden of which you have been promised to you? And those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.
And you had come to you (O Muhammad SAW) before you, and you were not like you to you, and you were not like you.
The Messenger of the Book had come to you, but that you may be questioned before you, and if you turn away before you, there is no doubt for you. And if you turn away from Allah, He will not punish you. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
There is no doubt for the day when no soul will come to him, and whoever is a soul for him, and whoever is a good deed, We shall give him the reward of this world and the Hereafter, and We shall surely give him a reward for the righteous.
The people of those who disbelieved before the people of the Book were fought to them, or they were not able to change them, nor did they weaken themselves. God loves them with their sins, and Allah loves them all.
They will say, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and we are among those who believe."
Then Allah will requite them the worst-doers and the Hereafter, and He loves the best-doers.
O you who believe! If you obey the truth, then turn away from you, then you will be losers.
That is because Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of all things.
And those who disbelieve in the way of Allah, they have no power over them, and Allah has sent down to them their heart, and they shall abide in the Fire. Such is the abode of the Fire.
Allah has promised you the truth, and that you had come to you, then that you may be among them, and that you had been among you, and that you had been among you, and that you had been among you, and that you have been given to you, you would have been better to you. And if you turn to your Lord, He will give you victory, and He is the Best of the believers.
And when you had come to you, they said, "What is your mother?" But when they had come to you, he said, "Did you not come to you? God has made you victory, and that you may be returned to God. God knows what you do.
And when He willed, they would say, "We have been forbidden to you." Say, "It is not for us." Say: "It is not for us." Say: "It is not for us." Say, "It is not for us." Say, "It is not for you that you have stayed behind." Say, "It is Allah who has created you in the land." Say, "God knows what is in the breasts of the hearts." Say, "Allah knows what you do."
On the day when they see the angels, the people of the two parties had turned away from their homes, and they will not be wronged from God. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
O ye who believe! When those who are slain in their hearts are a disease, then they are slain in their homes, and if they are slain, they would say, "Had we slain over us?" They said, "Had we slain, we would have been slain. God is aware of what you do."
And if you do not desist in the Cause of Allah, they will surely have been better for Allah, and Allah is the Best of providers.
And if you do not die, you will surely be questioned.
It is He who has delivered you from the mercy of the believers, and when they turn to them, they would have inclined to them, and consult them with their hands, and consult them with their affair. And if you turn away, they would surely have inclined to them. And Allah loves the believers.
If Allah helps you, He would remove you to you, and if He forsakes you, He would not forgive you, if you are believers.
It is not a prophet for the people of the Prophet, but whoever is no doubt in the Day of Resurrection, and he will be recompensed for the Day of Resurrection, and they shall not be wronged.
Is he who follows Allah's wrath, and whose heart is the fire of Allah's wrath, and whose abode is Hell, and a miserable destination.
They are in Allah's sight, and Allah knows what they do.
Verily Allah has bestowed for them the believers and the believers, and We gave them the Book, and the Wisdom, and the Wisdom, and the Book, and the Book, and the Illuminating Book.
And if you had come to you, he would have been among you, and if you had come to you, they would say: "What is the matter of Allah?" Say: "Allah has power over all things."
On the day when the two armies met, the two armies met by the permission of Allah, and that He might test the believers.
And those who are hypocrites, they say, "We have been forbidden to you." They said, "We have been forbidden to you." They will say, "We have been forbidden to you." They said, "We have been forbidden to you." They will say, "God knows what they did."
They said, "We have been forbidden to you," they said, "We have been forbidden to you." Say, "Had you wished, they would not have been mocking.
And do not know those who are slain in the way of Allah, or they are dead, and they are dead.
Those who rejoice in Allah and His bounty, and those who spend their wealth and their lives, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
Those who rejoice in Allah and His bounty, and fear that Allah will not be successful.
Those who believed in Allah and His Messenger, and the Messenger had been sent to them, they shall have a great reward.
The unbelievers said, "We are afraid of you." They said, "We are afraid of you." They said, "We have believed in God and His Messenger, and Allah is the Best of providers."
Then they will try to cause from Allah and His mercy, and He has made them victory from their hands. And Allah is the possessor of bounty.
It is only a man who listen to you, and do not turn away from you, if you are believers.
And do not grieve for those who disbelieve, or they have no power of Allah. And if they do not respond to them, they will have no power in the Hereafter, and they will be the losers.
Those who do not believe in the way of Allah will not be accepted for them, and they will have a painful punishment.
And do not let those who disbelieve that We have given them respite, and We have made them respite for them, and We shall have made them taste for them a shameful punishment.
It is not for Allah's command for you, and that you may be among those who believe in the Oneness of Allah, and those who do not believe in Allah and His Messenger, and those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and believe in Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah and His Noble Messenger.
And those who spend their wealth in Allah's Cause, and do not spend for them, they would not be able to hide them from the earth, and they will be in the heavens and the earth. And Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and Allah knows what you do.
Those who say: "Allah has begotten a son," they said: "We have been forbidden to Allah's name." They said, "We have been forbidden to the people of the world, and we shall be among the losers."
This is because which you have been promised before you, and Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say, "We are God's Messenger has been sent down to us." They said, "Did we not come to us from a Messenger from Allah?" They said: "Did you come to us, if you were truthful?"
And if they had come to you (Muhammad Muhammad SAW), the Messengers came to them (Muhammad SAW) before them (Muhammad SAW) before the people of the Messengers (i.e. the Messengers of the Oneness of Allah).
Every soul will be recompensed for the Day of Resurrection, and you will be recompensed for the Day of Resurrection. This is the recompense of this world and the Day of Resurrection, and the abode of the world will be recompensed. This is the recompense of the world.
It is for you that We have bestowed for you, and that which you have been related to you, and those who have been given the Book before you, and those who have been given the Book before you, they will be better than what they have done. And Allah is the Best of all things.
And when the Book of the Book had been sent down to the Book, they would have been revealed to them, and when they had been given the Book, it would be a party of them, and they would not be wronged for it, and they would not be wronged.
Do not think that those who exult in what they have done to them, and do not think that they have no power of their own hands, and they shall be a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He is All-powerful, all-powerful.
Verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the alternation of the night.
They are standing, sitting, sitting, sitting, sitting, sitting, and sitting, and they say, "Our Lord, You have created us from the heavens and the earth, and that you may be among the unbelievers."
"Our Lord! You shall gather us the Fire from the Fire, and the punishment of the Fire will be realized."

Then they will say, "Lord, I have been commanded to seduce you, and do not kill them, and do not kill them." But they will be better than them, and they will live in their homes, and they will abide in their homes. That is the gardens of which rivers flow. That is the reward of those who do good.
(Muhammad), do not warn the people of those who disbelieve,

Have you not seen those who have given the Book to whom the Book has been given, and those who disbelieve in the way of Allah?
And Allah knows best that is in the breasts of Allah. And Allah is Sufficient of all things.
They are a group of those who have been given the Book, and they say, "We have been forbidden to them." They said, "We have been forbidden to the people of the Book." They said, "We have been forbidden to the people of the Book." They will say, "We have been forbidden to the people of the Book." They will surely be wronged.
O People of the Book! We have sent down to you a Book, that you may warn those who believe in it, so that they may see them with the way of Allah, and the people of the people came to them, and that they may be returned.

Do they not see that We have created the earth, and they would not be able to do.
Or do they think that Allah has bestowed to them from His bounty, and He has given them the Book, and We gave them the Book of the Book, and We gave them the Book of the Book.
Those who have been given the Book (i.e. they.e. they.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel)).

Have you not seen those who believe in what has been sent down to you from what has been sent down to you? And those who believe in the Book had been given to them, they would surely have followed them, and Satan has made them astray.
And when it is said to them: "Come to Allah's Messenger," they say: "We believe in Allah's Messenger."
Then, when they were confronted by the punishment, they would have been returned to their Lord, and they would say, "We have been given to God, and we would not be wronged."
Those are they whose hearts are Allah's hearts, and those who do not believe in their hearts, they say, "We hear to hear."
We had sent to you a Messenger, but that they had been wronged, they would have followed them. Had Allah willed, they would have followed them. Had Allah willed, He would have forgiven them. God is All-forgiving, All-merciful.
And thy Lord will judge between them concerning the matter, and they will not judge between them, and if they had been differing, they would surely have tarried them.
And if We had willed, We would not have made them permission for them, and they would not have done to them. Had We not given them to them, they would not have been wronged. And We had made them a great reward.
And We will surely give them a great reward.
And We have guided them.
And those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, and those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.
This is the bounty of Allah, and Allah is the Best of all things.

Verily, you would be a trial for you, and when they had been returned, he would say: "I have been given to you, and I would not be among the losers."
And if Allah had pleased for you, He would say, "If I had been given to you, I would surely have been able to help me."
Do not sell those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do not die in the life of the world, and whoever fights in Allah's life, and will have a reward of the Hereafter.
And what is you to fight in the way of Allah, and the women of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the Cave, "Our Lord! Rescue us from the way of our Lord, and do not make us die."
Those who disbelieve fight in the way of Allah, and fight in the way of Allah, and fight in the way of Satan, and fight in the way of Satan. Verily, Satan is the enemy of the unbelievers.
Have you not seen those who say, "What is the matter of your Lord?" Say, "You are a enemy from the land, and those who do not believe in the land, and those who do not believe in the land, and those who do not believe in the land, and those who do not say, "Our Lord, we do not give the life of this world, and we shall not give a share of the Hereafter."
There is no fault for you. If they see them, they say, "If you are waiting." Say: "It is no fault for you." Say, "It is God's favour for you." Say, "It is a sign from Allah." In fact, they are not aware.
It is not for you who is niggardly, and We have given you a good heart, and We have sent down to you a Messenger, and a bearer of good tidings.
The Messenger of the Messenger has been sent to him, and he turns away from him, and We have sent to you the truth.
And they say, "We have been tempted to you." But when they turn away from them, they say, "This is a matter between you." But Allah is sufficient of all things.
Do they not ponder that Allah would not bring any promise to them, nor would they have been able to make them a inconsistency.
And when they had come to them, they would have come to them, and when they had been given the Book, they would have followed them, and they had been given the Book, and they would not have been guided. Had We not given them a favour from your Lord, so that He may make you a mercy from the believers, so that they may turn away.
So fight in the way of Allah, and do not make the unbelievers, and those who have been fought in the cause of Allah, and those who fight with Allah's cause. Verily Allah is the Mighty of all things.

Those of whom you have been among the people of the desert of them, and they do not go to them, and if they have been resolved, they would not be able to fight. And if they turn away from them, they would not be able to kill them, and if they had been resolved, they would not have taken them with them. And if they turn away from them, they would surely have taken them to you. And Allah loves them, and do not make them any way.
Verily, you are some of them, and if they turn away from their homes, they would not find them into their homes, and if they turn away from them, they would not find them out from their homes; and if they turn away from them, they would not be able to kill them. And if they turn away from them, they would surely have taken them to them, and We have given them a clear Book.
