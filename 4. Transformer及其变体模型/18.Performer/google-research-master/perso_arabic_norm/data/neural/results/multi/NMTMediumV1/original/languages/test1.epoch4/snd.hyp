The Beneficent, the Merciful, the Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all Being,
The Merciful, the Merciful.
On the Day of Resurrection,
It is no god but He, and we are with those who surrender.
Guide us to the Straight Path.
These are the ones who believe in the way of Allah, and do not guide them from the way.
Alif, Lam.
This is the Book. There is no doubt in it; and Allah is the Best of those who are guided.
Those who believe and do not believe in the prayer, and spend the alms, and spend for what We have provided them.
And those who believe in the Book and that which hath been sent down unto thee, and those who believe in the Hereafter, they are the best of those who believe.
These are those who follow their Lord, and are the successful.
Verily those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allah, they do not know you, or do not warn them.
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing and their ears, and their hearts is a great punishment.
And among them are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day." They will say, "This is the Day of Resurrection."
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do not deceive them, but they are not aware.
Those who conceal their hearts in Allah's cause, and their hearts are a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Do not corrupt corruption in the land, and do not say, "We are indeed reformers."
These are the ones who do not understand, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Believe in the way of Allah," they say: "Shall we believe in that which we believe?" Nay, but they know not.
When they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe," and when they meet them, they say: "We bear our fingers."
Allah mocks them, and letteth them wander blindly.
These are those who have bartered guidance from guidance, and they do not guide it, nor are they guided.
The likeness of those who disbelieve in a fire is a fire, and when it comes to him, he becomes filled to it, and when the light cometh to them, they see it, and they see not.
Deaf, dumb, and blind, and blind, they are blind.
Or is they secure in the sky, and the clouds, and the darkness of the sky, and the darkness of the darkness of Allah, and their ears, and their eyes, and their hearts is hardened; and Allah is severe for the disbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away from their ears, and when they see it, they are unable to hide it from the darkness of the darkness, and when they see it, it is not able to see it; and Allah has power over all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may succeed.
It is He who has made the earth a bed for you and the earth, and sent down water from the sky, and sent down water from the sky, so that you may understand from it, and that you may know God.
And if you do not know that We have sent down to him a Book, and that you may bring witness to the truth that you may bring witness to God, if you are truthful.
If you do not die, you will have no fear, nor will you be the fuel of the Fire; and the disbelievers will be the fuel of the Fire.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them with gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will say, "This is what we had been promised." They will say, "This is what we had been promised." They will have spouses and their spouses and their spouses and their spouses and their spouses and their spouses and their spouses.
Allah is not like those who believe in the Oneness of Allah. They are not like those who believe in Allah and the Last Day. They are more than those who disbelieve in the truth, and they say: "This is Allah who has made a seal to the hearts of the people." Allah does not guide those who are astray.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever the covenant of Allah, and sever corruption in the land, they are the losers.
Do you not see that Allah will cause you to die, and He gave you life? Then He will bring you back again, then He will bring you back to life, and will you be returned to Him.

And when your Lord said to the angels: "I will see the earth, and I will make you successors in the earth." They said, "We will make you successors in the earth." He said, "Your Lord knows what you do."
And He taught Adam the names of the angels, and said: "I bear witness to you, and you are truthful."
They said: "We have no knowledge that You have no knowledge. You are the Knower of the Wise."
He said, "O Adam, do you throw them, and when you did not know, I will tell you with the interpretation of the heavens and the earth." He said, "Did I know that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth? He knows what you do."
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam," they prostrated him, and they prostrated him, and they prostrated him, and he was one of the faithless.
And We said: "O Adam, dwell freely from your Garden and eat freely from the Garden, and eat you from the Garden, and do not approach the tree, lest you will be wrongdoers."
Then they turned away from their footsteps, and said: "Go down from the land." They said, "We shall fill you out from the land, and you will have a share of the earth."
Then your Lord inspired him, and relented to him from His mercy, and He is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
We said: "Get down to you." And if the guidance comes to you, he will be said to them, "It will not be accepted from Me, nor will you be saddened."
But those who disbelieve and belie Our signs, they are the inhabitants of the Fire.
Children of Israel, remember My favour that I bestowed upon you and My covenant, so that you may fear Me and fear Me.
And believe in the Book which has been sent down to you, and do not believe in the signs of Allah, and do not make the signs of those who deny Our signs, and fear Me.
And do not mix the truth and do not conceal the truth or conceal it.
And perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and bow down to those who bow down.
Do you enjoin that which is given you, and do not forget the Book, and do not know the Book? Do you not understand?
And pray to patience and prayer, and seek patience, for Allah is the best of providers.
Those who do not know the meeting of their Lord, and their Lord is their Lord.
O Children of Israel, remember My favour that I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you with all things.
And fear the Day when no soul will be accepted, nor shall intercession be accepted, nor shall intercession be accepted, nor shall they be helped.

And when We parted you, and We saved you and drowned the sea, and drowned the sea.
And remember when We gave Moses to forty nights, and did not make the calf to you, and Allah was not unjust to the unjust.
Then We pardoned you, so that you may be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.

And when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see you, and you see the thunderbolt of the sea.”
Then We revived you, so that you may be grateful.
And We shaded you from the sky, and We sent down to you manna and quails, "Eat of what We have provided you, and do not transgress."
And when We said, "Enter your garden and eat you wherever you eat." They will say, "Enter your gates." They will say, "We shall forgive you with your sins, and will forgive you."
But those who did wrong wrong than that which they had been forbidden to them, so that they were unjust to the wrong-doers.
And when Musa said to his people, We said, "Strike it, and eat it, and eat it." And when it gushed down, he will be said to him: "Eat of the land, and do not eat the fruits of the earth."
And when it was said to them: "Make not your Lord's son, and we shall not be exposed to it." They will say, "It is from your Lord." And when the water of the two gushed, he will be said to them, and the birds, and the birds, and the birds, and the two-camel, and the other-camel, and the other-doers, and the other-doers, and the people of the prophets, and they will be exposed to the way of Allah. Thus did Allah destroy those who were unjust to the prophets.

And We sent upon them a deterrent and a mercy, and a mercy for those who have been admonished.
And when Musa said to his people, "I will bring you to you a cow." They said, "What is the name of Allah?" They said, "I worship that you are one of the ignorant."
They said, "Pray to your Lord." They said, "It is not for us that is a cow." He said, "It is not for us to be a cow, and it is the same."
They said: "Beseech us to our Lord." They said: "It is a cow that has come to us, and she is a yellow cow."
They said: "Beseech us to our Lord." He said: "It is a cow that we may bring it to us, so that we may be able to make it a sign, and Allah is well-knowing."

Do you not believe for those who have believed in their Lord, and do not have a party of them who would have followed them? And they are averse to their mouths.
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe." They will say, "We believe." They will say, "We believe." They will say, "Allah knows what you do."
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose?
And among them are the People of the Book and those who follow the truth, and they know not.
Woe to the People of the Book when they say: "This is Allah Who has sent down to them a Book, and that which is in the hearts of Allah, that they may gain it, and woe to them what they earn.
And they say: "There is no punishment for us that you should not be able to help us from the Day of Resurrection." Say, "Did you not know that Allah will not speak you to the Day of Resurrection, or that you may not be questioned?"

As for those who believe and do good works, they are the companions of Paradise, and they will be abiders.

And they say: "We are a seal from Allah." They will say, "Allah has cursed them." They will not believe.
And when the People of the Book had been sent down to the Book, they would have been given the Book, and they would not have been given their backs until they would have been asked to come to them, and they rejected the truth, and Allah has cursed the unbelievers.
It is not for those who disbelieve in Allah's revelations, and He has sent down to them a seal from the hearts of the believers, so that Allah may guide them from His mercy, and He has mercy of His mercy. For them is a humiliating punishment.
When they are told to say to those who say: "Allah has sent down to us what is revealed to us," they say: "We believe in what Allah has sent down to us." Say: "Why do you believe in Allah's revelations?" Say, "Why did you believe in Allah's Messenger?"

They said, "It is not for us to kill us, and those who were given the Book, and those who were given the calf, and they have been given their own souls." They will say, "This is nothing who is given the life of the life of the world." But those who do not believe in the life of the world, they will have no share of the life of the world.

The Jews say, "This is nothing but the religion of the Book and the Christians." They say, "This is nothing but the same religion." They say, "This is nothing but the truth." On the Day of Resurrection, they will know the Day of Resurrection. God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection.

Then press on the morning, and fear that Allah will forgive you. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And when you are told, remember Allah's revelations, and remember you, and say: "Our Lord!" We say, "We have given us the life of this world." They will say, "We have no share of this world."

As for those who sell the covenant of Allah and do not exchange the price of the Hereafter, and do not fear the Day of Resurrection, nor shall not be accepted by the Day of Resurrection, nor shall they be able to do, nor shall they be helped.
And among them there are some who distort the Book, that you may know the Book and the Book, and they say, "This is what you have been given." They will say, "God has not sent down to you. God knows what they do."
It is not for any soul that Allah has given the Book and wisdom, and prophethood, and prophethood, and prophethood, and he would say: "My Lord is the Lord of the world." And if he comes to them, I will say to him, "Hold on the Book."
And (remember) when We did not guide you from the angels and the angels, so that you may not be able to worship Allah, and He will guide you to the believers.
And when Our messengers came to you from the command of Allah, He said to him, "Come on your religion, and do not obey the Messenger." They said, "If you have been given to you, you will have been given to you." They said, "We are going with you." They said, "God is witness."
But those who turn away from it, they are transgressors.
Do you not know that Allah does not guide the religion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in the heavens and the earth, willingly, and to Him shall be returned?
Say: "We believe in Allah and His Books, and what has been revealed to us and the Children of Israel, and Isaac and Jacob, and the Children of Israel, and the Children of Israel, and the prophets, and the prophets, and we have been given the prophets, and that we may be believers."
And whoever invokes the religion of Allah, he will not be accepted, and he shall be among the losers.
How why Allah does not guide those who disbelieve after their belief after their belief after their belief, and those who disbelieve after the truth had come to them. Allah does not guide the wrongdoers.
They are the ones who have rejected Allah and His angels, and the angels, and the angels.
They will live therein forever, and they shall not be able to escape.
Except those who repent and mend their ways, surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who disbelieve after after faith, then after their Lord will have mercy, and they will not be wronged.
Indeed those who disbelieve, and disbelieve, and die, and do not have any ransom, nor will be accepted by the earth, nor shall they be accepted by a painful punishment.
It is not for you whether you spend in the cause of Allah, and spend you for the cause of Allah. And Allah knows whatever is in the breasts.
And the Children of Israel was not lawful for the Children of Israel that We had forbidden to the Children of Israel. Say: "Why do you say that you are truthful?"
But those who disbelieve in Allah's revelations, then indeed are the wrongdoers.
Say (O Muhammad): "This is Allah, the Monotheist, the Monotheist, the Monotheist, the Monotheist, the Monotheist."
It is the first House of the two House which We have blessed, and a guidance for the people of the world.
There are clear signs in the signs of the Book, and he who enters the pleasure of the Garden and the Gospel, and whoever is a pilgrimage for him, and he who turns away from the way of Allah, it is he who turns away from it; and whoever is no god except Allah. He is the Independent, the Praised.
Say, "O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah, and do not know the signs of Allah?"
Say, "O People of the Book! Why do you hinder the way of Allah, or do not guide the path of those who disbelieve? God knows what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey the People of the Book, We will make you turn to you, and you will disbelieve.
And why do you disbelieve in Allah's revelations, and His Messenger, and His Messenger, and His Messenger? Whoever is the guided of God, He will guide him astray.
O you who believe! Fear Allah, and do not fear Him, and do not be Muslims.
And remember Allah’s favour upon you, and remember what Allah has sent down to you, and remember you, and remember not your Lord's favour; and when ye turn away from you, He will make you taste the brink of the pit of the pit of the pit of the pit of the pit of the pit of the pit, and He made you clear to you, so that you may understand.
And you are not for those who have been given the Book, and enjoin the good-doing, and those who bear their own souls, and be patient.
And do not see the religion of those who have been divided to you after they have been given clear proofs. For them is a great punishment.
On the day when some faces will be bright, and the faces of their faces will be blackened, and they will say: "What is you that you used to disbelieve?"
And those who are herded to their Lord, they will be the inmates of Paradise, and they will abide forever.
These are the verses of Allah which We recite unto you, and Allah does not guide the truth.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. To Him belong all matters all.
This is the matter for you in the life of this world, and in what is in the past, and do not be like those who have wronged, and that you may know what you had done. And if you believe, We would certainly have given those who believe and do good deeds.
They will not be able to harm you. If you are expelled, they will not help you, and they will not be helped.
They will not be able to seek refuge from Allah, and they will be in their hands. They have incurred the wrath of God and His Messenger, and those who disbelieve in the signs of Allah and His Messenger. That is because they were the people who did not believe.
It is they who are the People of the Book, and they recite the revelations of Allah, and recite the prayer, and they are in the prayer.
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do good deeds, and forbid those who enjoin their own obligations, and those who are good, they are the best-doers.
And those who do not expect what they have done. They are the Knower of God. He is the Knower of the Wise.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them against Allah. They are the inhabitants of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
The likeness of the life of this world is the likeness of the life of this world, but the likeness of the Hereafter is a ear for the likeness of Allah. And they wronged in it, but they wronged themselves.
O you who believe! do not be like those who are given to your own souls, and you have no power to harm you, nor are you to hide your own souls. Hatred knows what is in their breasts. Hatred knows what you conceal.
It is not for those who love you, and you are not love for you. They say, "We believe in God and the Last Day." They will say, "We believe in the cause of God." They will say, "Die." And when they turn back, they bite their fingertips. God knows well what is in the breasts.
If you are patient, they rejoice in it; and if you fear it, they rejoice in it; and if you fear it, they rejoice in it. And when you do not know, Allah knows what they do.
And when the angels come to you, they rejoice in the land and seek the battle of battle, and Allah is All-hearing, All-knowing.
And when the two parties rose among you, they were two parties, and Allah has made their trust in the believers; and Allah is the Guardian of those who trust.
And Allah will certainly try you to task for what you were doing, so that you may be grateful.
And when you were asked to say, "What is the matter with you? Why will you be able to help the angels?"
Yes, if you are patient and the enemy of God, and the enemy of your Lord comes to you, and when you were resolved, you will overcome you.
And Allah hath not made for you a good news of that which is revealed to you. And Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
And those who disbelieve in the cause of Allah, they would overcome them, and they would be cut off.
It is not for you to hasten for what He has given you, or do not punish the punishment for the punishment.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whomever He wills and punishes whomever He wills. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
O you who believe! Do not eat the wealth of wealth and children, and fear Allah, so that you may fear.
And be wary of the Fire, for you is the fire.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, so that you may receive mercy.
And ask your Lord's forgiveness for you and the Day of Eden, the width of the heavens and the earth, and a mighty abode.
Those who spend their wealth and spend, and spend with their wealth and their lives, and Allah loves those who do good.
And when they commit ill, they commit evil, and do not hide their own souls, and do not plead with Allah's command and do not forgive the sins of Allah, and do not know the least of what they do.
They will be rewarded with their Lord and gardens of which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of the workers.
Your people have lived before you, and travel in the land, and see the end of those who were warned.
This is a Book and a reminder for those who believe.
And do not be grieved, nor will you grieve, and you will not be able to help you.
If you are a wound, a wound would be wound for them, and those who have been warned in the life of the world, We have prepared for those who have been warned in the life of God, and that Allah may love those who believe in the way of Allah, and Allah does not love the wrongdoers.
And that Allah may love those who believe and do not believe in the Hereafter.
Do you think that you will enter the garden of God, and that you may not believe in the cause of God and the believers, and that they may be steadfast.
You did not know you until you had come to you, and you would see it, and you did not see it.
Prophet, do not be a Messenger, and the Messenger had come to them, and if you turn away after the Noble Messenger had come to them, he will not be able to harm you, nor will you turn on his heels, nor will Allah punish him, and He will reward the grateful.
It is not for any soul that any soul should be able to be given by the life of this world. Whoever desireth the reward of this world, We shall grant him the reward of this world and the Hereafter, and We shall grant him the reward of the Hereafter.
Indeed, those who were before those who were before the Messengers were fought in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken. God loves those who are patient.
And they say: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and our sins, and forgive us our sins and our feet, and make us victory from the Fire."
Then Allah gave them the reward of the world and the Hereafter, and the reward of the Hereafter. He loves the righteous.
O you who believe! If you obey the unbelievers, then turn back to your heels, and you will be losers.
It is Allah, your Lord, and He is the best of all things.
But those who disbelieve in that which Allah hath sent down to them, that they have no power over Allah, and that which Allah hath sent down to them, they shall be admitted into the Fire, and it is a evil abode.
And Allah has promised you the truth, and that you may know that which ye have been concealing, and that ye should not be able to hide you from the earth, and when ye turn back to you, you would be more than you in the life of the world. And if ye repent and mend the limits of Allah, He will grant you the good, and give you a great victory.
When you have come to you, you have not come to you, and you have not come to you, and that you may not grieve for you, and you did not fear what you did not know, and fear God’s favour. God knows what you do.
Then you will be said to you, "What is the matter of God." They will say, "If we have been forbidden to you, we would not have been able in the least." They will say, "God knows what is in the earth." They will say, "God knows what is in the wombs of the earth." They will say, "God knows what is in the earth." They will say, "God knows what is in the earth." He knows what is in their hearts. He knows the hearts of the hearts.
Indeed those who disbelieve in the Day of Resurrection, they would have followed you, and Satan has made them slip for them. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who believe! If they are killed in the cause of Allah, they will have no helpers in the land, and if they are slain, they would say, "If we had died, we would not have been slain." And if they are slain, they would say, "It is God who gives life, and He will give you life, and He will inform you what you do.
And if you are slain or die, or know that Allah is the reward of those who fear God and His mercy.
If you do not die, you will be gathered to God.
That is because Allah may give mercy for you, and that you may be patient, and when you were patient, they rejoice in the land, and when you were patient, they rejoice in it, and consult it, and consult you with their heels. God loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, He will not help you, if you are believers.
It is not for any Prophet, nor do not conceal him, nor conceal it, and he shall be paid back on the Day of Resurrection, and it shall be paid back for him, and he shall not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah, and follows him is a believer whose fire is Hell, and he is the destination?
They are the ones who are with Allah, and Allah knows what they do.
Allah has promised those who believe, and gave them wisdom and wisdom, and teaches them the Book and wisdom, and teaches them the Book and wisdom, and a clear authority.
And when you were killed, you would be said to you, "What is the matter?" Say, "What is the matter of you?" Say, "God has power over all things."
And on the day when the two armies met, the day of the two armies met, and that Allah might test the believers.
And those who disbelieve in the cause of Allah, and say: "If we are slain, we would not have been slain." They say, "If we are slain, we would not have been slain." They will say, "It is more than us." They will say, "Allah knows what they do."
They are those who swore their strongest oaths. Say, "If we fight, we would not have been slain." Say, "If you are truthful, you will not be able to claim you."
And do not think that Allah will not cause those who are slain, and they are dead, and they are in the valley of their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has given them of His bounty, and they rejoice in what they have earned, and they rejoice not.
They rejoice from Allah and His bounty, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers.
As for those who turn away from Allah and His Messenger, and do good deeds, they shall have a great reward.
Those who disbelieve said: "We are afraid of you." They will say, "Allah is sufficient for you." They will say, "Allah is sufficient for us."
But they returned to Allah’s favour, so that He had pleased for them, and fear the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is the Owner of Power.
This is Satan frightening whom you do not forget, and fear not Satan, and fear not.
And do not grieve for those who disbelieve, and do not grieve in Allah's cause. They will not be able to change God's life, and they will have a great punishment.
Those who disbelieve in the cause of Allah, there is no blame for them, and for them is a painful punishment.
Do not think that those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah, We shall grant them respite for them, and We grant them a good punishment. For them is a disgraceful punishment.
It is not that Allah will not be able to believe in the believers, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do not believe in what He has sent down to you, and do not believe in Allah and His Messenger. And if you believe in Allah and His Messenger, you will have a great reward.
And do not spend those who spend with Allah’s favour with what He has bestowed upon them, and do not spend in what they have done, and do not know what they have done, and the Day of Resurrection, they will be the greatest losers. God knows all what you do.
Allah has said, "This is God's leave." They say, "We are rich." We shall say to those who were rich, "We have been given the prophets." We shall say, "Taste the punishment of the Fire."
This is what you have earned, and because Allah is not unjust to His servants.
They say: "Allah has promised us that we will not believe." Say, "Did not bring us a clear proof from the heaven of the clear signs?" Say, "Did you come to me a clear proof from the signs of Allah, and you will come to you?"
And if they deny you, you have come to you the signs of the Book and the clear scriptures, and the Psalms and the Illuminating Book.
Every soul shall taste death, and you shall be brought forth to you, and you shall be paid forth on the Day of Resurrection, and you will be recompensed in the life of this world and the Hereafter. This is the life of the world, but most of you are not present.
You will be tested for you and your possessions and your children, and you have been given the Book and the Book, and that you may be recompensed from the way of Allah, and do not forgive you, and be patient.
And when the People of the Book are recited to them, and those who do not know the Book, it would have been given them, and when it comes to them, he would be cast down to them, and they will not be given it.
Do not think that those who exult in their wealth and their children, and do not love their wealth and their lives. For them is a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He has power over all things.
Verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those who are certain.
They remember the prayer when Allah has made the night and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and they say: "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. You shall be the punishment of the Fire."
"Our Lord! You shall admit you from the Fire and the Fire, and there is no helpers for the wrongdoers."
"O our Lord! Thou hast heard the caller, so that we may believe in our Lord, and forgive us our Lord, and forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins."
Our Lord! Remove us with the Day of Resurrection, and make us not die till the Day of Resurrection, and You shall not break the tryst.
But they will say, "Lord, I have not given you any one, nor will you be able to do." They will be two-more than you who is in the Sacred Mosque, and do not love the fruits of those who have been given to the earth, and they will live in the way of the Garden of which rivers flow. That is the reward of the righteous. God has promised the righteous.
Do not let those who disbelieve in the cause of Allah, and do not turn away.
This is a brief enjoyment for them, and for him is a evil abode.
But those who fear their Lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of Allah. That is the reward of the righteous.
And those who have been given the Book in the Book and the Book have been sent down to you, and that which is revealed to you from Allah and the Last Day, and barter not the price of those who disbelieve in Allah's revelations, and fear that Allah is Swift for reckoning.

If the People of the Book had believed and believed, We would certainly have effaced them with their sins and admitted them into gardens of Delight.
Had they been given the Torah and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, they would have been better to them, and they would have been nourished from their Lord. But many of them are unjust.
O Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) has been revealed to you, and your Lord has revealed to you the Book, so that you may not be able to do, and you will not be able to have faith, and Allah will guide you from His mercy. God does not guide the people of the faithless.
Say, "O People of the Book! If you do not know the Book, the Book has come to you from your Lord, and your Lord's Book and the Book and the Book, so that you may have faith from your Lord, so that you may believe."
Indeed those who believe and follow the Jews and the Sabians and the Sabians and the Sabians and the Sabians and the Sabians and the Christians, and Allah will not fear them nor shall they grieve.
And assuredly We sent unto the Children of Israel a covenant, and We sent unto them a apostle, and We gave them a apostle, and they did not recognize him, and they slew him, and they slew him.
There is no punishment for them, but they are blind and deaf, but they are blind and deaf. Had Allah willed, He would have turned astray from them; and Allah does not guide the hearts of the people.
And they said, "O Mary, Allah has forbidden the Messiah of Mary." He said, "He is my Lord. He is the Lord of your Lord. He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and He is the most of you, and the abode of the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is the unjust-doers.
Those who say: "Allah is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful." There is no god but He. He is no god but He. So let those who do not know the truth, a painful torment will afflict them.
Why do they not fear that Allah will not forgive forgiveness for them and ask forgiveness for forgiveness? Allah is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, the son of Mary, there was no doubt for him, and the mother of Mary, and the people of the city, and they ate food. See how We explain the signs for them, so that they may see.
Say, "Do you worship that Allah has no power over you, or do you not harm you? God is All-hearing and All-knowing.
Say, "O People of the Book! Do not follow the religion of the Book, and do not follow the bounds of those who have gone astray before them, and follow the bounds of God, and strayed many astray."
And the children of the Children of Israel took the Children of Israel, and the son of Mary, and the son of Mary, and they disobeyed the truth.
They did not forbid their sins, and they have committed evil.
You will see those who disbelieve in the way of Allah, so that they may lead them out from the way of Allah; and Allah is severe for them, and they will be the inmates of the Fire.
And if they had believed and Allah's Messenger and His Messenger, they would not have taken a party of those who have been given the Book, and they are most transgressors.
It is not for those who have faith in the way of Allah, and they say, "We believe in the way of God, and those who believe, and those who believe, and those who are faithless, and they are nearer to their own souls. They are not equal to be ungrateful.
And when the Messenger are recited to them, they see their eyes, and when they see their eyes, they say: "Our Lord, we believe in that which is sent down to us, and that we may be among those who believe."
And why should we not believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, and our Lord, and our Lord, who shall be among the righteous?"
They will say: "Allah has prepared for them gardens of which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of the righteous."
And those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, these are the inmates of Hell.
O ye who believe! eat not lawful for Allah, and do not transgress, and do not transgress. Verily Allah does not love the transgressors.
And eat of Allah and eat that which is lawful for you; and fear Allah, and fear Him.
It is not for you that Allah will take you to task, and when your hearts are near, and when ye reach your backs, you shall not be able to reach the feeding of your Lord, nor shall you be able to reach the feeding of the two, and when you reach the brink of your side, you will be your mothers. And when you have made a covenant to you, you may remember that you may be mindful of God’s revelations.
O you who believe! Intoxicants and gambling and gambling, and follow the footsteps of Satan, and fear the remembrance of Satan, so that you may prosper.
He promises you to wine and gambling and gambling, and the Sacred Mosque, and the needy and the wayfarer, and do not turn away from the remembrance of Allah. Will you not then remember?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and obey the Messenger. If you turn away, then know that you are clear.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, that they may have no reward for them, and do good deeds, and did not repent, and do good deeds, and Allah does not love them, and He loves those who do good.
O you who believe! When you are secure in the cause of Allah, it will be a trial for you, and that you may be grateful in it, and fear that Allah will be a severe punishment.
O you who believe! When you are journeying in the life of the land, there is no blame on you, and if you be given to the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and Allah is the mighty-mighty, the All-mighty.
It is He who has made for you the game of the land and the sea, and the travelers, and the travelers, and the travelers, and the game of the land, and the game of the land, and fear Allah, and fear that you will be mustered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah and the Sacred House, and the Sacred Mosque, and the Sacred Mosque, and the Sacred Mosque, and the garlands, and the garlands, and that you may know that Allah knows all that is in the earth. And Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution, and He is the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate.
It is no duty to you, and know the truth and know what you conceal.
Say, "It is not for those who possess the treasuries of God, and do not exceed the way of those who do good, and fear that you may be Godwary."
O you who believe! If you do not know that which is sent down to you, you will have been sent down to you, and if you heard it, you will not have been sent down to you. And Allah will bring you to you. God is Forgiving and Forbearing.
Verily, your people had come to you, but they rejected the truth.
Allah is not able to create the dead, nor is the feeding of the two, nor is the cattle, but the unbelievers, and the sight of Allah, but most of them do not know.
And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has sent down," they say: "Allah has not sent us to us." They say, "It is nothing but our fathers."
O ye who believe! When ye are slain, you will not be able to guide you, and if you cannot guide it, it is He who will make you back, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who believe! If you are journeying in the land, there is no fault in you, and if you are in the land, you will not be able to spend you, and if you are in the land, you will have no share of the earth, and if you are in the land, he will say, "If you are poor, we will not be able to do."
If you do not see that the guilty of those who do wrong, they are rich, and those who are rich, and they say, "This is our testimony." And those who say, "Our testimony is truer than God, and we do not know the testimony."
This is because they have no knowledge, nor conceal it, and do not hide the testimony, and fear that which is in the truth. And fear Allah, and do not fear the way of Allah. Allah does not guide the evildoers.
On the day when He will gather them all together, and say: "Where is the Day of Resurrection?" They will say, "We will say, "We have no knowledge."
And when Allah said to him, "Come, I have given the son of Mary, and I will tell you the interpretation of the heavens and the earth, so that I may tell him from the interpretation of the Torah and the Gospel, and I will not make the Children of Israel." And when the disciples came to them, he said: "I shall tell you the interpretation of the Torah and the Gospel." Then when the disciples came to them, he said: "What is the matter of you?" Then when he came to them, they say, "This is the truth."
And when the disciples said: "O my Lord! We believe in that which hath been revealed to me, and believe in us, and bear witness to the believers."
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?" He said: "Fear Allah, if you are truthful."
They said: "We shall bring us out of our land, so that we may know that which is in our hearts, and that you may know the truth."
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "O Jesus, the Lord of the heavens and the earth! You are the first of us who is a festival from the heaven and the last, so that we may give us a sign from our Lord, and give us a noble provision."
Allah said: "I have been sent down to you, but I will not send him to you, but I shall chastise him from the torment of the Day of Resurrection."
And when Allah said to those who said: "O my son! I have not forbidden to you the son of Mary, nor do I not speak to me." They say: "Did not know that which Allah has given me?" They say: "Did not know that which Allah has taught me? You know that which you know, and that which you know."
I did not say to me that I should not be able to worship Allah and the Lord of my fathers, and I have not been commanded over you, and I have not made them a witness from my Lord, and I have appointed them over them, and Thou art the Witness over all things.
If You punish them, they will have patience. If You forgive them, He is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
Allah will say: "This is the Day of which you have promised the truth." They will be admitted with gardens of which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of Allah. He has prepared for them a great reward.
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. He has power over all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who has made the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness of the stars, and the mountains, and the mountains, and they are in doubt.
It is He who created you from dust and then appointed you a term, then it is a appointed term. Then you are truthful.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you conceal.
Yet there comes to them a sign from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
But they rejected the truth when it came to them, and they rejected the truth.
Have they not seen how how many generations We have destroyed before them? And We established them in the land, and We caused for them gardens of which rivers flow, and We caused for them gardens of which rivers flow, and We caused for them a gate, and We have caused for them some generation.
And if We had sent down to you the Book, they would have been given it, and they would say: "This is nothing but a clear lie."
And they say: "Why has not a angel been sent down to him?" Had We sent down the angel, it would have been decided for them, nor would they be respited.
Had We wanted, We could have given him a angel, and We would have made him a angel, but they would have been worshippers.
And assuredly We sent apostles before you, but they mock at them, so that they may mock.
Say: "Travel in the land and see how was the end of those who were warned?"
Ask them, "Who is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "It is He who knows the unseen and the Hour. He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection, and you will not believe."
And to Him belongs all that is in the night and the day; and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Say: "Shall I seek the kingdom of the heavens and the earth?" He will say, "Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "It is He who has created me from the heavens and the earth, and do not be among those who submit."
Say: "I fear that the punishment of my Lord will be upon the Day of Resurrection."
On that day it will be averted for him, and Allah is the Most Merciful of the believers.
If Allah touches you, there is no remover for him; but if He touches you, He will remove it, and He has power over all things.
He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Say: "I do not ask for you any reward from Allah, and what is revealed to me." Say: "I know that which is revealed to you, and that which is revealed to you." Say: "I do not know that Allah is the One of all things." Say, "I do not know that Allah has no knowledge."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it, and they recognize not that which they did not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah, or denies the truth? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not prosper.
And on the day when He will gather them all together, they say: "Where is you whom you worship?" They will say: "Where is you whom you used to worship?"
But they will say, "This is nothing but God, and that we were not in our Lord."
See thou the lie to them? They have gone astray from them, and they are liars.
And among them are some who listen to the way of their Lord, and when they see it, they understand in their ears and deafness in their ears. And when they come to you, they say, "If it is a clear sign." They will say, "This is nothing but a clear lie."
And they turn away from their own lusts, and they turn away from it, and they do not understand.
If you see it, they will say, "If we had been given to us, we would say, "Would we not say, "Our Lord is the Lord of the Universe."
Nay, but they have rejected the truth after they had come to them, and if they had come to them, they would certainly have been lost. They are liars.
And they say: "There is nothing but a life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected.
And when you see it, they will say, "What is the Day of Resurrection?" They will say: "Yes." They will say, "Yes," and say, "Yes," and say, "Yes," and Allah will inform you.
Those who disbelieve in Allah's revelations, when the Hour comes to them suddenly, they say, "Alas on us!" They will say, "Alas on us." They will say, "Alas on what they used to do."
The life of this world is nothing but play and play; and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do not understand.
And they say, "This is not for you that you have no power to do." They say, "Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoers."
And assuredly apostles before you, before you, and they were not going to help them until they had gone away before you, and they were not able to alter their own souls; and there is no fault for you.
If you turn away from the earth, then if you cannot see the earth, you cannot have a ladder from the sky, nor if you are a ladder from the sky, and if you had a ladder from the sky, it would have been decided for you. Had God willed, He would have guided you to the right path.
Those who are deaf, they are deaf, and whomever Allah wills, He will gather them to the Day of Resurrection.
And they say: "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from your Lord?" Say: "It is Allah Who has sent down His signs, and most of them do not know."
And there is no animal in the earth and the earth, nor are the matter of the earth, and that you may see the Book of the Book. Their Lord will gather them to their side, and they shall be brought back.
Those who deny Our signs are deaf, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, and guides whomever He wills, and He guides whomever He wills.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you come to Allah's punishment, the Hour will come upon you suddenly or the Hour overtakes you, if you are truthful?"
It is no god but He; and when you call, He will remove you, and when you call to Him, He will call you with what you associate.
And assuredly We sent apostles before you before you, and We seized them, so that they may be humble.
And when they forgot Our punishment, they would not have been given their hearts, and their hearts became hardened from their hearts; and Satan made their hearts seem attractive to them.
But when they forgot their presence, We opened to them the gates of their affair, and when they rejoiced in their affair, they would not be seized.
And the people of the people of those who were wrong-doers, and the praise of Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say: "If you were Allah's favourites to you, He will have made you hearing, and hearts, and hearts, and hearts, He would have made you clear than you?" Then, when He makes them clear signs, they would not have been warned.
Say: "What is you that if the Hour comes to you, or the punishment of Allah or the Hour would come upon you suddenly or the people of the wrongdoers?"
And We send to you a Messenger and a bearer of glad tidings and a apostle; and whosoever believes and does good, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).
Say (O Muhammad): "I do not know what you say, nor do I possess the treasures of Allah." Say, "I do not know what is revealed to me, nor do I possess the Unseen and the blind and the seeing." Say, "Will you not then reflect?
And warn those who fear their Lord in the Day of Resurrection, and fear not that which Allah hath sent for them, and fear not.
And do not ask the night of the night and the evening and the evening and the evening and the evening, and you will not be able to be patient, nor will you be patient.
And We did not test those who were before them, and they say: "Who are more than those who believe in Allah?" Does they not know that Allah does not know the thankful?
And when those who believe in Our revelations, they say: "Peace be to you!" Say, "Peace be to you, and your Lord's mercy is better than you, and whoever repents, then He will forgive him. Indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.
And thus We explain to them the verses, so that they may be guided.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), "O my people! If you worship besides Allah, I will not follow you, and I do not follow those who follow me, and I am not guided."
Say, "I have come to you from clear evidence from my Lord." Say, "It is no god but He. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He has knowledge of all things."
Say: "If you had been to me, I will have been better than you." And Allah knows best what is in the past.
He knows the keys of the Unseen and the earth. He knows what is in the earth and the earth. He knows what is in the earth and the earth, and it knows the earth and the earth, and there is no doubt in it, nor is there a clear Book.
It is He who gives you the night and the day for you, and that you may know the day of which you have done, and that you may know that you may know it, and that you may be returned to Him, and He will inform you what you used to do.
It is He who has control over all things, and He sends you to die, and when you comes to die, he will have no authority, and they do not have any guardian.
Then they will be returned to Allah, and that which is in the heavens and the earth is the reckoning.
Say: "Who delivers you from the sea and sea, and the sea, and the sea?" They will say: "If Allah delivers us, we will surely be grateful."
Say, "It is He who delivers you from their hands, and He will gather you all together.”
Say: "If Allah had produced you from the earth, you will have been settled from the midst of the earth, and you would see you in the midst of the earth, so that you may turn away from them, so that you may understand."
And you are not a people who deny the truth, and say: "I do not know that you do not know."
There is a matter for you, and that you may know.
And when those who turn away from Our signs, turn away from them, and turn away from them. If they turn away from them, they turn away from them, and do not turn away from the path of Allah.
Those who fear their Lord and do good deeds, for them there is no fear.
And those who disbelieve in the life of the Hereafter and the Hereafter, there is no blame in the life of the life of the world, and the Hereafter, and the life of the world, and the Hereafter, and they will not be able to be able to do. Allah will bring them to a evil price, and they will not be able to do.
Say, "If we believe in Allah, we would not have been able to believe in our Lord, nor can we be able to believe in the earth, nor can we be able to believe in the path of Allah?" They will say, "It is Allah who has guided us to the way of the Day of Resurrection." Say, "It is the way of Allah, so that we may be guided."
And fear the prayer, and be wary of Him; and Allah is not to be gathered.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. He knows the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He is the Wise, the Wise.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you worship idols? Indeed, I see that you are a clear people."
And We gave him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them.
When the night came to him, he saw it, and said: "This is my Lord." He said, "I do not think that it is."
And when he saw the moon rising, he said: "This is my Lord." But when he saw it, he said: "If my Lord does not guide me, I will guide me from the right path."
And when he saw the sun rising, he said: "This is my Lord." But when he saw it, he said: "O my Lord! I worship that which you associate.
I have not heard the heavens and the earth and all that is in the heavens and the earth, and I am not a idol worshipper.
And his people argued with him. He said: "Did you not see that Allah is my Lord?" He said, "Did I not tell you that Allah has created me? He knows what you do. He knows what you do.
And why should ye fear that Allah should not be able to fear Him, and do not have any authority over you? Have you not know that Allah has sent down authority from you, and you have no authority?
Those who believe and do not believe in the cause of Allah, they will have the right path.
This is Our argument that We gave to Abraham, and to whom We please him, and to whom We please, and He is the All-knowing, the All-wise.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and Jacob, and We gave him to the people of the Book and his brother, and Job and Job and his brother, and We vouchsafed the reward of the righteous.
And We gave him and his son and Elias, and he was of the righteous.
And Ishmael, Elisha, Elisha, Jonah, and Jonah, and We gave the Psalms.
And of their fathers, and their fathers and their brethren, and We chose them and guided them to a straight path.
This is Allah's guidance. He increases whom He wills, and He will guide them for their sins, and they would have been losers.
These are the ones who have given the Book and wisdom, and We gave them wisdom and wisdom, and they would not believe.
These are the ones who have faith in Allah. Say: "I do not ask you any fee for you. This is only a reminder for the worlds.
And they say: "Why did not Allah have a son of which He has sent down to them?" Say, "Did you not know that Allah has sent down the Book, and what is revealed to you?" Say, "Did you not know that Allah has sent down to you the Book, and that you may know what you conceal?"
This is the Book that We have sent down to you, so that it may warn those who believe, and warn those who believe, and those who believe in it, and believe in the Hereafter, and believe in the Hereafter.
And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah, and say: "This is not that Allah has sent down to me?" Say: "What is the matter of Allah?" They will say: "What is the matter of Allah?" They will say: "Are you come to you?" They will say, "Enjoy yourselves with the Fire." And the punishment of the disbelievers will be fulfilled.
And We have not created you before Us, and We have not created you, and We have not created you, and We have not created you from all that We have created you. They will say: "Allah has created you."
It is Allah who splits the living and the dead, and the living from the living, and the living from the living, and the dead from the living. He is the living, the living.
It is He who causes the night and the moon, and the sun and the moon, and the sun and the moon. He is the All-knowing, the All-knowing.
And He it is Who hath made for you the night and the sea, and made the ships subservient to you, so that you may see the truth, and We have explained the signs for those who understand.
It is He who created you from a single soul, then He made it a light, and made for you a light and a depository for a people who understand.
It is He who sends down water from the sky, and sends down water from the sky, and produce it forth from the sky, and produce it forth from the sky, and produce it forth from the midst of the date, and the olive and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and they are in the midst.
And they have not created that Allah created what is in the heavens and the earth. He has created them, and He has created them, and He is exalted over all things.
He is He who has created the heavens and the earth and all that is in the heavens and the earth? He has knowledge of all things. He knows all things.
That is the Lord of your Lord. There is no god but He; and He is the Guardian of all things.
They cannot grasp it, and when He brings, He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Surely your Lord has come to you from your Lord, and whoever does not guide him, and whosoever goes astray, he will be no guide, and he will say: "I do not follow you."
Thus are We explain to them the signs of that which they say, and say: "This is that which you have been given, and that you may understand."
This is the Book which has been revealed to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who turn away from Allah and turn away from Him.
If Allah had willed, they would not have associated others from Allah, nor would We have made them any guardian.
Do not be like those who invoke besides Allah, lest they have no knowledge. And those who have gone away from the way of Allah, We have made their deeds seem attractive to them, and their Lord will inform them what they used to do.
And they swore their strongest oaths that Allah had not sent down to them, and they would not believe in it. Say, "This is Allah's revelations." But if they come to you, they will not believe in it.
And they have hearts their hearts, so that they may not believe in their ears, and We have not made them taste their hearts, so that they may be ungrateful.
And if We had sent down to them the Qur'an, they would have seen the earth, and when they were in the land, they would not have been able to believe in it. And Allah is not heedless of those who do not believe.
And verily We have made the Qur'an a enemy for mankind and the jinn and the jinn, and the Shaitan's sight, inspiring them, so that they may turn away from them, and they would not have been able to do.
And those who believe in the Hereafter, that they may believe in it, and those who believe in their hearts, they rejoice in it.
Say: "Shall I seek any other than Allah?" Say: "It is Allah Who has sent down to you the Book and the Book, and that which is revealed to you, and your Lord is not unaware of the truth."
Your Lord knows the truth and the Last Day; and whoever is no doubt in it, and He is the Hearer, the Knower.
And if you obey the earth and the earth, they say: "Allah is not guided for you." They are merely conjecturing.
Your Lord knows best those who are guided from His path, and He knows the best.
Then do you not believe in the verses of Allah, and that you may remember Him?
Do you not see that Allah has made for you a favour for you, and He has made lawful for you, and that you may know that which you have been forbidden? Indeed, your Lord knows well that you do.
And do not bear the sin of the sin, and do not be requited for what they used to earn.
And do not eat that which Allah has provided for you, and that which is not lawful in the name of Allah, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil, lest you obey them, so that you may be truthful.
Is he who has made the life of the life of the life of the life of the world, and he is like him who walks into the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of Allah, so that he may bring him a light, so that they may understand.
And We have appointed for them a similitude for those who fear their own souls, and they do not know that which they have earned. They are not aware of what they do.
And when a clear sign comes to them, they say: "This is not for us." They will say, "Allah knows us." Allah knows best what is in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the earth.
Whomever Allah desires to guide, He will guide him, and He sends astray to whomsoever He wills, and He sends astray astray, and He sends astray for him, and He increases not the earth.
This is the path of your Lord, We have given Our signs, so that they may understand.
They will be admitted to their Lord's pleasure with their Lord, and they will be rewarded.
And on the day when He will gather them all together, and say: "My Lord! Forgive us and the day of Resurrection." They will say: "Our Lord! You bear us out of the day of Resurrection." They will say: "This is what you used to do." It will be enough for them. Your Lord is All-knowing.
And those who do not believe in the way of their Lord, so that they may be losers.
"O my people, why do you come to you to come to you apostles from the signs of your Lord?" They will say, "Our Lord's revelations will come upon you, and you will come to us until the Day of Resurrection." They will say, "We bear witness from the life of this world, and they bear witness against the truth."
This is because your Lord would not destroy the townships for their people, so that they were unaware of their habitations.
He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and your Lord is not unaware of what you do.
Your Lord is the Lord of Mercy. If He wills, He will remove you, and He will remove you from the earth, and He made you successors in the land.
Verily, you are the promise of that which you are threatened.
Say: "O my people! Act according to your ability. I shall know that you will know the Day of Resurrection, and you will know the truth."
And He hath produced for you the cattle and the cattle, and they say: "This is what Allah has forbidden us." They say: "Allah has forbidden us." They say: "This is that which Allah has promised us." They are the ones who do not know that which they say.
