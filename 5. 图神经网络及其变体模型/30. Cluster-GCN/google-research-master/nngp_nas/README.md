# Towards NNGP-guided Neural Architecture Search

## Overview
This directory contains the publicly available [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/nngp_nas/NNGP_on_NASBench101.ipynb) for the paper:

[**Towards NNGP-guided Neural Architecture Search**](
https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06006).

Daniel S. Park*, Jaehoon Lee*, Daiyi Peng, Yuan Cao, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein (2020).

\* denotes equal contribution.

## Available Features

With this notebook you will be able to:

* Compute the NNGP validation accuracy of a NAS-Bench-101 model on (a subset of) CIFAR-10.
* Compute metrics introduced in the paper to evaluate the quality of performance predictors including:
  * Kendall's Tau
  * Correlation Coefficient
  * Prediction Quality for Exceedance of Threshold Performance (PQETP)
  * Discovered Performance
