However, the percentage of consumer offerings was likely lower as passenger car counts may include microvans, tiny commercial vehicles that are popular in China.	但該客用產品占比可能高估，因為數字可能包括在中國的熱門車種廂型小車和小型商用車。
Between 1978-1985 alongside the market-based Chinese economic reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping, Dongfeng was transformed from a manufacturer of two heavy-duty trucks with fragmented operations and ownership into a single, centrally managed enterprise.	在 1978－1985 年鄧小平推動的中國市場經濟改革中，東風從營運和所有權混亂的兩款重型卡車製造廠，轉變成單一、中央管控的企業。

Post-1985, further reforms took place that allowed Dongfeng greater autonomy; the company was removed from the direct administrative control of the central government.	1985 年後發動更大的改革，使東風更能自主；該公司不再受中央政府直接管理。
By the mid-1980s, its assets had tripled from those initially given to it by the state in 1981, and management was desirous of even greater production capacity.	1980 年代中期，和 1981 年國家撥付的資產相比增為三倍，管理層也想要將產量再次擴大。
But in 1995, the company was experiencing financial difficulties as was the case with many Chinese automobile manufacturers at this time.	但於 1995 年，該公司和許多中國的汽車公司相同，都發生財務困難。
The situation was still dire in 1998 precipitating a 1999 restructuring of the company.	慘況持續到 1998 年，導致該公司於 1999 年進行重整。
This state owned enterprise has come into conflict with authority at both the national and provincial levels.	國營企業面對國家與省級政府時會有衝突。

As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, "Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve".	屠在計畫研討會上演說時，有人說她的演說就像 1,600 年一本醫書的標題「肘後備急方」的標題一樣。
At first, it was ineffective because they extracted it with traditional boiling water.	一開始，因為團隊以傳統滾水法來萃取，因此無效。
Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant; Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong, which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.	屠呦呦發現，以低溫萃取程序，可以從植物中分離出有效的抗瘧成分；屠說，這是受到由葛洪於西元 340 年撰寫的傳統草藥緊急處方醫書的影響，書中說這種草藥必須以冷水浸泡。
This book contained the direction to immerse a handful of qinghao in the equivalent of two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all.	該書中的處方指出，以一把青蒿泡在約 2 公升水中，擰出汁液並全部飲下。
After rereading the recipe, Tu realised the hot water had already damaged the active ingredient in the plant; therefore she proposed a method using low-temperature ether to extract the effective compound instead.	讀過這個處方後，屠了解到熱水會破壞該植物的有效成分，因此她提議替代方案，以低溫乙醚來萃取出有效成分。
The animal tests showed it was completely effective in mice and monkeys.	以老鼠和猴子進行的動物測試，證明這種方法完全有效。

Tu's group first determined the chemical structure of artemisinin.	屠的團隊首度確定了青蒿素的化學結構。
In 1973, Tu wanted to confirm the carbonyl group in the artemisinin molecule, therefore she accidentally synthesized dihydroartemisinin.	1973 年，屠想要確認青蒿素分子中的羰基團，因此在無意間合成雙氫青素。
Furthermore, Tu volunteered to be the first human subject.	此外，屠也志願當做人體實驗第一名受試者。
"As head of this research group, I had the responsibility" she said.	她說，「身為研究團隊之首，我責無旁貸。」
It was safe, so she conducted successful clinical trials with human patients.	新藥是安全的，因此她也成功完成新藥的病患治療試驗。

Tu is regarded as the "Three-Without Scientist" – no postgraduate degree (there was no postgraduate education then in China), no study or research experience abroad, and not a member of either the Chinese national academies, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering.	屠被稱為「三無科學家」－沒有博士學位（當時中國沒有博士學程）、未曾出國深造，也不是任何中國國家級研究機構的成員，如中國科學院或中國工程院院士。

The airport was built in 1936 during Japanese rule with its origins as a Japanese military airbase, the Taihoku Airfield (Japanese: 臺北飛行場 Hepburn: Taihoku Hikōjō), also known as Matsuyama Airfield (松山飛行場).	本機場建於1936年的日本統治時期，原為日本空軍機場，當時稱為台北飛行場，又稱松山飛行場。
After World War II, in 1946, it was taken over by the Republic of China Air Force.	二次世界大戰之後的1946年，由中華民國空軍取得。
Before the end of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the airport provided flight routes between Shanghai and Taipei, occasionally via Fuzhou.	在中國內戰結束、中華人民共和國政府成立之前，該機場提供台北上海航線，有時也飛往福州。
Shared military and civilian use—both domestic and international—began on 16 April 1950 in the reconstructed Civil Aeronautics Administration Taipei Airport (交通部民用航空局台北航空站).	1950年4月16日起，改組的交通部民用航空局台北航空站，將該機場設為軍事與民航兩用， 包括國內與國際航線。
Domestic destinations have been Kaohsiung, Hualien, Taichung, Penghu, and Tainan.	國內航線曾包括高雄、花蓮、台中、澎湖與台南航線。
The first international destinations were Seattle, Tokyo, Pusan, Manila, Bangkok, and Hong Kong.	最初開始飛行的國際航線包括西雅圖、 東京、釜山、馬尼拉、曼谷、香港。
The first international airlines included Northwest Airlines, Pan American Airlines, and Hong Kong Airways (now Cathay Pacific).	最初的國際航空公司包括西北航空、泛美航空、香港航空（現在的國泰航空）。
Later, the airport became too small to handle an increased number of passengers, even after a series of expansions.	之後， 即使在歷經幾次擴建之後， 該機場還是太小而無法容納增加的旅客。
This later worsened when new wide-body jets became common at the airport.	之後該機場的廣體客機增加， 情況更為惡化。
Therefore, all international activities were relocated to Taoyuan International Airport (then known as Chiang Kai-shek International) after its inauguration on 26 February 1979.	因此，所有國際航班都轉移到於1979年2月26日啟用的桃園國際機場（當時稱做中正國際機場）。
Consequently, the passenger load at the airport dropped from 6.2 million in 1978 to 2.9 million in 1979 (a 53% decrease).	此後該機場的乘客容量從1978年的6,200,000人，降到1979年的2,900,000人（下降53%）。
At its peak in 1997, the airport handled over 15.3 million passengers annually.	1997年該機場的乘客人數達到高峰， 一年超過1,530萬人。
Service to Taichung and Chiayi was stopped in mid-2007 after the load factor dropped significantly due to Taiwan High Speed Rail start of revenue service in January 2007.	2007年1月台灣高鐵開始商業營運之後，由於往台中與嘉義的乘客人數大幅下降，這兩條航線於2007年中停止服務。
Passenger volume decreased from 6.7 million in 2006 to 4.4 million in 2007 (a 34% decrease).	乘客人數自2006年的6,700,000下降到2007年的4,400,000（下降34%）。
Also due to the opening of the high speed rail line, on 1 March 2008, Uni Air suspended its service to Kaohsiung, while Far Eastern Air Transport suspended its service to Tainan.	同時在高鐵開始營運的影響下， 2008年3月1日起，立榮航空停止飛往高雄的服務，遠東航空則停止飛往台南的服務。
TransAsia Airways decided to stop flights to Tainan and Kaohsiung after 1 August 2008.	復興航空則決定自2008年8月1日起，停止飛航台南與高雄。
In early 1999 when the construction of Taipei 101 had just started, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration changed this airport's certain SID and STAR procedures to avoid possible collision with the building.	1999年初當台北101開始興建時，台灣民用航空局改變機場的某些 SID 與 STAR 程序， 避免可能的撞擊事件。
The 677-meter Fuxing North Road Underground Passage (復興北路車行地下道) was constructed between 1997 and 2006 under this airport's runway to link the north and south side of this airport.	677公尺長的復興北路車行地下道，於1997到2006年之間在機場跑道下方施工，以聯通該機場的南端和北端。

Then-mayor Ma Ying-jeou had been pressing to make Songshan Airport Taipei's main International terminal, citing that its location close to the city center would make it preferable for business travelers.	剈市長馬英九曾經推動松山機場成為台北主要的國際機場，因為該機場靠近台北市中心，對商務旅客來說非常方便。
However, building height restrictions around the airport raised concerns about flight safety, blocking of radio communications, noise pollution, and a reduced number of flights.	然而， 機場附近的建築線高造成諸如飛航安全問題、 無線電通訊阻擾、 噪音污染， 必須減少航班。
The continuing growth of Taipei City means that Songshan airport is situated in the heart of downtown Taipei.	台北市區的不斷成長，也使得松山機場所在地變成台北市中心區域。
Compared to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Songshan Airport saves travelers about 30 minutes due to its location inside Taipei City's central business district, but the city suffers from the noise, pollution, restrictions on urban planning, and traffic congestion the airport brings about.	和台灣桃園國際機場相比，松山機場讓旅客節省約30分鐘，因為他就正在市區正中心的商業區；但是機場也為台北市帶來噪音、污染、 都市計劃限制和交通擁擠等問題。
In the 2002 and 2006 Taipei Mayor Election DPP candidates Lee Ying-yuan and Frank Hsieh both proposed the plan to close Songshan Airport, and developed its land into road, huge park, detention basin and sports arena, since the Taiwan High Speed Rail could quickly take up the traffic load between Taipei and western Taiwan cities, and the remaining service to outlying islands and eastern Taiwan could be easily taken over by the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after the completion of Taoyuan International Airport Access MRT System by the end of 2016.	2002年與2006年，民進黨的台北市長候選人李應元與謝長廷，兩人都主張關閉松山機場，將其用地發展為道路、大型公園、 滯洪池與運動區， 因為台灣高鐵可以快速承擔台北到其他台灣西部城市的交通，而在桃園國際機場捷運在2016年底完成之後，松山機場剩餘的功能，包括飛往離島與台灣東部，可以由台灣桃園國際機場取代。
Also, the MRT system will make the international potential of Songshan airport less attractive.	同時，機場捷運也會讓松山機場的國際航線功能變得比較沒有吸引力。
The Songshan Airport closing proposal was deferred under the Taipei City Government which has long been dominated by the Pan-Blue Coalition, who prefers the downtown airport connection concept with Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo.	長期由泛藍陣營執政的台北市政府，則反對關閉松山機場的提案， 他們比較偏好以市區機場連接上海、首爾、東京的構想。
Due to the introduction of Taiwan-China flights and future international potential, the airport is undergoing extensive renovations, the first phase of which is expected to be completed by October 2010.	由於導入台灣中國直飛航線以及未來國際航線的需求，該機場正在進行大規模的改建，第一期預計在2010年10月前完成。

On 29 March 2011, the renovated Terminal 2 was re-opened to handle domestic flights.	2011年3月29日，重新改建的第二航廈重新開幕，供國內航線使用。
Songshan Airport is seen to have the potential to attract business travelers within Pacific Asia due to its location in downtown Taipei.	松山機場因為位於台北市區，對於亞太區的商務旅客相當有吸引力。
Flights to Bangkok–Don Mueang, Jakarta–Halim Perdanakusuma, Kuala Lumpur–Subang, Singapore–Seletar, Nagoya–Komaki, Osaka–Itami, Seoul–Gimpo, Shanghai–Hongqiao, Beijing–Nanyuan, and Tokyo–Haneda are especially attractive since these airports are also in the central areas of their respective cities, and all these cities have larger far flung international airports.	飛往曼谷廊曼、 雅加達哈林帕達納克蘇瑪國際機場、吉隆坡梳邦機場、 新加坡實里達機場、 名古屋小牧機場、 大阪伊丹機場、 首爾金浦機場、上海虹橋機場，北京南苑機場、東京羽田機場的航班特別受歡迎， 因為這些機場都位在市中心， 在較遠的郊區有更大的國際機場。

In the aftermath of the Japanese threat, Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang visited Moscow in 1896 and signed a secret treaty with Russian foreign minister Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, allowing Imperial Russia to build a Russian gauge railway in Manchuria, which opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of another lease convention in 1898, effectively allowing Russia to annex Port Arthur in all but name.	在日本威脅之後，清朝總督李鴻章於1896年訪問了莫斯科，並與俄羅斯外交部長阿列克謝・洛巴諾夫-羅斯托夫斯基簽署密約，允許俄羅斯帝國在滿洲建造一條俄羅斯軌距鐵路，這為1898年以另一項租賃公約的形式進一步的俄羅斯擴張主義打開了大門，讓俄羅斯除了名義上以外，完全有效吞併旅順口區。
However, after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Russian forces used the anti-foreigner insurgency as a pretext to formally invade and occupied most of Manchuria, and Mukden became a Russian stronghold in the Far East with the building of the South Manchurian Railway.	然而，1900年義和團之亂後，俄羅斯軍隊以對抗外國入侵為藉口，正式入侵佔領了滿洲大部分地區，隨著南滿鐵路的建設， 瀋陽成為俄羅斯在遠東的據點。

British and US reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Northeast China and Eastern Inner Mongolia region looted and terrorized the people of Shenyang, and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage".	英國和美國的報告指出，佔領東北和內蒙古東部地區的蘇聯軍隊，對 瀋陽居民進行搶劫和恐嚇，蘇聯當局沒有阻止連續「三天的強姦掠奪」。
The Soviets were replaced by the Nationalist Chinese, who were flown in on U.S. transport planes.	蘇聯被乘坐美國運輸機的國民黨軍取代。
During the Chinese Civil War, Shenyang remained a Kuomintang stronghold from 1946 to 1948, although the Chinese communists controlled the surrounding countryside.	在中國內戰期間，瀋陽從1946年到1948年一直是國民黨的據點，不過中國共產黨控制了周圍的農村。
It was captured by the communists on October 30, 1948, following a series of offensives known as the Liaoshen Campaign.	在一連串稱作遼西會戰的攻擊後，共產黨於1948年10月30日佔領瀋陽。
Over the past 200 years or so, Shenyang managed to grow and increase its industrial might, despite consecutive wars with Russia and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second World War, and China's Civil War (Shenyang became the main battleground between the Communists and Nationalists).	在過去的200年左右的時間裡，儘管在19世紀末和20世紀初與俄羅斯和日本連續發生戰爭，又歷娙第二次世界大戰和中國內戰（瀋陽成為共產黨和國民黨間的主要戰場），瀋陽還是設法增長並強化其工業實力。
The old city of Shenyang resided almost entirely within the modern day Shenhe District, and used to have two city walls.	瀋陽舊城幾乎完全居於在當代的瀋河區，曾有兩道城牆。
Situated roughly within the area bounded by the four "Shuncheng" (顺城; 'along the city walls') roads/streets in Shenhe District, the (now-demolished) square-shaped inner city wall marked the bounds of ancient Shenyang.	（現已拆除的）方形內城牆，大致位於瀋河區四條「順城」道路/街道的範圍內，代表著舊時瀋陽的邊界。
The earliest wall was built in 926 during early Liao dynasty to settle Northern Song civilians the Khitans abducted from raids to use as slave labourers, and was then made of rammed earth because the city was merely a small settlement at the time (historically the administrative center of the Liaodong region was at Liaoyang).	最早的城牆建於926年，在遼朝早期，用於安置由契丹人突襲中綁架而來的北宋居民，用作奴工；城牆由夯土製成，因為當時這座城市只是一個小據點（歷史上，遼東地區的行政中心在遼陽）。
However, in 1368, Hongwu Emperor of the newly founded Ming dynasty ordered a new regional military command—the Liaodong Regional Military Commission (遼東都指揮使司)—to be established, and Shenyang was made a prominent regional "guard town" (衛所).	然而，1368年，新建國的明朝洪武皇帝，下令成立一個新的地區軍事指揮部——遼東都指揮使司，瀋陽成為一個著名的區域衛所。
In 1388, Min Zhong (閔忠), the newly appointed city commissioner of the Shenyang Central Guard, wrote to Hongwu Emperor immediately upon his tenure requesting permission to upgrade the city wall, and the old wall was made taller and thoroughly reinforced with overlaid bricks.	1388年，瀋陽中央衛隊新任命的行政首長閔忠，在上任後立即上書給洪武皇帝，請求准許升級城牆，舊城牆變得更高，並以磚塊覆蓋徹底加固。
According to History of Ming, the reconstructed Ming-era wall was 2.5 zhàngs (8 metres or 26 feet) tall, more than 1 zhàng (3.2 metres or 10.5 feet) wide at the top, and 9 lis and 30 bus (about 5.2 kilometres or 3.2 miles) long.	根據明朝歷史，重建的明代城牆高2.5丈（8米或26英尺），頂部寬超過1丈（3.2米或10.5英尺），長9里和30步（約5.2公里或3.2英里）。
It has two layers of moats dug outside, each being 3 zhàngs (9.6 metres or 31.5 feet) wide and 8 chis (2.56 metres or 8 feet 4.8 inches) deep, fed with water from Shen River.	城外挖了兩層護城河，每層寬3丈（9.6米或31.5英尺），深8丈（2.56米或8英尺4.8英寸），灌入瀋河的水。
There were four city gates, each at the center of one side, connected by two main roads that intersected at Central Temple of the city's center in a "+" fashion.	有四個城門，每道城門都在一邊的中心點，由兩條主要道路相連；兩條主要道路以「+」的方式在市中心的中央寺廟交會。
This Ming wall was heavily damaged in 1625 after the Manchu laid siege and captured the city, with only the north wall and gate (which had undergone reinforcing reconstructions in 1545 under the orders of Jiajing Emperor) remained intact.	1625年滿洲人包圍並佔領該市後，這堵明城牆嚴重受損，只有北牆和大門（在嘉靖皇帝命令下，在1545年進行強化重建）完好無損。
The Manchu leader Nurhachi however saw the strategic value of the city, and decided to formally relocate his Later Jin capital from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and ordered the city wall to be rebuilt.	然而，滿族領袖努爾哈赤看出這座城市的戰略價值，決定將金朝首都從遼陽正式遷至瀋陽，並下令重建城牆。
According to Annals of Mukden (盛京通志), the new city wall was a standard black brick wall standing at a height of 3.5 zhàngs (about 12.5 metres or 41.0 feet), a width of 1.8 zhàngs (about 6.4 metres or 21.0 feet) and a total length of 9 lis and 332 bus (about 6.4 kilometres or 4.0 miles) long, complete with 12 towers (8 gate and 4 corner) and a 14.5 zhàngs (about 52-metre or 171-foot) wide moat.	根據《盛京通志》，新城牆是一堵標準的黑磚牆，高度為3.5 丈（約12.5米或41.0英尺），寬度為1.8 丈（約6.4米或21.0英尺），總長度為9 里 332 步（約6.4公里或4.0英里），配有12座塔樓（8個大門和4個角落），護城河寬 14.5 丈（約52米或171英尺）。
The city gates were increased from four to eight, though the old Ming-era north gate and tower was preserved but sealed shut, later known as the "Ninth Gate" (九門).	後城門從四個增加到八個，儘管古老的明時代北門和塔樓保留下來，但密封關閉，後來稱為「九門」。
The outer city wall, called the "peripheral wall" (邊牆; Biān Qiáng) or "pass wall" (關牆; Guān Qiáng), was actually a rammed earth rampart built in 1680 to expand the urban area outside the inner city.	外城牆稱為「邊牆」或「關牆」，實際上是一座建於1680年的夯土牆，旨在將城區擴及內城之外。
It was almost round in shape, standing at a height of 7.5 chis (around 2.7 metres or 8 feet 10.3 inches) and an overall length of 32 lis and 24 bus (about 20.7 kilometres or 12.9 miles), and also had eight gates known as the "peripheral gates" (邊門; Biān Mén).	它大致是圓形的，高度為7.5尺（約2.7米或8英尺10.3英寸），總長度為32英里24步（約20.7公里或12.9英里），還有8個被稱為「邊門」。
The corresponding inner and outer gates were linked by roads that intersected within the inner city in a "#" pattern around the Mukden Palace.	對應的內門和外門之間，連結有在城內交叉的道路，在瀋陽故宮周圍以「#」圖案交叉。
Nearly all of these city walls and gates were demolished after 1949.	所有的城牆和城門，在1949年後幾乎都被摧毁。
Two gates and one corner tower of the inner wall were rebuilt during the 1990s.	1990年代， 內城牆有兩個城門和一個角落的塔樓重建起來。
There had, however, been proposals to rebuild the other gates and towers in preparation to the 12th National Games in 2013.	然而，有人提議重建其他大門和塔樓，為2013年 中華人民共和國第12屆運動會做準備。
Around 2.5 km (1.6 mi) outside Shenyang's former outer wall, there were four pagodas each located within an associated Tibetan buddhist temple, namely the East Pagoda in Yongguang Temple (永光寺), the South Pagoda in Guangci Temple (廣慈寺), the West Pagoda in Yanshou Temple (延壽寺) and the North Pagoda in Falun Temple (法輪寺).	在瀋陽舊外牆外約2.5公里（1.6英里），有四座寶塔，各自位於相關的藏傳佛教寺內，即永光寺的東塔、廣慈寺的南塔、延壽寺的西塔和法輪寺的北塔。
They were built in 1643 and completed in 1645.	這些寶塔於1643年開始興建，於1645年完成。
The four pagodas are identical white Buddha-stupas as tall as 26 m (85 ft).	這四座寶塔是相同的白色佛像，高達26米（85英尺）。
Nowadays only the temple for the North Pagoda is well preserved, the East and South has only the pagodas left, and the temple for the West Pagoda was rebuilt in 1998.	如今，只有北塔的寺廟保存完好，東邊和南邊只剩下寶塔，西塔的寺廟於1998年重建。
Both the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth were also to be found in the old city during the Qing dynasty.	清朝期間，在舊城區也有天壇和地壇。
They were smaller replicas of Beijing's counterparts.	其為北京天壇地壇的縮小版。
Neither exists today.	今日都不復存。

The central urban area is surrounded by three artificial rivers—respectively the South Canal (南运河) from the south and southeast, the Xinkai River (新开河, formerly the North Canal) from the north and northeast, and the Weigong River (卫工河, formerly the Weigong Nullah) from the west, all interconnected by channels as a continuous waterway.	城市中心被三條人工開挖的河流包圍——分別是南面、東南面的南運河、北面和東北面的新開河（前北運河）和西邊的衛工明渠，彼此相連為一條連續的水道。
The South Canal in particular, famous for the series of linear parks and gardens along it, was constructed upon the old course of the Wanquan River (萬泉河; 'ten thousand springs river'), historically also called the Little Shen River (小瀋水) or Wuli River (五里河; 'five-li river'), which was a principal water source for the old city.  These are reinforced on the peripheries by smaller rivers such as Xi River (细河), Puhe River (蒲河) and Mantang River (满堂河), and drains into the Hun River at three different locations on the southeast, due south and southwest side of the city.	特別是南運河，以其沿線的成排公園和花園而聞名，建在萬泉河的舊河道上，歷史上也被稱為小瀋河或五里河，是舊城區的主要水源。外側有細河、普河和曼塘河（曼塘河）等較小的河流，在該市的東南側和西南側三個不同位置匯入渾河。
There was also previously another canal on the east side called Huishan Nullah (辉山明渠) that drains into Xinkai River's lower section, but is now no longer existent due to land reclamation from urban constructions.	以前，東側還有一條名為輝山明渠的運河，流入新開河下段，但由於城市建設的土地開墾，現在已經不復存在。
Shenyang has many parks, among the most famous are the 14.5 km (9.0 mi) South Canal Linear Parks (南运河带状公园) situated along the homonymous river traversing the southern parts of Dadong, Shenhe and Heping District, covering an area of approximately 1,400,000 m² (350 acres).	瀋陽有許多公園，其中最著名的是14.5公里（9.0英里）的南運河帶狀公園，位於穿越大東區、瀋河區和和平區南側的同名河流沿線，面積約為140萬平方米（350英畝）。
