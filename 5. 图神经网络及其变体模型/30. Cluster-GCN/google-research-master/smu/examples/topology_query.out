Molecules can have multiple bond topologies that match the geometry
(see multiple_bond_topology.py for some illustration)
This is what the "find_by_smiles" method is using and is very efficient
Note that we have multiple criteria for creating bond topologies.
For this example, we will focus on the DDT criteria (our initial bond ranges)
find_by_smiles on [O-]N=N[NH+]=[N+]([O-])F finds these molecule ids
[85532001, 88595001, 89347002]

But you can modify the allowed distances for each type of bond
and find all molecules which match a given topology with these modifications
While this does not have the read the whole database, it is a much less efficient operation than querying by smiles, so only use it if you modify the allowed distances

First you have to load the default bond lengths

You then provide the desired topology as a SMILES string
The topology query without modifying bond lengths, finds the same result
Unmodified find_by_topology finds these molecule ids
[85532001, 88595001, 89347002]

We now modify the bond lengths by allowing N to N bonds of any order
to be between 1A and 2A with the string "N~N:1.0-2.0"
We now find these molecule ids
[85532001, 88595001, 88595005, 89158002, 89158006, 89347002, 89347004, 89351001, 89351002]

Also note that the bond_topo field of all molecules returned
from a topology query have been modified with the new allowed bond distances

Compare the bond topologies from the orignal query:
    85532001 has bond topologies: [85227, 85532, 88595, 89158, 89347]
    88595001 has bond topologies: [85227, 85532, 88595, 89158, 89347]
    89347002 has bond topologies: [85227, 85532, 88595, 89158, 89347]

With the topologies from the query with modified bond distances:
