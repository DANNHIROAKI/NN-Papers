# Representation Clustering

This repository contains code for evaluating clustering of neural network
representation spaces. It was written by [Thao Nguyen](https://thaonguyen19.github.io/)
when she was a student researcher.

This code depends on [breeds_helpers.py](https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness/blob/master/robustness/tools/breeds_helpers.py) from the [robustness library](https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness/blob/master/robustness) and also expects that the BREEDS hierarchy files from [here](https://github.com/MadryLab/BREEDS-Benchmarks/tree/master/imagenet_class_hierarchy/modified) have been placed in a subdirectory of the directory that contains the source files named `breeds`.
