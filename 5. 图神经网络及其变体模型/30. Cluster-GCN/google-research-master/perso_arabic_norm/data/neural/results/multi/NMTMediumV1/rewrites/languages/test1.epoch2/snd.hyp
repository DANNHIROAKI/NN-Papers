And He is He Who has decreed the angels, and He will raise you from your Lord, and He calls you to die, and when he comes to Us, and they will not be able.

And do not see those who disbelieve in Our verses, when they turn away from you, they turn away from you, and if you turn away, you would not have seen the unjust of the evildoers.
And those who do not believe in the way of the world, but that that that they may be a lesson.
And do not make the People of the Book, and the earth, and the sport, and the life of the life of the life of this world, and that which you may warn the Day of Resurrection, and the Day of Resurrection will be a ransom of the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will not be able for them, and Allah will not guide any guardian, nor He will be a painful punishment.
Say: "Shall I show you to whom He wills, or He will harm to us, or He will harm to us, and we will bring you from the way of the land, and we will not be raised to you?"
