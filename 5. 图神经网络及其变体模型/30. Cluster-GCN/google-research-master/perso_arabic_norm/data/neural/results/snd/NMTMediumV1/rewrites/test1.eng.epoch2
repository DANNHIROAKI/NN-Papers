“And We have made for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul, as if he should be killed in the land, as if he had killed him, as if he had killed him, as if he had saved him from the life of the world, and he saved him from the dead, and after them came clear proofs.”
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides, and they should be imprisoned in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.

Those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) and do good (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and spend in the cause of those who are patient (in the Oneness of Allah), then judge between them with them, and turn away from them, and turn away from them, and if you turn back (against them), then judge between them with justice; surely Allah loves those who do good.
And what is the matter for you that they have been given you to judge in the Book of God, and then they turn back after it, and they are not believers?

And let them judge between what has been revealed to them, and do not follow their hearts, lest you turn away from what has been sent down to you from what has been sent down to you from you. But if they turn back, Allah will forgive them for their sins, and most of them are transgressors.

And most of them see many of them, and in the sight of the wicked, and in the cause of the unlawful, and in the least, they shall be an evil evil.
How do they have forbidden the truth and the unlawful of their own hands, and what is evil for them?
And the Jews say: 'Allah is the enemy of Allah." They will be with their own souls, their hands, their hands, they are not with their own souls, they are not in their hands, but they will not be pleased with each other, but they will not be pleased with each other, but they will not be pleased with their own hands.

Those who say, “The Jews are the ones who are the ones who have no other than Allah." They will not bear any other than Allah. Say, "Do not follow any other than Allah.”
Why do they not turn back to Allah and His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a messenger, before him, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, and that they may see it. See how they are deluded away.

“And those who did not have forbidden any other than those who have wronged others, and what they used to do.
See how many of you see those who disbelieve, those who disbelieve, and those who have been sent before them will have a evil punishment, and they will abide in the punishment of Allah.

God has not taken a dream, nor a soothsayer, nor a soothsayer, nor a witness, nor a witness, and most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, “Come to what God has sent down, and to the Messenger," they say: "Enough for us is that which we found our fathers, but if their fathers had no knowledge, and they will not be guided.”
O you who believe! you are your friends, so that you may be guided; but whoever does not follow your own desires, he will surely mislead you from your own error; then Allah will inform you what you will.
O you who believe! if you die in your death, then you will be two more than the two parties of you, and you will be in the cause of your religion, or you will be in the land.

But if you know that those who are guilty of the two parties of those who are guilty of the other, they will be two of those who are among the two of those who are among the two of them, and they swear by Allah, and they swear by Allah that they are not our testimony.
It is easy that they should be a witness to the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of the testimony of Allah. And Allah does not guide the people.

And when I said to the disciples, 'Believe in Me and My Messenger, and they said: ‘We believe and bear witness that we are Muslims.”
“And when the disciples said, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, has your Lord sent down to us a table from heaven?”
They said: "We desire that we may be put out of our hearts, and our hearts, and our hearts, and we know that you are witnesses.”
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "Our Lord, send down from us a table from heaven, and bring us from the first of the first of us, and bring us from the first of the first of us, and give us sustenance from your Lord.
He said, “I am sent to you, and I will punish you, and I will punish you with a severe punishment, and I will not punish any of the people.”
And when Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Worship me and my mother?" He will say, "You have submitted my trust and my mother." He will say, "You are not my own, and I will know you." And he will say, "I know what is in your heart. You know what is in your hearts. You know not what is in your hearts. You know all things."
I said to them, "Worship me except what I command me, so worship Him, my Lord, your Lord, your Lord, your Lord, your Lord and your Lord, I have created them over them, and You are the Watcher of all things.”
If you punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say: “This is the Day of Resurrection, that which is with them, and that which is with them shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide therein, and they shall abide therein, and they shall be pleased therein.”

All praise belongs to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and the stars, and the light, and the light, and the light of the Lord.

He is God in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you do.
There is no sign to them from their Lord, but they turn away from them.
And when the truth came to them, they belied the truth, and when they were heedless of what they used to mock.

And if We had sent down to you a Book in a book, they would have touched their hands, and they would have touched their hands, and they said: This is naught but obvious sorcery.
And they say, "Why has not been sent down to him? Had we had sent down the Qur'an, we would certainly have been given it, but they would not have respite.”
And if We had sent him as a human being, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would have made them as a single nation.
And before you (O Muhammad), the Messengers before you, and those who scoffed with them were used to ridicule them.
Say, "Travel in the land and see what is the end of those who disbelieve.”
Ask them, "Who is in the heavens and the earth? Say: 'This is Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Day of Judgment, the Day of Judgment, that you will not believe in the Day of Resurrection?”
To Him belongs the day and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

Say, "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of the Day of Judgment.”
On the day when it had been averted from the Day of Judgment, Allah has shown mercy to him, and that is the supreme achievement.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, there is none other than Him; and if He touches you, He has power over all things.
He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Say: “What is this is greater than this, say: ‘Say, ‘I am witness with you, and I am witness of you, and I am the witness of you." Say, "This is the truth, and I am commanded to say to you, ‘Do you not believe in Allah?" Say: "I am the One who is with you." Say: "I am not a witness to you." Say: "I am the One who is with you, and I am the One who created you.”
“Those who have given the Book to understand, they will recognize their children, and they will not believe in themselves.
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah, or denies His revelations, or who is not unjust?
And (remember) when We will gather the Day of Resurrection when We will say to those who say: "Where are your associates (false deities)?"
And they will not say to them, "By Allah, we are not with those who worship Him.”
See what they used to lie against themselves, and if they were liars.
And some of them will listen to you, and their hearts, and their hearts, and their hearts, and deafness in their hearts, and deafness not in their ears; and if they see them, they will not believe in you, and say to them: 'This is nothing but the ancients."
And those who go astray from themselves, and from their backs, they will be their backs, and they do not know except themselves.
And if you could see those who disbelieve in the fire, they will say: "If we had been returned to you, then we would certainly have rejected our Lord, and we would not be believers.”
Nay, those who were before the past before what they had done before them, and if they were returned to it, then they would have been made to make it as it, and they will surely be returned to it.
And they say: "There is nothing but this life, and we shall not be raised again.”
And if you could see when they will see your Lord, he will say, "Is it not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, this is not the truth." They will say, "Yes, by your Lord, the punishment of your Lord."
Those who disbelieve in the meeting of Allah, and when they come to the Hour, they will say, "We have done what is on us." They will say, "We have done what we have done, and their backs will be done.”
The life of this world is nothing but the life of this world and the Hereafter; and those who fear the Hereafter are the best of the Hereafter.
Verily, we know that they will say, "You will not grieve," they say, "you are not the ones who disbelieve."
“And before you, Messengers, the Messengers, the Messengers, they were patient, and they were patient until they were patient.
And if you turn away from them, then, if you have a tunnel on the earth or the earth, or if it comes to them, then bring them a sign, or bring them a sign, and if Allah had willed, He would certainly have guided all of them.
Those who listen to the word of Allah will be called to Him, and to Him will be the Day of Resurrection, and will be returned to the Day of Resurrection.
And they say, "Why has not been sent down to him from his Lord? Say: 'This is not a sign from Allah, and most of them do not know.”
And there is no creature on the earth, nor the birds, nor the birds, and the birds, like you are like you, and We have no share in the Book.
And those who reject Our revelations, and are deaf in the sight of the earth, and whoever turns astray from the earth, Allah will surely guide whom He pleases.
Say, "Have you considered the punishment of Allah, then the Hour of the Hour or the Hour or the Hour, then will you call upon Him?
Nay, but if you call (to Him), He will call upon you, and if He wills, He will call you to you, and you will remember Him.
And indeed We sent Messengers before you, and We seized them with distress, so that they might humble them.
And when Our punishment came to them, then did they not see their hearts, their hearts, their hearts, their hearts, and their hearts, and what they were doing?
And when they forgot the reminder when they forgot them, We will gather them with every gate, and We drowned them with what they had done, and when they were in the end.
And the people of the wrong-doers, the people of the people, and all praise, and all praise is to the Lord of the worlds.
Say: "Have you considered Allah, if He has made your hearing and your eyes, and your eyes, and your hearts, and your hearts, and your hearts, and that He will bring you out of what He will?"
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered that if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly or openly, you will not be destroyed except the wrongdoers?”
“And We send messengers and givers of good news, and to warn, and those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.”

Say: "I do not say to you, 'I am not the treasures of Allah, and I do not know what is in the Unseen, nor do I say to you, 'I am the angel, and I will not follow any other than what I have revealed to me. Say, 'Do not be like the right, and you will not be able to do so.”
And do not warn those who fear your Lord with fear, and do not have any power with them, except Allah, and that they may be godfearing.
And call not upon those who call their Lord by night and evening, seeking not for those who invoke their Lord, nor do not turn away from them, nor will they grieve.
And We have made some of them some of them who say: "Is it not a people who have been among us?" And God does not know those who do not know.
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say, "Peace be upon you, your Lord, your Lord, His mercy has mercy upon you, so that you may repent and repent after that, and thereafter, He is Forgiving, Merciful.”
And remember how We make the Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, lessons, lessons, lessons, lessons, revelations, etc.), and it is clear to them (the wrong).
Say: “I have been forbidden to invoke those who invoke Allah, and say, 'I am not my own desires. Say, 'I have no right to follow my religion, and I will not be guided.”
Say: "I have been clear to you from my Lord, and you disbelieve, and you disbelieve in that which you have done." Say, "This is not for Allah. He is the One Who has made the truth.”
Say, "If you were in the punishment of your Lord, I would certainly have been made to come to you, and you would have been judged in between you.”
And He is the King of the earth, that He knows not what is in the earth, and He knows what is in the earth, and He knows what is in the earth, and He knows not a leaf, nor is it in the earth, nor is it in the Book.
It is He Who makes you the night, and He is the One Who knows you, and He raises you to the day of the Day of Resurrection; then He raises you to the first term, then He will be returned to you, and He will inform you what you did.
And He is the One Who He sends down the Throne, and He sends you down from you, and when you die from you, then We will not kill you from the dead.
Then they will be returned to the truth of their God, and He is the One Who is with them, and He is the All-sufficient.
Say: "Who rescues you from the sea and the sea, when you call upon Him, and call upon Him, and call upon Him?" Say, "If we had been grateful, we will surely be of the thankful.”
Say: "Allah has forbidden you from all of you and from every distresses, then you are sincere.”
Say, "He will send you from your feet, or from your feet, or from your feet, or you will be made to make a party of you, or you will make some of you taste the violence of the people, and We will make you taste the signs.”
And your people were liars, and the truth is true. Say, "I am not a keeper over you."
Every time will come to you, and you will know.
And when you see those who dispute in Our signs, then turn away from them until they follow each other, and if you turn away, then, then, Satan will not make the wrong-doers.
And those who do not have the reward of their own (evil) deeds, they will have no reward; so that they may fear.
And (remember) those who have created the religion of a religion and a sport, and make them present in the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the world. And if they are not in the remembrance of the Qur'an, they will have no protector, and they will have no protector.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall we ask any other than Allah, Who does not benefit us nor does not harm us, and turn away from him, and then turn away from them?
“And (remember) when your prayer (prayer), and fear Him, and be careful to Him, and you will be gathered with Him.”
And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth, and the Day of Judgment, and the Day of Judgment, and the Day of Judgment, and it will be said to him, "Be," and it is the Day of Judgment; and He is the All-Wise, the Wise.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you worship Allah?" I will surely say to you, "I will see you and your people."

And his people said to him, “Do you dispute with me?" He said, “I am not my people, and I will follow you with what you associate with me. I will surely fear you with what you associate with Him." And He will not believe in all things.
“And how do you fear what you associate with Allah, and fear not the fear of Allah, and do not fear you with what you have sent down with you?

And Isma'il and Elisha, and Elisha, and Lot, and We gave him the inheritors.
