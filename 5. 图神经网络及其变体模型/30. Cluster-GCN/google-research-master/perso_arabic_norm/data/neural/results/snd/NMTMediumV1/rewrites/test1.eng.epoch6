The Beneficent, the Merciful, the Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Resurrection.
You worship Thee, and You are our helper.
Guide us to the straight path.
The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have incurred Your anger, nor of those who are astray.
Alif, Lam.
This is the Book, there is no doubt about it, the guidance of those who fear Allah.
Who believe in the unseen, and establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them.
And those who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and they are certain of the Hereafter.
They are on the right path from their Lord, and these are the successful.
As for those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a covering, and theirs is a great punishment.
And there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," but they are not believers.
They deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none but themselves, and they perceive not.
In their hearts is a disease disease, so Allah has increased their disease, and they will have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Do not make mischief on the earth,” they say, “We are only reformers.”
Indeed, they are the earth, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the fools have believed?"
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their devils, they say, "We are with you; we are with you."
Allah has cursed them, and they will fall in their rebellion in their rebellion.
They are the ones who have purchased error for guidance, so their commerce has not been lightened, nor are they guided.
Their parable is like the parable of the one who kindled a fire; then when it illuminated light around them, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness.
Deaf, dumb, dumb, and they will not return.
Or like a rain from the sky, wherein is darkness, and thunder and lightning, they hear their fingers in their ears; they put their fingers in their ears; and Allah encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning takes away from their eyes, and when it comes upon them, they fall down in it, and when it comes to them, they stand in it; and if Allah had willed, He could have opened their hearing and their sight; surely Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous.
Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the heaven as a canopy, and the sky, and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth therewith fruits for your sustenance; then do not set up rivals to Allah.
“And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a chapter of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.”
But if you do not, and you will never, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the unbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good works, for them are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; they shall say, "This is what we have been given before, and they shall be given a fruit, and they shall be given a new fruit."
God is not ashamed of the parable of a gnat or a gnat, but those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord; and those who disbelieve say, "This is what God has revealed," and those who disbelieve say, "This is what God has revealed, and He guides many of them.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and spread mischief in the land; these are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will give you life, then to Him you will be returned?
It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He established the heavens, then He made them seven heavens, and He knows all things.
When your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to make a vicegerent on earth,” they said, “Will you make it one who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, and we celebrate Your praise and extol Your holiness?” He said, “I know what you do not know.”
And He taught Adam the names of all things, then presented them before the angels, and said: "Tell Me the names of these if ye are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us; You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."
He said, “O Adam, inform them of their names.” When He told them of their names, He said, “Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and that which you reveal and what you reveal?”
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam", but they prostrated themselves except Iblis, and he refused to be of the unbelievers.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat of it wherever ye eat, and do not approach this tree, lest ye be among the wrongdoers.
Then Satan turned away from them, and caused them to go forth from their homes, and said: "Go forth from the land," and We said: "Go forth from one another." And for the earth there is a provision for you on earth and a provision.
Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord turned unto him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
We said: "Go forth from all of you, all of you, and if there comes to you Guidance from Me, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve."
And those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.
O Children of Israel! remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil My covenant with you, and I will fulfil My covenant with you, and fear Me alone.
And believe in that which I have sent down to you, confirming that which is with you, and be not the first of those who disbelieve, and do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear Me alone.
And do not confound the truth with falsehood, nor do you know what you know.
And establish prayer and give zakah, and bow with those who bow down.
So do you enjoin the people with good and forget yourselves? Then you recite the Book, and you do not understand.
And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humble.
Those who think that they will meet their Lord, and to Him will they return.
O Children of Israel! remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above the nations.
“Beware of the Day when no soul shall avail any one from another, nor any intercession shall be accepted from it, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall they be helped.”
And remember when We delivered you from Fir'awn's people, who were afflicting you with severe torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women. In that was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you, and We saved you and drowned the people of Fir'awn.
And when We took Moses for forty nights, then you took him from the calf, and you were unjust.
Then We pardoned you after that, so that you might be grateful.
And remember We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion that you might be guided.
And remember when Moses said to his people: "O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf, so turn your backs to your Maker, then turn away from your Maker. That is better for you. He has mercy on you, and He has mercy on you.
And when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly."
Then We raised you after your death, so that you might give thanks.
And We sent down upon you the clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails, saying: We have provided you with good things, and We have provided for you, and they wronged not.
And (remember) when We said, "Enter this city, and eat from it wherever you eat, and enter the gate, and say, 'We will forgive you your sins, and forgive you of your sins.'
But those who wronged (others) changed another word from the word of one another, and We sent down upon them a scourge from the sky because they were unjust.
And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, "Strike your staff with your staff." Then twelve springs gushed forth from them twelve springs; each people knew their drinking from Allah and do not act corruptly in the land, and do not act corruptly in the land.
And you said: "O Moses, we have no patience with you, we have no patience with our Lord, so pray for us from your Lord, the earth, its garlic, and its cucumbers, and the male and the female, and the male and the female, and the female, and the female, and the beasts, and the animals, and they do not have any power over you.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We took your covenant and raised above you the Mount (saying): “Hold fast to what We have given you and remember what is in it, so that you may guard (against evil).”
Then you turned back after that, and it was not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy.
And you knew those among you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath, so We said to them, "Be apes, despised."
So We made it a lesson for the people of the towns, and a lesson for them, and a lesson for those who fear Allah.
And when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow.” They said, “Are you mocking us?” They said, “I am the ignorant.”
They said, “Pray to your Lord to make plain to us what is like it.” Moses said, “It is not like a cow, nor is there a cow, nor a young man.”
They said, "Pray to your Lord for us to make plain to us what colour is like it." Moses said, "He is a yellow yellow cow."
They said, "Pray to your Lord for us to make plain to us what is like us; and if Allah wills, we will surely be guided."
Moses said: "He said: "It is not like a cow that is like a cow, nor a cow, nor the fields, nor the fields, nor any food." They said, "I have come to you." They said, "He has come to you, and they do not have any reason."
And when you killed a man, then you disputed about it, and Allah is with what you hide.
So We said: Strike the cow with the Strike (of the cow). Thus Allah brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs so that you may understand.
Then after that, your hearts are hardened, and they are harder as though they are harder, and that which rivers gush forth from beneath them. And there are many of them who have been watered with water, and some of them are covered by the fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Have you ever hope that you should obey Him as a party of them, while a party of them listened to the word of God, then they understood it, and they understood it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with each other, they say, "Do you inform them of what Allah has revealed to you?" They will say, "This is what Allah has revealed to you concerning your Lord."
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?
And among them are those who do not know the Book of the Book, but they do not know what they are, and they only conjecture.
So woe to those who write their hands to the Book, they say, "This is from Allah," so they say, "This is from Allah, so that they may have a small price, so woe for them for what they have earned, and woe for what they have earned."
And they said, "The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days." Say, "Have you taken a covenant from Allah?" Say, "Have you taken a covenant from Allah, or do you speak about Allah what you do not know?"
Nay, those who do evil, and all that is on their faces; these are the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever.
And those who believe and do good works, they are the dwellers of Paradise; they shall abide therein forever.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (saying): "Worship none but Allah, and be dutiful to parents, and to the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the orphans, and the needy, and the prayer, and pay the poor-rate, and pay the poor-rate, and give charity, then you have turned away from a few."
“And (remember) when We took your covenant (saying): ‘You shall not shed your blood, nor expel you from your homes.’
Then you were killed from his people, and from his people a group of the people, and some of his people, and some of them, and some of them, and some of them, and some of them, and some of them. And they would not be able to bring you out of the Book, and they would not be able to take you in the Book, and they will be returned to you on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Those are the ones who bought the life of the Hereafter for the Hereafter, so their punishment will be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book and followed after him apostles after him; and We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear Signs, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit, so that when a messenger came to you, you were arrogant, and you slew others.
And they say, "Our hearts are wrapped in their hearts; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe."
And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming that which is with them, and that which is with them, they seek help from the unbelievers, and when there came to them the truth, they disbelieve therein.
Evil is that which Allah has sent down for those who have been sent down to Allah, that they may disbelieve in Allah's bounty, that Allah may bestow down His Mercy from among His servants whom He wills of His servants; and the unbelievers will have a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what has been sent down to us," and they disbelieve in what they have been sent down, and it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, "Why did you not kill the prophets of Allah?"
Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you took the calf after him, and you were wrongdoers.
And (remember) when We took your covenant and raised above you the Mount (saying): "Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen to them." They said, "We hear and we obey," and their hearts took their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, "This is what you used to believe, if you are believers."
Say: "If the abode of the Hereafter is with Allah alone, there is no need for you except for the people, if you are truthful."
And they will never wish for that which their hands have sent before them, and Allah knows the unjust.
And thou wilt find them in the company of those who disbelieve, and those who are idolaters, and those who associate others with Allah. Each one of them will be able to give life a thousand years, and they shall not be able to save him from his punishment; and Allah sees what they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (Gabriel) has been sent down to you by Allah (i.e. the Qur'an) by Allah's Permission, confirming what was before it, and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers."
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael, then Allah is the enemy of the disbelievers.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) clear Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and they disbelieve not in the Oneness of Allah.
Or, when they had made a covenant, a party of them did not believe, but most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah, confirming what is with them, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they were not aware.
And those who were bent on denying the signs of the devils, after that, the devils, and the devils, did not believe, except the devil, the devil, the devil, the devils, the devils, and the angels, and they were standing down in the land, and they were standing on the side of the earth. And they were not to be able to do anything of the things they had been given. And if they had forgotten it, they would not be able to destroy it. And if they had forgotten it, they would not be able to destroy it. And if they had forgotten it, it was a bad thing.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, they would have been better from Allah, but if they had known.
O you who believe! do not say (O Muhammad SAW): "Take not the Qur'an, and say (to the Prophet), "Listen to the truth, and listen to the unbelievers."
The People of the Book and those who disbelieve have no good among you from your Lord, and that Allah will bestow His Mercy upon you, and Allah chooses for His Mercy whom He pleases, and Allah is the possessor of bounty.
And when We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, then We bring it to be better or a better thing. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?
Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, and that you have no protector or any helper?
Have you asked your Messenger to ask questions of what Moses had before Moses, and he who believes in the way of faith has strayed from the way of error.
Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you away from your faith after they had believed after their belief has become clear to them from the truth. But pardon and overlook, and forgive and overlook; and forgive and overlook; God has power over all things.
And perform the prayer and pay the poor-rate and give charity for whatever good you have sent before you; and whatever good you send before you, you will find it with Allah.
And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." They are their own desires. Say: "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Nay, but whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is a doer of good, he will receive his reward from his Lord, and there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians have nothing to stand on," and the Christians say, "The Jews have nothing to stand on," although they recite the Book, although they recite the Book. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they differ.
And who is more unjust than one who prevents the mosques of Allah in His name, seeking His name, and strives for their ruin, and strives for them in their homes? For them is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter is a great punishment.
And to Allah belong the East and the West, so whither you turn, there is no refuge from Allah; surely Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
They say, "Allah has taken a son." Glory be to Him. Glory be to Him, all that is in the heavens and the earth, all praise belongs to Him.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees a thing, He says to it, "Be!" and it is.
And those who do not know say, "Why does Allah not speak to us, or not to bring us a sign?" And those who have passed before them are like those who have passed before them. Those who have passed before them are like a sign.
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the dwellers of the Fire.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor will the Christians follow you until you follow their religion. Say, "The guidance of Allah is the only guidance." And if you follow their desires, they will have no protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book recite it as it is recited to them. They believe in it, and those who do not believe therein are the losers.
O Children of Israel! call to mind My favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you above the nations.
“Beware of the Day when no soul shall be changed to any soul, nor shall any intercession be accepted from it, nor any ransom shall be accepted from it, nor shall they be helped.”
And when Abraham tried his Lord with certain words, and fulfilled it, He said, "I am going to make you a leader." He said, “I am going to make you a son.” He said, “The wrongdoers will not be successful.”
And (remember) when We made the House a place of security and a place of security for the people, and the place of Ibrahim (Abraham) standing in place of Ibrahim (Abraham), and We enjoined Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ya'qoob (Ishmael) and Ya'qoob (Ishmael), that they may purify My House, and those who prostrate (to Him).
And when Ibrahim said, "My Lord, make this a city of security, and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said, “I believe in him, and I give him a taste of the punishment of the Fire.”
And when Ibrahim and Ishmael built the foundations of the House, they said: Our Lord! accept this from us; Thou art the Hearer, the Knower.
Our Lord, make us submissive to You, and make us a nation of among our descendants, and make us a nation of worship, and grant us our rites, and forgive us. You are the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
“Our Lord, send among them a Messenger from among themselves who will recite to them Your verses, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and purify them.
And who did not follow the religion of Abraham except that which he used to destroy, and We made him in this world in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Surrender," he said, "I submit to the Lord of the worlds."
And Abraham instructed his sons to take his sons and Jacob, saying, "O my sons, Allah has chosen for you, so do not die except as Muslims."
Or did you bear witness when death came to death, when he said to his sons, “What will you worship after me?” They said, “We will worship your God, your God, Abraham and Isaac, the God of your forefathers, Abraham and Isaac.”
A nation has passed away from what they have earned, and for you is what they earned, and you will not be questioned about what you used to do.
And they say: "Become Jews or Christians," they say, "You follow the religion of Abraham." Say, "We follow the religion of Abraham, the upright."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "We believe in Allah and that which was sent down to us, and that which was revealed to him, and that which was revealed to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the children of Israel, and the children of Israel, and the prophets, and the apostles, and the apostles, and the apostles, and those who were given the apostles, We make no distinction between any of them."
But if they believe as you believe, they are rightly guided; but if they turn back, they are in schism; but if they turn back, then they are in schism; and Allah is the Hearer, the Knower.
Who is better in Allah's religion, and who is better than Allah? And we worship Him.
Say: "Do you dispute with us about Allah, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord, and our deeds are for our deeds and your deeds are for Him, and we are sincere to Him?"
Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Jews were Jews or Christians? Say: "God knows better, or who is better in the sight of Allah?" And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
This is a nation who have passed away, so that they have earned what they have earned, and for you is what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
The people of the people will say to the foolish ones, "Has they guided them?" Say, "The East and the West belong to Allah." Say, "To the east and the west, He guides whomever He wills."
And thus We have made you a middle nation, so that you might be witnesses over the people, and the Messenger to be a witness over you, and the Messenger that you have not followed before the Messenger. And those who have gone before you are those who turn away from Allah and the Messenger. And those who are guided by Allah's guidance are only to be able to believe. Allah is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.
We see the turning of the heavens to you. We will certainly turn you back to the qiblah of a qiblah, so turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. Then you turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are, they will know that it is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not aware of what they do.
And if all the people of the Book had come to you, they would not follow your qiblah, nor would you follow their qiblah, nor are you to follow their qiblah, nor are they who follow the qiblah of the qiblah of the followers of the Book; and if they follow their desires, then you are among the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We gave the Book (i.e. the Qur'an), they recognize it as well as they recognize their sons, and most of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of the doubters.
And for every one has a direction to whom he turns back, then hasten to the good; wherever you are, Allah will bring you together; surely Allah has power over all things.
And when you turn forth from it, turn your face to the Sacred Mosque, and it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn forth, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your face to the Sacred Mosque; and if you turn your backs to them, they will not have any argument against you except those of them who are unjust, so fear them, and do not fear them.
Similarly, We have sent among you a Messenger from among you, rehearsing to you Our Verses, and sanctifying you, and teaching you the Book and the wisdom, and teaches you that which you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek help with patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the patient.
“And say not of those who are killed in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive, but you do not perceive.”
And indeed, We will test you with full of fear and loss, and with wealth and of lives, and of fruits, and of fruits; and give glad tidings to the patient.
Who, when disaster strikes them, say, "Indeed we belong to Allah, and to Him we shall return."
They are those on whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.
And the Safa and the Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. It is not for him who performs the House of Allah, or the one who performs the pilgrimage. And whoever does good, then Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.
Those who have turned away from the truth and the guidance after that which We have sent down to them in the Book, and that which they have seen, Allah will curse them and curse them with their curse.
Except those who repent and do good, and make clear to them, for I am the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, they are the angels of Allah and the angels and all mankind.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
Your God is One God, there is no god but He, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, and the ships in the sea, and the ships in the sea, and that which He sends down from the sky, and that which He sends down from the sky, and that which He sends down from the sky, and that which He sends down from the sky, and that which is in the heavens and the earth, and that there is signs in the heavens, and in the earth there are signs for men who understand.
And among men are those who attribute equals to Allah as they attribute to Allah, as they love Allah, and those who believe in Allah, and those who do wrong, and those who do wrong, they see that they see the punishment, and Allah is severe in punishment.
Those who followed those who followed those who followed them will see the torment, and they will be cut off from them.
And they will say, "If we were to return to the life of this world, we would certainly have turned away from them." Thus Allah will show them their deeds for their deeds, and they will not be able to escape from the fire.
O men, eat of what is in the earth and eat from the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Satan. He is your enemy.
He only enjoins you only of evil and indecency, and that you do not know what you know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has sent down," they say, "We will follow what we found our fathers following." Their fathers did not know what their fathers did not know.
The parable of those who disbelieve is like the parable of a man who shouts to nothing but a goat, a herd, a preacher, and a preacher, and they are blind.
O you who believe! eat of the good things which We have provided for you, and give thanks to Allah, if it is He that worship Him.
He has made you die, and blood, and blood, and blood, and the blood of the swine, and that which has been invoked from other than Allah. But whoever is forced by necessity, there is no sin on him, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
“Those who conceal the Book of Allah, and a small price for a small price, they shall eat from their bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful punishment.”
They are the ones who have purchased the way of error for guidance and forgiveness for forgiveness.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth, and those who differ in the Book are in a great opposition.
You will not call your backs on the East and the West, the good, the good, the good, one who believes in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the prophets, and the orphans and the needy, and the orphans and the needy, and the orphans and the needy, and the orphans and the needy, and the orphans and the needy, and the orphans and the needy, and the orphans and the needy, and those who are patient, and they are the ones who are truthful.
O you who believe, there is a lesson for you from the religion of your religion. And he who has passed away from the woman, he has forbidden her wife, and the woman who is pregnant from his brother, and he who turns away from his brother, he will give him the best. This is a mercy from your Lord, and he is a mercy from your Lord; and whoever transgresses after that, he is a painful punishment.
And in the life of you there is life in your life, so that you may guard (against evil).
And when death approaches you, when death approaches among you, he will give a bequest to parents, and to the near of kin in the near of kin. This is the duty of the pious.
But if they after a after after after having after after after having been given it, the sin of sin will only fall only upon them; for God is All-hearing, All-knowing.
But if any one who fears partiality or transgression, then the one who is forced to make a distinction between the parties, then there is no sin on him, for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard (against evil).
A number of days for a number of days; then whoever among you is sick or is sick, there is no need for them on the day of the day; and those who give the feeding of the feeding of the poor, the feeding of the feeding of the needy; and whoever does good, it is better for him; and if you know, you will be better for it.
It is in the Qur’an that the Qur’an is revealed in the Qur’an that the Qur’an is in the Qur’an that the Qur’an is a guide for you.
And when My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close to thee; I respond to the prayer of the supplicant when he calls upon Me, so let them respond to Me, and believe in Me, that they may be guided.
It has been lawful for you in the night of your wives. They are as a garment for you, and you are a garment for them, and you are a garment for them. Allah knows that you were guilty of your enemies, and He forgave you from you, so that He may forgive you of your sins, and eat from you the light of the light. So do not go near to them. Allah makes clear His revelations to mankind, so that they may be mindful of the day of the light. Thus do Allah make clear His revelations to men that they may guard.
“And do not devour your property in the property of your property, and do not make it lawful for you to consume the property of the people in the property of the people, and you will know what you have done.”

O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not sent down after him? Will you not then understand?
You are the ones who dispute about that which you have knowledge of. Do you dispute about that which you have no knowledge? God knows and you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian, but he was a Christian, he was a Muslim, and he was not of the idolaters.
The people of Abraham are those who follow him, the Messenger, the Messenger, and the believers, and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
A group of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they do not lead themselves astray, but they do not understand.
O People of the Book, why do you not believe in Allah's revelations, while you bear witness?
O People of the Book! Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?
And among the People of the Book there is a party who say, "Believe in what has been sent down to those who believe in what has been revealed to the believers, and disbelieve in it, so that they may turn away."
And do not believe in those who follow your religion except the religion of your religion; say, "The guidance of Allah is the guidance, and they say, ‘You do not believe.’ Say, "The Holy Spirit is in Allah's hand. He bestows it on whom He pleases, or Allah is Ample-giving, and He knows all things."
He bestows His Mercy upon whom He pleases, and Allah is the possessor of bounty.
And among the People of the Book there is a party who give you credit of faith, if you give him permission, and among them is a party of them who will not leave you with him. This is because they say, “We do not sit on you,” because they say, “We have no excuse.”
Nay, but whoever fulfills his pledge and fears Allah, verily, Allah loves those who guard (against evil).
Those who sell the covenant of Allah and their oaths as a small price, they will not be in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement.
And among them are some who distort the Book with their tongues, so that you may think that you have a part of the Book, and it is not from the Book. And they say, "This is from Allah." And they say, "This is from Allah." And they will say, "This is from Allah, and they know about Allah."
It is not for any human being that Allah gave the Book to the Book and the Prophethood and the Prophethood, and then He said to men: "Be my servants apart from Allah."
Nor did He command you to do the angels and the prophets, and the prophets, if you have submitted to Him.
And (remember) when Allah took the covenant from the Prophets (saying): "I have given you the Book and the Hikmah (Torah) and Hikmah (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) to come to you, confirming what is with you, you must believe in him and help him."
But those who turn away after that, they are the transgressors.
Are they seeking a religion other than Allah, and whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, and to Him will they be returned?
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us, and that which was revealed to us, and that which was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob, and the children of Moses, and the prophets, and the prophets, and all of the prophets, and We make no distinction between them."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after they disbelieved and bore witness that the Messenger had come to them with clear arguments, and that Allah would not guide the unjust people?
These are the ones who will be cursed by the curse of Allah, the angels, and the whole angels.
They will abide therein forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
Except for those who repent after that, and make amends. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who disbelieve after their belief and then increase in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted, and they are astray.
Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the earth will not be accepted from them, as if they were a ransom for the earth, and they will have no helpers.
By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend of that which you love; and whatever you spend, Allah knows it well.
All food is lawful for the children of Israel, except for the Children of Israel that which was forbidden to the Children of Israel. Say, "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Then those who invent a lie against Allah will be unjust.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah has spoken the truth, follow the religion of Abraham, the religion of Abraham, the upright, he was not of the polytheists."
Indeed, the first House (of worship) established for mankind was that at Makkah, blessed and a guidance for the worlds.
There are signs in the clear verses of Abraham; and whoever enters it, it is secure for him; and Allah calls the House for the House of the House; and whoever disbelieves, it is for Allah; and whoever disbelieves, then Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O people of the Scripture! Why do you not believe in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, while Allah is Witness over what you do?"
Say, "O People of the Scripture, why do you bar those who believe from the Path of Allah, seeking that which you do not desire? But you are the witnesses, and Allah is not unaware of what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey some of the People of the Book, they will turn you back after your belief.
And how could you disbelieve when the Verses of Allah are recited to you, and His Messenger is in you? And whoever takes fast to Allah, He will guide him on the straight path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast to the rope of Allah, and do not be divided; and remember the favour of Allah on you when you were enemies, and He made your hearts into your hearts, and He made your hearts into your hearts, and you were not from the brink of the Fire; and He saved you from the brink of the Fire. Thus Allah makes His signs clear to you, so that you may be guided.
And there is a group among you who invite him to good, enjoin good, and enjoin the evil and forbid evil, and these are the successful.
And be not like those who are divided and disagreed after having come to them after receiving Clear Signs, and there is a great punishment for them.
On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be blackened, then those whose faces will be blackened will be asked, "Did you disbelieve after your faith? Then taste the punishment for your disbelief."
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and they shall abide therein forever.
These are the signs of Allah, which We recite to you with truth, and Allah does not desire the wrong-doers.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Allah all matters are returned.
You are the best of the nations. You were created to create the best of the people, and you enjoin the good and forbid the bad. And if the People of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them; and most of them are believers.
They will not harm you, but they will harm you, and if they fight you, they will certainly turn you back, and they will not be helped.
They have incurred a curse from Allah and the people, except for a group of men, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they have been given a curse from Allah. That is because they disobeyed the signs of Allah and disobeyed the Prophets. That is because they disobeyed and transgressed.
It is they who are not like the People of the Book; there is a community among the People of the Book, reciting the verses of Allah, and prostrate in prayer.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and they hasten in good works, and they are among the righteous.
And whatever good they do, they shall not be rejected, and Allah knows well those who guard (against evil).
Indeed, those who disbelieve, neither their properties nor their children will avail them from Allah. They are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.
The likeness of this world is like the parable of the life of this world, as the wind of the wind is like the wind of the wind, and it destroys it and destroys it, and Allah does not wrong them.
O you who believe! do not take your trust in those who do not believe, except for those who do not believe in you. They will not be able to harm you for they have chosen you. Their hatred is manifest from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater.
You will love them as well as you do not love you, and when you believe in the Book of God, they say, “We believe,” and when they meet you, they bite their fingers at you. Say, “Die in your rage.” Allah knows what is in the hearts.
If good befalls you, it grieves them; but if any misfortune befalls you, they rejoice in it; and if you are patient, they will not hurt you. And if you are patient, they will not harm you. Allah encompasses what they do.
(Remember) when you expelled them from your homes in the morning for the believers, and Allah is Hearer, Knower.
When the two parties met among you, Allah desired to help them, and Allah is their Protector.
And Allah had helped you at Badr when you were weak, so fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, “Is it not enough for you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down?”
If you are patient, and fear Allah, and fear Him, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels.
And Allah did not save you except as a good news and that your hearts may rest with you, and Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
That He might cut off the Unbelievers from the unbelievers, or expose them to infamy, and they turn away from it.
“Not for you (O Muhammad SAW) is the decision (of decision), whether He turns to them, or punishes them, for they are the Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers, etc.).”
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; He forgives whomever He wills, and He punishes whom He pleases, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that you may be successful.
“And fear the Fire because of the Fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers.”
And obey Allah and His Messenger, that you may obtain mercy.
“Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whose width is the width of the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.”
Those who spend in prosperity and adversity, and who restrain anger, and pardon men; and Allah loves the doers of good.
And those who, when they have committed an indecency or wronged themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives sins except Allah?
The reward of their Lord is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever.
Many nations have passed away before you, so travel through the earth and see how was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a sign for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for those who guard (against evil).
“And do not grieve, nor grieve, and you will be superior, if you are believers.”
If a wound has touched you, then a similar wound has touched you, and these are the ones who have turned away from the people; and that Allah may test those who believe and bring witnesses from among you; and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test those who believe and disbelieve in the disbelievers.
Did you think that you will enter Paradise, while Allah has not struggled with those who have struggled against you and those who are patient?
And indeed, you used to die before death before you met, and you did not see it.
Muhammad is not a messenger, but there is a Messenger before him; then if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? And if he dies, he will not harm Allah, and Allah will reward the grateful.
And there is no death for him except by Allah's decree, except for a predetermined term, and whosoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We shall give him thereof; and We shall give thanks for the grateful.
And many of the apostles have fought with many of them, and many of them took the covenant in the Path of Allah; they did not become weak in what they did, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, and Allah loves the patient.
And their saying, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and our transgressions, and make our feet firm and help us against the disbelieving people."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the reward of the Hereafter; and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, then you will be losers.
But Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they associated with Allah for that which He has sent down no authority. Their abode is the Fire, and it is the abode of the unjust.
And indeed Allah promised you the promise of your promise, when you took covenant with them, and you disputed about them, and you disputed about it, and you disputed about it, and you did not differ in the life of your Lord, and you were among you; and He did not forgive you of the desires of the world; and He has pardoned you, and Allah is the possessor of the believers.
And when you turned back, and did not wait for any one of you, and the Messenger will rear you in your rear; then He gave you the taste of sorrow, so that you might not grieve for that which you have escaped, and that which you might not grieve, and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Then He has sent down upon you a light, which has been sent down to you from among you, and a party of you who disbelieved, and some of them who had wronged them, and some of them said, "What is it that Allah has given us?" They said, "What is Allah?" Say, "What is in this matter?" Say, "It is not for us." Say, "This is Allah's command." Say, "It is not for us." Say, "Had we had been given a thing in your hands, they would not be able to bring it away." And Allah knows what is in your hearts, and Allah knows what is in your hearts.
Those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met the two armies, Satan made them slip in some way because they used to slip from evil. But Allah pardoned them; surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve and say to their brothers when they travel in the land or fighting, and they said, "If they had been with us, they would not have died, nor would they have been killed." God gives life and causes death to die; and Allah is Seer of what you do.
And if you are killed or die in the cause of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all that they amass.
And if you die or die, then you will be gathered to God.
So it is from Allah's mercy to you that you deal with them, and you were rough, hard hearted, and they would certainly have dispersed from around you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and ask forgiveness for them; then when you have decided, then put your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, then who can help you after Him?
And there is no compulsion in the Messenger, but he who deceives him will be humbled by the Day of Resurrection, then every person will be repaid with what he has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is someone who follows the pleasure of Allah like someone who has turned away from Allah's wrath, his abode, and his abode is Hell?
They are in varying grades with Allah, and Allah sees what they do.
Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, rehearsing unto them His Signs, and sanctifying them, and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom, although they were in manifest error.
And when the punishment befell you, if you had touched them twice, you said, “What is this?” Say, “This is from your own hands.” Say, "This is from your own accord. God has power over all things."
And what befell you on the day when your armies met, by Allah's leave, and that He might test the believers.
And the hypocrites know that it was said to them, "Come, fight in the way of Allah, or fight." They said, "If we were to fight with you, we would certainly have been with you." They said, "We were with you." They are nearer to their mouths, but they say, "There is no compulsion in their hearts. God knows what they hide."
They are the ones who said to their brothers, and they had remained behind, and if they had believed they would not have been killed. Say, "If you were truthful, then you would have died from death."
And do not think of those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead; they are alive, and they are alive with their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has given them of His bounty, and they rejoice in what they have not joined, and they have no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in Allah and His Bounty, and Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to Allah and His Messenger after a wound after having been wounded, and those who do good, and those who have Taqwa and fear, will have a great reward.
Those to whom the people said: "The people have gathered against you, so fear them; but it only increased their faith, and they said: Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs."
So they returned with grace from Allah and His bounty, and touched them with no harm, and they followed the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.
It is only Satan who frightens his Auliya (supporters and friends) from his Auliya (supporters and helpers), so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And let not those grieve you who rush to Unbelief in Unbelief, but they do not harm Allah at all. Allah desires not to give them any portion in the Hereafter, and they shall have a great punishment.
Those who purchase the price of disbelief will not harm Allah, and they will have a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for them; We grant them respite only that they may increase their sins; and they shall have a humiliating punishment.
Allah will not leave the believers to you in that which you are in you, and Allah gives you the good news of the Unseen, and Allah chooses of His messengers whom He pleases. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and if you believe, you will have a great reward.
And do not let those who are niggardly of what Allah has given them of His bounty think that it is better for them; nay, it is worse for them; it is worse for them, they will be niggardly on their necks on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Allah has heard the saying of those who say: "Allah is poor, and we are rich." We shall say, "We shall write down the Torah and their killing." They will say, "Taste the torment of the Fire."
That is because of what your hands have sent before your own hands, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say, "Allah has promised us to do not believe in a Messenger unless he brings us into the Fire." Say, "Messengers came to you before me, and with what you say." Say, "Messengers have come to you before me, and what you say is true."
But if they belie you, then Messengers were denied before you, who came to them with Clear Signs, and the Book and the Book, and the Book of Enlightenment.
Every soul shall taste death, and you will be paid on the Day of Resurrection, and you will be paid to the Garden and the Garden, and whoever has been removed from the Fire, he has indeed attained to himself, and the life of this world is nothing but a delusion.
You will certainly be tested in your wealth and your heart, and you will certainly listen to those who have been given the Book before you and from those who have been given the Book before you. But if you are patient and fear Allah, He is the All-Seer of all things.
And (remember) when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book (i.e. the Qur'an) to make a covenant of the Book (i.e. the Qur'an) to mankind, and you did not hide it, and it was not that they threw it away from their backs, and it was a small price for a small price.
Do not think those who rejoice in what they have done, and love for what they do not do, and they do not think of the punishment of the punishment; they will have a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over all things.
The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for men of understanding.
Those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, and say, "Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly.
Our Lord, You will admit him to the Fire, and do not have any helpers.
Our Lord, we have heard a call calling to faith, so believe in your Lord, and we have believed, our Lord, our Lord, forgive us our sins, and do not cause us to die with the righteous.
Our Lord, and grant us what You have promised us of Your messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, you do not break His promise.
Then their Lord answered them, "I will not make you any one of you, the male, or the female, of some of you; some of you are equal; and they have left their homes, and they have left their homes, and they will be fought, and they will be cut off, and they will be raised in the Gardens of Eden. This is Allah's reward, and Allah is with the best."
Let not the unbelievers deceive you from the unbelievers.
This is a brief enjoyment; then their abode is hell, and an evil destination!
But those who fear their Lord, for them are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide therein forever. The reward of Allah is better for the righteous.
And there are those among the People of the Book who believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you, and what has been sent down to them, and what has been sent down to them, and they do not sell the communications of Allah for a small price; these are they who have their reward with their Lord; surely Allah is swift in taking account.
O you who believe! persevere, and be patient, and be patient, and be careful of God, and fear Allah that you may prosper.
O mankind, fear your Lord who created you from a single soul, and created from it its mate, and from them both created many men and women; and fear Allah, and the wombs, and do not fear the wombs of the wombs; surely Allah is watchful over you.
And give the orphans their wealth, and do not exchange the good things, and strive with their property; and do not eat your property with your property.
And if you fear that you should not marry the orphans, then do not marry one of the women of the women who are married to your wives, and the four of them, and if you fear that you are not one of you, or that you may be one of the judges.
And give the women their dowries as a gift, but if they were pleased with you, they would have given you a part of it.
“And do not let your property do not give you wealth, for which Allah has provided you, and provide them from them, and clothe them with good words.”
And give them the orphans until the age of age age; then if you have reached them with them, give them their wealth, and give them their wealth, and do not eat from them, and do not eat from them; and if any is a treasure, let it be due to you; and when you give them their wealth, you bear witness against them; and Allah is swift in taking account.
And there is a share for those who are near to parents and parents, and the wives of their parents, and the wives of their parents, and the wives, or a little, or if they are a little.
And when the relatives and the orphans and the needy and the needy are present to the needy, and speak to them out of them, and speak to them words of kindness.
And let them fear those who have left behind them after their offspring, and let them be afraid of their fear. Let them fear Allah, and let him speak the truth.
“Those who devour the property of the orphans in their bellies, in their bellies, are only in their bellies, and they will burn in Hell.”
Allah has enjoined to you the sons of your sons, that He may give you two wives, and if they are two wives, they are two wives, and if they are two wives, they are two wives, and if they are one of the two sons, it is only one of them; and if he is a son, he is one of those who possess a little than Allah. And if he is a son, he is a slave of Allah, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
And the wives of your wives have come to you, and if there is a child, if they have a son, then if a child is a child, then if a child is a child, then you have a share of what they have taken, and if you have a child, then if you have a child, and if you have a child, then if you have a child, or if you have a child, it is not for them. And if you have a child or a child, then let them be a slave. And if you have a child, they will not be able to give you a share. And if you have a child or a child, then let them be a slave. And Allah is Knowing, Forbearing.
These are the limits of Allah; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever. That is the great success.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, and transgresses His limits, He will admit him into the Fire to abide therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment.
“And if any of your women who commit adultery, take witness of them from among your women, and if they bear witness to them, confine them to the houses until death overtakes them, or Allah guides them for a way.”
And (as for) the two of you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, punish them; but if they repent, then turn away from them; surely Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
Allah accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance, and then afterwards repent, and then turn back to them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And repentance is not for those who continue to do evil deeds, until death approaches one of them, and he says, "Indeed, I repent," nor of those who die while they die.
O you who have believed, do not let your wives inherit you, [O Muhammad], for the sake of their wives, and do not bring them away from them, except that you should bring them away from what you have given them, and leave them with kindness. And if you do not dislike them, it may be that you may not be able to do anything.
And if you wish to take one another from one another, then take one of them in a place of wealth, and give you a portion of it, and do not bring forth any thing from what you have done.
And indeed, you have made one of you another, and they have taken a covenant from you, and they have taken it from you.
And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what is past; indeed, it is shameful, odious, and abominable.
Your wives have taken your wives as well as your wives, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the other, and the other, and my sons, and my sons, and my sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and your sons, and those who have passed away before you. And if you do not come to them, then do not have any blame over you.
And the women of your wives are not equal to your own hands. God has ordained you for your wives, and you have no other than them. And if you strive for their property, they will not be able to marry you from the property of your property. And if you have given them their wealth, then you have given them the gift of marriage. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And (as for) those who accuse you of believing women and believing women, the women of the believing women are no more than those of you who are believers, and those who are near to you, and Allah knows best your faith; then they are equal to you, and they do not marry their own husbands. And they are equal to their own husbands; and if you die, then do not marry them. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
God wants to make you clear to you, and He guides you to the ways of those who have gone before you; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And Allah desires to show you His Mercy, and those who follow their lusts desire that you deviate from the right path.
Allah wants to lighten your burden for you, and man was created weak.
O you who have believed, do not consume your property in the property of one another, but do not kill yourselves. And do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is Most Merciful to you.
And whoever commits aggression and injustice, We shall roast him in the Fire, and that is easy for Allah.
If you are guilty of the sins of the sins of sins, you shall remit from them your sins, and We will admit you into the Gardens of Bliss.
Do not covet what Allah has given you of others above others; men are given a portion of what they have earned, and they have a share according to what they have earned; and seek His bounty from His bounty; surely Allah knows all things.
And to those who have left behind the parents of parents and kinsmen, and those with whom you have made a treaty, give them their share. God is witness over all things.
These are the women who have preferred some of others to excel others from Allah. And they spend their wealth in their wealth, and they spend their wealth for the good of the women; and those who do not know that the fear of Allah is upon them, and those who do not turn away from you. And if they obey you, they do not seek you to go astray. Allah is High, mighty.
And if you fear a breach between them twain, appoint him from his family, and from his family, and from his family, and if they wish, Allah will cause their reconciliation; surely Allah is Knowing, Knowing.
And worship Allah, and do not associate anything with Him, and to be dutiful to parents, orphans, the orphans, the orphans, the needy, the neighbor, the neighbour, the neighbor, the traveller, the traveller, and the wayfarer. Indeed, Allah does not love the arrogant.
Those who are niggardly, and enjoin others, and enjoin what Allah has given them of His bounty, and We have prepared for the unbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who spend their wealth in the sight of men, and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and whoever takes his companion, is an evil companion.
And if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spend out of what Allah has given them, and Allah knows what they have been doing.
Allah does not wrong the weight of an atom's weight, and if any is good, He multiplies it, and He has a great reward.
How shall it be when We bring forth from every nation a witness, and We bring you to a witness against them?
On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth will be levelled with them, and they will not be able to hide from Allah a single word.
O you who believe! do not come near to prayer until you come to prayer until you know what you say, and that you may go forth from the Sacred Mosque, and you are expelled from the house, and if you are sick or you are sick, you shall not be able to eat from them, or your hands, or your hands, and your hands, and your hands, and your hands; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, purchasing error in error, and wish to lead you astray from the Path?
And Allah knows best your enemies, and Allah is Sufficient as a protector, and Allah is sufficient as a supporter.
And the Jews, they have turned away from their homes, and they turn to Him, and enjoin Him, and enjoin His words, and they will say, “Yes,” and they say, “It is better for them,” and they say, “It is better for them.”
O People of the Book! We believe in what We have sent down to you, confirming that which is with you, before We turn away from them, and We turn them away from them, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath of the Sabbath; and Allah is the command of the Judges.
“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, and He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills.”
Have you not seen those who say, "He who chooses to be praised?" But God will be pleased with whomever He wills, and they will not be wronged.
See how they invent lies against Allah, and that is a manifest sin.
Hast thou not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, that they believe in Allah and the devils, and those who disbelieve say to those who disbelieve, "These are better than the believers?"
Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed, and whomever Allah sends astray, you will never find any helper for him.
Is there any one among them among them, then, that they will not be able to be able to do the same?
Or do they envy men because of Allah's bounty which He has given them? But We have given Abraham the Book and the wisdom, and We gave them a great kingdom.
And of them are some who believe in the Book, and some of them turn away from it, and there is a flaming fire.
As for those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), We shall roast them in the Fire, but when their skins are roasted into their skins, We shall change their skins, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
As for those who believe and do good works, We shall admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever; they shall have therein spouses, spouses, and We shall admit them to gardens of rivers.
Allah commands you to give your trusts to their owners, and when you judge between men with justice, then judge with justice; surely Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.
O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those among you who are beyond the matter of the matter, and if you dispute about any dispute, you will refer to Allah and the Messenger and the Messenger. And if you believe in Allah and the Last Day, you will be better.
Have you not seen those who believe that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what has been sent down before you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to be ordered to judge against the devil, and Satan intends to lead them astray.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites turning away from you.
How then, when evil befalls them, because of what their hands have wrought before them, they come to you swearing by Allah, and they will come to you, “We did not desire good and conciliation.”
Those are the ones who know what Allah knows, so turn away from them, and admonish them, and speak to them their words.
“We did not send any messenger but that he should be obeyed by Allah's permission, and when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you, and the Messenger had come to you, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would certainly have found Allah, the Most Merciful, the Merciful.”
“But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they make you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) judge with them in the matter of their disputes, and then find not in their hearts any discomfort from what you have decided, and submit with full submission.”
And if We had said to them: "Slay yourselves, or leave your homes," they would not have done it, but some of them would have done it, and they would have done what they were exhorted to do.
And We have certainly given them a great reward from Us.
And We guided them on the Straight Path.
And those who obey Allah and His Messenger, they are with those whom Allah has favored, the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, and those who are righteous.
This is from Allah's grace, and Allah is Knower of all things.
O you who have believed, take your precautions, and go forth into companies, or go forth in companies.
And among you is he who lingers behind, and if a disaster befalls you, he would say, "Allah has favored me with that I was not with them."
And if Allah had mercy on you, he would say, as if he had not affection between you, and that he would not have affection between you, and that I had been with them with a great success.
So let them who sell the life of the life of the life of this world should be sold for the life of Allah, and whoever fights in the cause of Allah, or is killed, then We will give him a great reward.
And what is the matter with you that you fight not in the cause of Allah, and for the weak among men, women, and children who say, "Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper?"
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and those who disbelieve are in the way of the devil, then they fight for the devil, and the Shaitan is not an evil tyrant.
Have you not seen those who were told to turn away from their hands, and perform the prayer, and give the poor-due, and give the alms to them, when a party of them were afraid of them, fearing the fear of Allah, and fear him? Say, "Our Lord! You have made us a prison." Say, "Our Lord is the best of those who fear Allah." Say: "The life of this world is better and a date-stone."
When you are dead, you will be raised to death, and if you are in towers, they will say, "This is from Allah." And if any good befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah." Say, "This is from Allah." Say, "This is from Allah."
Whatever good is from you, it is from Allah, and whatever befalls you, it is from it; and We have sent you as a Messenger to men; and Allah suffices as a witness.
“He who obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah; and whoever turns away, then We have not sent you as a watcher over them.”
And they say, "And they say, ‘When you have gone away from you,’ and some of them have gone away from you, some of them takes part of the night; and Allah is the One who takes the night, so turn away from Him; and Allah is sufficient as a protector.
Do they not reflect on the Qur’an? Had there been from Allah, they would certainly have found many contradiction in it.
And when they know the news of security or fear, they are recited to it, and if they had referred it to the Messenger and those among them who were given the Messenger, they would certainly have known it, and it was not for the grace of Allah upon you, and that it were not for the grace of Allah and His Mercy.
So fight in the way of Allah, for you are not responsible for your duty, and the believers will be averse to the believers; then Allah will restrain the unbelievers, and Allah will chastise the unbelievers.
Whoever intercedes with a good deed will have a share of it, and whoever intercedes with an evil deed will have a share of it; and Allah is over all things competent.
“And when you are greeted with peace, greet him with a better greeting than it is better, and Allah is swift in account.”

Except for those who have come to you with a nation who have come to you, and a group who have come to you, or to come to you, to fight against you, or to destroy their people, and if Allah had willed, they would certainly have overcome you, and they would not have taken you away from you. And if they turn away from you, then Allah will not guide you for you.
They will find you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) from you, if they wish to be secure from you, and they wish to be secure from their people, and when they are invited to a place of security, they will be separated from it, and they will not be able to take away from you their hands and kill them. And they will kill them and kill them wherever you find them. And We have given you a clear authority.
And there is no blame on the believers except for those who believe, and whoever believes in Him, He has chosen for His believing servants, and those who have believed and are forgiven from their Lord. And those who are from your enemies are forgiven, and if there is a party of you who is a party of your people, he is a slave, and a slave. And if there is a party of you who turns away from Allah, he is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
“And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell to abide therein, and the Wrath and the Curse of Allah is upon him, and He has prepared for him a great punishment.”
O you who believe! When you travel in the way of Allah, investigate, and do not say to one another, “You are not believers.” And the worldly goods of the life of this world will say, “You are not believers.” Indeed, Allah has given you the bounty, and Allah has given you favor. And Allah is Aware of what you do.
They are not equal to those who believe, and those who are in the way of Allah, and strive with their wealth and their persons with the cause of Allah with their wealth and their persons. And those who strive with their wealth and their persons are better than Allah. And Allah has promised for them the wage of the patient.
Forgiveness from Him, forgiveness, mercy, and mercy. God is Forgiving, Merciful.
Indeed, those who have wronged themselves will say to the angels, "What are you doing?" They will say, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say, "We were oppressed in the land." They will say, "God’s land is the earth." Their abode is hell, and it is an evil destination.
And the men and women, and women, and women, are not able to be able to find a way, nor are they guided.
God will forgive them, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And whoever emigrates in the cause of Allah will find a refuge in the earth, and in the earth there will be plenty of refuge and abundance, and whoever turns back from Allah and His Messenger, then his reward is with Allah; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And when you travel in the land, there is no blame on you if you shorten the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve may attack you; surely the unbelievers are open to you.
And when they call them, they call their prayers, and they are a group of them, and they will find them with them, and they will find them with them. When they are standing before them, they shall go back to you, and they shall go back to them, and they shall be cut off from the middle of the two parties; and if they fall down, they shall be called unto you, and you shall not be able to take it away from your Lord; surely Allah has prepared for the unbelievers a humiliating punishment.
When you have completed your prayer, remember Allah and sitting on your sides, and sitting on your sides, and when you are secure, then perform prayer, and the prayer is for the faithful.
And do not be weak in the pursuit of the enemy. If you are suffering, they are suffering for you; and you hope for Allah, and you hope for hope, and Allah is Knowing, Wise.

Do not be deceived, God does not love those who are treacherous.
They turn away from men from men, and they do not hide from Allah, but they do not hide the night by night; it is He who is with them, and Allah encompasses what they do.
Indeed you are a people who argue about the life of this world, and who will argue with Allah on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be their guardian?
And whoever does evil or wrongs his own soul, then seeks forgiveness of Allah, will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whoever commits a sin, then Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
“And whoever commits a sin or a sin, then he is innocent of it, and he who is innocent of it, he has a calumny and a manifest sin.”
And had it not been for the Grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, and of a party of them to mislead you, and they did not mislead you except with their own souls, and they do not mislead you except they do not hurt you, and Allah has revealed to you the Book and what you do not know. And Allah is the Owner of bounty abounding.
There is no good in their ignorance in secret, except for the good, or the good, or the righteous, or the people, and whoever does good, and whoever does good, he will give him a great reward.
And whoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to him, and follows the way of the believers, he will lead him from the path of the path he has chosen, and We shall roast him in Hell; an evil destination!
“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, and He forgives what is less than that for whom He pleases.”

They ask you concerning the wives of your wives. Say, "Allah has enjoined to you, and to recite to you the Book which you have been given, and that which you have given to the Book, they do not do what they have done of what they do not do, and you do not wish to be able to do good."

And you will not be able to be able to be able to be able to do so, and you will not be able to do so, but you will not be able to do so, but if you do so, then you will be able to do so, and if you do so, then Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

They are the ones who listen to falsehood, and they are averse to you. But if they come to you, they judge between them, or turn away from them; and if they turn away from them, they will not hurt you. And if you judge between them with justice, then surely Allah loves those who do good.
And how can they follow you concerning their religion, and that which is with them is in the Book of Allah, and that they turn back after it, and they are not believers?
We sent down the Torah in the Torah, guidance and light; and the prophets were sent to the prophets, and the prophets, and the Jews, and the Jews, and the witnesses, and they were witnesses of the Book of God; and they were not afraid of that which Allah revealed. And those who do not judge by what Allah sent down, they are unbelievers.
And We ordained for them in the past, a nose for a nose, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, an ear for an ear, and a tooth, and a tooth, and a tooth, and a tooth, and an expiation for the wounds; and whoever does not judge by what Allah has sent down, they are wrongdoers.
And in their footsteps We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming that which was before him of the Taurat (Torah), and We sent him in the Injeel (Gospel) of the Injeel (Gospel), and that which was revealed in the Taurat (Torah), and the light (of the Taurat), and the Taurat (Torah), confirming that which was before it of the Taurat (Torah), and the guidance (of Allah).
And let the people of the Book judge according to what Allah has revealed, and those who do not judge according to what Allah has revealed.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) the Book (the Qur'an) with the truth (i.e. the Book) with the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) of the Book) which Allah has revealed to them, and that which Allah has revealed to them, and what is revealed to you, and that which has come to you from the truth (i.e. that which has come to you), do not follow their desires, and do not follow their desires. And if Allah willed, He could have made you one of you, and that you may not follow their desires. And if Allah had willed, He would have made you all of you, and He will inform you of what you differed.
And that you should judge between them by what Allah has sent down, and follow their desires, and do not follow their desires, and fear them from what Allah has revealed to you. But if they turn back, then know that Allah will punish them for their sins; and most of mankind are transgressors.
Or do they seek the desires of the people of ignorance? And who is better in speech than Allah?
O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as lords; they are one of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease hastening to one another, saying, "We fear lest a misfortune befall us." Then God will send them a victory from Allah, or He will send them back from their hearts.
And those who believe say, "Are these the ones who swore by Allah by Allah that they are with you?
O you who have believed, whoever from among you turns back from his religion, Allah will bring a people like a people who will love Him, and they will love Him, the believers, the unbelievers, they strive hard in the way of Allah. That is Allah's grace, He bestows upon whomever He pleases, and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
Your guardian is only Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, and the believers, those who establish prayer and give zakah.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and the believers and those who believe, they will be the party of Allah.
O you who believe! Make not those who take your religion as a mockery of those who have been given the Book before you and those who were before you, and the unbelievers, and those who disbelieve, and fear Allah, if you are believers.
And when you call your prayer to prayer, they take it as mockery and sport; this is because they are a people who do not understand.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do you disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah and what was sent down to us and what was sent down before us, and that most of you are defiantly disobedient?"
Say, "Shall I inform you of something worse than Allah?" Those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, those of whom He transformed into monkeys and pigs, those who worshipped Him and worshipped Him, they are worse, and far astray from the Path.
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe"; but they have disbelieved in their disbelief, and they go forth with it, and Allah knows best what they hide.
And you see many of them in sin and transgression, and in the devouring of the forbidden, and the devouring of the unlawful, and that which they do.
Why do not the rabbis and the rabbis deceive them, and their wives, and their wives? Evil is what they do.
The Jews say: "Allah's plan is in the hand of Allah." Their hands are with those who say: "They have been cursed by Allah." But they are in the hands of their hands, and it is in the hands of your Lord, and it is not that your Lord has been sent down to you, and that they may die in the land, and that they may die in the land, and that they may make mischief in the land; and Allah does not love the corrupt.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would certainly have remitted their sins and admitted them into gardens of Bliss.
And if they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would certainly have taken away from above their feet and from beneath their feet. There is a party of them who are a community, and most of them do evil.
O Prophet, deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord. And if you do not do it not, you have not conveyed His message, and Allah will protect you from the people. Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book (Jews and Christians), you shall not stand on you until you follow the Torah and the Gospel, and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, many of them will increase in their inordinacy and disbelief.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We sent messengers to them. Whenever there came to them an apostle with their own souls, they did not believe, and some of them killed.
And they thought that there is no affliction, but they became blind, and they became blind and deaf; then Allah turned back from them, yet many of them became blind and deaf.
Those who disbelieve say, "The Messiah is Allah, the son of Mary." The Messiah said, “O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” That is what Allah has forbidden for those who associate with Allah, and his abode is the Fire, and his abode is the Fire.
Those who say, "Allah is the third of the three." There is no god except Allah. There is no god but He. They do not desist from what they say.
Why do they not turn back to Allah, and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. Messengers have passed away before him. And his mother came to him with truth, and his mother ate food. See how We explain Our signs, and how they turn away.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which can neither profit you nor benefit you? Allah is the Hearer, the Knower."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), do not exceed the limits of the truth in your religion, do not follow the desires of the people who went astray before, and do not follow the desires of the people who have gone astray, and strayed from the right path."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, the son of Mary, because they disobeyed and disobeyed.
They did not forbid one another from what they used to do; evil is what they used to do.
You see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which their souls have sent before them, because Allah is displeased with them, and they shall abide in the punishment of Allah.
And if they had believed in Allah and His Messenger and that which was revealed unto him, they would not have taken them as Auliya (protectors and protectors). But most of them are transgressors.
You will find the most hostile of those who believe and those who disbelieve, in the sight of those who disbelieve and those who disbelieve. Those who say, "We are Christians." That is because they are those who say, "We are Christians," and they are not proud.
And when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the truth, they will say, "Our Lord, we believe, so write us down among the witnesses."
And what is the matter with us that we should not believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, and that our Lord will admit us with the righteous people?
So Allah rewarded them with that which they said, with gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. That is the reward of the righteous.
But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are the dwellers of the Fire.
O you who believe! Do not exceed the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress limits; surely Allah does not love the transgressors.
And eat of the good things which Allah has provided for you and good things, and fear Allah in Whom you believe.
Allah has sworn by you that you will not seize you by your oaths, and that you may swear to them that which you have devised, and the hypocrites, and the poor, and those who do not desire the desire of your own hands, or whether they do not give you a pledge, they will be cut off by your own hands; and Allah makes it clear to you that you may be mindful of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may be grateful.
O you who believe! intoxicants and games of wine, and idols and divining arrows, and divining arrows are Satan's handiwork, so that you may be successful.
Satan wants to destroy you with intoxicants and gambling, and to cause you to kill you from the remembrance of Allah and of prayer. Will you not then desist?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and fear Him. But if you turn back, then know that the Messenger is only a clear messenger.
Those who believe and do good, there is no sin for them in what they eat, and they believe, and believe and do good works, and they fear Allah and believe and do good; and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! Allah will test you with your hands, your hands, or your lances, and that Allah may test those who fear Him, and whoever transgresses after that, there is a painful punishment.
O you who believe! Do not be grateful in the state of the land, and you will be killed from among you who killed you. He who kills you from the dead, then He has given you a part of the dead, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor, or the poor; and Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
It is lawful for you to eat the sea, and to eat food for you, and to provide for you a provision for the poor and the needy; and you are in the land, and fear Allah; and fear Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah in the Sacred House, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, and the animals, and the animals, and the month, that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth; and Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is Severe in punishment, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger is only the only Messenger, and Allah knows what you conceal and what you conceal.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The good and the good are not the like of the good, and the evil of the bad, even though the abundance of the bad may attract you; so fear Allah, so that you may prosper."
O you who believe! Do not ask about any of those who have come to you about that which is manifest to you. If you ask about the Qur’an, then you will be given it to you, and Allah will forgive you. And Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.
A people before you asked questions about you, then they disbelieved in it.
Allah has not ordained for a prophet, nor a prophet, nor a prophet, nor a <unk>, and the cattle, and those who disbelieve fabricate a lie; but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we found our fathers following.” Even though their fathers were unaware, they did not know.
O you who have believed, do not follow your own souls. If you are guided, you will not hurt you. God will return to you all of your own deeds. He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who believe! When death approaches you, then one of you are two parties, so that they may make some of you riding in the way of you, or you are other than one another, except you are in the land; then when you are witnesses, then you are in the land, and if you bear witness, then take a witness from Allah, and Allah bears witness to the witnesses.
But if they know that both of them are guilty of the sin of their Lord, the two of them will stand before them, and they will swear by Allah: "Our testimony is truer than the testimony of our two brothers, and we do not exceed the limits, and we have not transgressed."
It is likelier that it may be that they may be truthful by the truth, or that they may fear their oaths, or fear Allah, and fear Allah. And Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
On the Day when Allah will gather all the messengers together, he will say, “What has you received?” They will say, “We have no knowledge.” They will say, “We are the best of all.”
And when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O my mother, I have given you a blessing and a blessing from your mother, and I have given you the Holy Spirit, and the people who have gone down to you, and those who have gone down to you.”
And when I inspired the disciples, [saying], “Believe in Me and My Messenger, they said, ‘We believe.
When the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, will your Lord send down to us a table from heaven?" He said, "Fear Allah, if you are believers."
They said, "We wish to eat from it, and our hearts may be reassured, and we know that you are telling us the truth, and that we are witnesses."
Isa (Jesus) said: “O Allah, our Lord, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven, so that it may be for us the first of us and the last of us and the last of us and the last of us.”
Allah said: “I will send it down upon you, so whoever among you disbelieves after you, I will punish him with a severe torment.”
And when Allah said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to men, ‘Take me and my mother as God?’ He will say, ‘You are not worthy of this.’ He will say, “You will know what is true, and what is in your heart is that I know what is in my heart. You know what is in your hearts. You know what is in your hearts. You know the truth.”
Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say: worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord, and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness over all things.
If You punish them, they are Your servants; and if You forgive them, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”
Allah will say: This is a Day on which the truthful will profit their truthfulness; theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; they shall abide therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and He has power over all things.
All praise is due to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the light and the light and the light, and the disbelievers are equal to their Lord.
It is He Who created you from clay, then decreed for you a term and a term, and then you doubt.
And He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows your secrets and your deeds, and He knows what you earn.
And there came not to them a sign from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
And indeed, they denied the truth when it came to them, but they will come to them in the news of that which they used to mock.
Have they not seen how many a generation We destroyed before them, and We established the earth on earth, which We did not have given you, and We caused them to grow on the sky, and rivers flow beneath them, and We caused them to grow in their sins, and We made them a new creation.
And had We sent down to you a Book from paper, so that they could touch it with their hands, those who disbelieve would have said, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
They say, "Why has not been sent down to him from the angels?" Had We sent down an angel, it would have been decided for it, and they would not be able to respite them.
And if We had sent him an angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would have made it appear with them as they are confused.
And indeed, Messengers were mocked before you, but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to mock.
Say: Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected the truth.
Ask them, "Who is in the heavens and the earth?" Say, "He is Allah, the One, the All-Merciful." And He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection concerning the Day of Resurrection. He will gather you with the Day of Resurrection, and they will not believe.
And to Him belongs whatsoever is in the night and the day, and He is the Hearer, the Knower.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall I take for Him any protector other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and He feeds and gives no sustenance? Say: 'I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit to Allah, and be not of the polytheists.'
Say (O Muhammad): "Verily, if I disobey my Lord, I fear the torment of a Mighty Day."
On that day, whoever is spared from punishment from Allah, Allah has mercy on him, and that is the manifest triumph.
If Allah touches you with affliction, none can remove it except Him; and if He touches you with good, He has power over all things.
He is omnipotent over His servants, and He is the Wise, the Wise.
Say, "What is the matter between you?" Say, "This is Allah's witness, and that Allah bears witness between you and you, and I have revealed to you this Qur'an, and that which is revealed to you, and that you may warn those who are given the truth." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah." Say: "There is no god but Allah."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own sons; those who have lost their own souls will not believe.
Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or denies His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), without any doubt?
On the Day when We gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, "Where are your associates?"
Then they shall have no excuse except that they say, "By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters."
Look at what they used to fabricate, and what they used to invent is from them.
And among them are those who listen to thee, and We have veils veils upon their hearts, lest they understand their ears, and deafness in their ears; and if they see every sign, they do not believe in it; when they come to thee with thee, those who disbelieve say: This is naught but fables of the ancients.
And they bar others from it, and they turn away from it, and they do not destroy themselves, and they do not know.
And if you could see when they will be exposed to the Fire, and they will say, "Would that we would be brought back, and we would not deny the signs of our Lord, and we would be of the believers."
Nay, but they had seen that which they hide before, and if they were returned to it, they would certainly have turned away from what they were forbidden, and they are indeed liars.
And they say: "There is nothing but our life of this world, and we shall not be raised again."
And when you see them when they are standing before their Lord, He will say, "Is this not real?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord." He will say, "Then taste the punishment of your Lord."
Those who deny Allah's meeting with the meeting with Allah, when the Hour comes upon them suddenly, they will say, "Alas for us!" They will say, "Alas for us," and they will bear their backs on their backs.
And the life of this world is nothing but amusement and diversion; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Will you not then understand?
We know that what they say grieves you, so they do not lie to you, but they deny the signs of God.
Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient, and they were patient, and they were patient until Our help came to them. There is none who can alter the words of Allah, and there is no mention of the messengers.
And if their aversion is hard for you, then if you seek a tunnel on the earth, or a ladder in the sky, or a ladder to the sky, then bring them a sign; and if Allah had willed, He could have brought them all together, so do not be of those who do not know.
Those who hear (the truth) will be called to Allah (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), and those who are bent on denying Allah will be returned to the Day of Resurrection.
They say, "Why has not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "God has sent down a sign, but most of them do not know."
And there is no animal on the earth, nor a bird, nor a bird with its wings, but they are like you as are like you; We have not neglected this Book, then they shall be gathered to their Lord.
And those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), are deaf and dumb in the darkness of the darkness; Allah guides whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases.
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you, or the Hour, or the Hour, will you call upon other than Allah, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but they call upon Him, and if He wills, He will remove you from what you call upon Him, and you forget what you associate with Him.
And certainly We sent Messengers before you before you, and We afflicted them with suffering and adversity, so that they might humble themselves.
So why did they not fall upon them when Our punishment came to them, and their hearts were hardened, and their hearts became hardened, and Satan has made fair deeds for them.
Then, when they forgot that which they forgot, We opened them all of them, and when they were given what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were in despair.
So the people of the evildoers were cut off, and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight and sealed your hearts, that He should bring you back to other than Allah?
Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly or openly, will be destroyed except the unjust people?"
And We send not the messengers but as givers of good news and as warners. But those who believe and mend their deeds, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
And those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will be punished for their crime.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the Unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel, and I do not follow any other thing except that which has been revealed to me. Say: 'Are the blind and the right?'
And warn those who fear their Lord with fear of their Lord, and they have no protector besides Him, and that they may guard with fear.
And do not turn away from those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance, they will not be responsible for their account, nor do they have any account of their affairs, nor are you to be of the wrongdoers.
And thus We have made some of them in some of them, so that they might say, "Are these the ones whom Allah has favored among us?" God does not know the thankful.
And when those who believe in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) come to you, say: "Peace be upon you, your Lord has mercy on Himself." But if any of you does evil in ignorance, then repented and amends, then He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), that they may be guided.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah. Say: 'I will not follow your desires. Say, "I will not follow your desires; I will certainly be of the guided."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I am only a plain proof from my Lord, and you have denied you, that you are not responsible for what you are impatient; it is not for Allah's command, He has revealed the truth, and He is the best of deciders."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Even if you had remained in your homes, that would certainly have been decided between me, and that which you have been decided, and Allah knows best the unjust."
And His is the keys of the unseen in the Unseen, but He knows what is in the land; and He knows what is in the land and the sea; and there is no grain but a leaf, nor a leaf, nor a leaf, nor a leaf, nor any dry thing.
And He it is Who takes your souls by night, and He knows what you have done by day; then He raises you up in the midst that a term may be fulfilled; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you used to do.
And He is the One Who sends His servants over His servants, and He sends over you the guardians of the dead, when death approaches one of you, and they do not perceive.
Then they will be brought back to Allah, the True, the True. He is the Lord of the Throne, and He is swift in reckoning.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Who rescues you from the darkness of the darkness of the darkness of the darkness and the sea, when you call upon Him and secretly and secretly?" Say: "If we were from Allah, we would certainly be of the grateful."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah rescues you from the distress and from every distress, and then you associate Him with Him."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "He has power over you from above you from above you or from above your feet, or to make you one of the factions, and to make you taste the violence of one another. Look see how We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they may understand."
And your people deny it, and it is the truth. Say, "I am not a guardian over you."
Each one of you will be appointed, and you will know.
And when you see those who engage in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), turn away from them, until they engage in some other discourse, and if Satan touches you, then do not sit after the wrongdoers after recollection.
And those who guard (against evil) are not responsible for the remembrance of their Lord, but there is a reminder for them, so that they may guard (against evil).
And those who take their religion as a sport and sport, and give them the life of this world's life, and let them forget the Qur'an, and do not forget the Qur'an, and do not forget the Qur'an, they will not be able to destroy their own soul, nor will they have any protector.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall we worship besides Allah that which neither profits us nor does it harm, and who has guided us from Allah's guidance?
“And the prayer (i.e. prayer), and the prayer (prayer), and fear Him, and it is He Who is to you all together.”
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in truth; and the day when He will say, "Be!" and it will be said: "Be!" His words is true; and the day when the trumpet shall be blown, and the earth shall be blown, and He is the Wise, the Wise.
When Ibrahim said to his father Azar, Azar: Do you take idols for gods? Verily, I see you and your people in manifest error.
And thus did We show Ibrahim the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who are sure.
When the night saw the night, he saw a star. He said, "This is my Lord." But when it set up, he said, "I do not love the like of it."
So when he saw the moon rising, he said: "This is my Lord," but when it set, he said: "Unless my Lord guide me, I will surely be among the people who are astray."
But when he saw the sun rising in splendour, he said, "This is my Lord, this is the greatest." But when it came, he said, "My people are like the gods who associate with you."
Indeed, I have turned on my face to Him who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the idolaters.
And his people disputed with him, saying, "Do you dispute with me about Allah, when He guided me, and I fear not to fear what you associate with Him? My Lord comprehends all things in the knowledge of my Lord. Will you not then remember?"
How should I fear what you associate with Him, while you have not fear that you have associated with Allah what He has sent down to you? But if you do not know, then the two parties is better than the two of you.
Those who believe and do not follow their faith, for them are those who are secure and are guided.
And this is Our argument which We gave to Ibrahim (Abraham) to his people. We raise him in degrees whom We please; surely your Lord is Wise, Wise.
And We gave Ibrahim (Isaac) Isaac and Ya'qoob (Jacob), all of them We guided, and We guided Nuh (Noah), and his offspring (Noah), and from his progeny Dawud (Moses) and Harun (Moses) and Harun (Moses) and Harun (Moses) and Harun (Moses) and Harun (Moses) and Harun (Moses). Thus do We reward those who do good.
And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Jesus and Elias, all of them were among the righteous.
And Ishmael, and Elisha, and Jonah, and Lot, and all the people of the worlds.
And We chose them and their fathers, their sons, and their brothers, and We guided them, and We guided them to the straight path.
That is Allah's guidance, He guides whom He wills of His servants, and if they were associated with Him, they would have been destroyed.
These are they who gave the Book and the wisdom and the Prophethood and the Prophethood. If they believe in it, We have made a people a people who disbelieve not.
Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so follow their guidance. Say, "I do not ask of you any reward. This is a reminder for the worlds."
And they did not confer the covenant of Allah with His servant, because they said, "God has sent down all things." Say: "Why did He not send down the Book which He sent down to Moses, and the guidance, and the guidance, and the guidance, and the guidance, and you do not know what you have done?" Say, "God has sent down the Book." Say, "God has sent down the Book." Say, "God has sent down the Book."
And this is a Book which We have sent down to you, confirming that which is before it, and that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it, and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they pray for their prayers.
And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or denies what has been revealed to me, or that which was revealed to me, or said, "I have been sent down to the Book of God," or if you see it, then the angels will fall down upon them, and if you see the angels, they will not be able to stretch your hands on you, and if you see the signs of Allah, then you will be imprisoned.
And indeed, you have come to Us alone as We created you first, and behind you We have left behind you that which We have bestowed on you, and We have not seen your intercessors with you. We see you among the ties of your ties, and you were cut off from your ties.
It is Allah Who splits the grain of grain and the date-stone. He brings forth the dead from the dead, and the living from the dead. That is Allah, how you are turned away.
He causes the dawn to break into the day, and He has made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon; He is the Mighty, the Knowing.
It is He Who has made the stars for you, that you may be guided by the darkness of the land and the sea; indeed We have explained signs for people who understand.
It is He Who created you from a single soul, then has made you a place of rest and a resting place. We have explained signs for people who understand.
And He it is Who sends down water from the sky, then We bring forth therewith of it kinds of plants, and We bring forth therewith kinds of plants from which We bring forth crops, palms, palms, and pomegranates of date-palms, and olives and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, how they are in a sign.
And they associate the jinn with Allah, while He created them, and they attribute to Him a son, and they attribute to Him sons and daughters. Glory be to Him, above what they attribute to Him.
Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth? How can He have a son? He has created it, and He creates all things. He knows all things.
That is Allah, your Lord, there is no god but He, the Creator of all things; so worship Him.
Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives all vision; He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Indeed, there has come to you signs from your Lord; then whoever sees it will be repaid to his own soul; and whoever is blind, it is to his own loss; and I am not a keeper over you.
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of various signs, and they say, "You have studied," and that We may make it clear for people who are people who know.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord; there is no god but He; and turn away from the idolaters.
And if Allah had pleased, they would not have associated others with Him, and We have not made you a keeper over them, and you are not to watch them.
Do not insult those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they insult Allah in ignorance, because of their ignorance. We have made every nation fair-seeming to their Lord, and they will be returned to their Lord, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swear by Allah by their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they would believe in it. Say: "These are signs with Allah." Say: "The signs are with Allah, and they will not believe."
And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes to their eyes, and they will not believe in it, and We will leave them in their insolence in their insolence.
And if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken to them, and all the witnesses were to be gathered before them, they would not have believed before Allah, but most of them were ignorant.
And similarly, We have made every prophet an enemy from among the jinn and the jinn, and some of the devils, who inspire one another with speech, and to inspire one another. And if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them alone.
And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to their hearts, so that they may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with what they do.
Shall I seek other than Allah as a judge? He has sent down to you the Book. Those who have been given the Book know that the Book has been revealed from your Lord. So do not be of those who are doubtful.
And the word of your Lord is in truth and in justice; none can change His words; He is the Hearer, the Knower.
And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from the Path of Allah.
Your Lord knows best who strayed from His Path, and He knows best those who are guided.
If you believe in God, then you have to believe in Him.
And what is the matter with you that you do not eat from the name of Allah when He has made clear to you what has been forbidden to you? And most certainly many of you have gone astray from their own desires. Indeed, your Lord knows best the transgressors.
And forgive the sin of sin and sin, for those who commit evil deeds shall be recompensed for what they have done.
And do not eat of the mention of the name of Allah's name, when it is a crime, and indeed, the Shaitan and the devils inspire the devils to dispute with you, and if you obey them, then you will be Muslims.
Who did We give life and death, and We have made him a light in the darkness of the people, like that which is in the hearts of men? This is what the unbelievers have made to do, that is what they do.
And thus have We destroyed in every city many of the criminals, in order that they may conspire in it, and they do not scheme against themselves, but they do not know.
And when a sign comes to them, they say, "We will not believe until the Messenger of Allah has been given to him, until he is given the Messenger of Allah." Allah knows what is wrong for His servants, and a severe punishment will afflict those who are guilty.
And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills to err, He makes his breast narrow and constricted as if he were climbing up into the sky.
This is the straight path from your Lord. We have explained Our signs for a people who remember.
They will be rewarded with their Lord in Paradise, and He is their Protector.
On the Day when He will gather them all together, He will say, "O people of jinn, many of you have been oppressed by the people of the jinn, and the people will say to them, ‘Our Lord, we have given you some of us.’ He will say, “Your fire is hell, you shall abide therein forever.” Your Lord is Wise, Knowing.
And thus do We make the wrongdoers one of those who do wrong for others.
O assembly of jinn and men, did not messengers come to you from among you, reciting to you My signs and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours? They will say, "We bear witness against them, and the life of this world." They will bear witness against themselves, and they will bear witness against themselves.
That is because your Lord did not destroy the towns unjustly, because their people were unaware.
And they are ranks according to what they have done, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
Your Lord is Self-sufficient, the Self-sufficient, the All-Merciful. If He willed, He will destroy you, and He will make you successors, and He will make you successors from the other people.
Verily, the promise which you are promised will come to you, and you will not escape.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Work according to your own deeds (i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., i.e., in the Hereafter).
And they assign to Allah a share of the crops which Allah has created and cattle, and they say, "This is for Allah," and they say, "This is for Allah." And they say, "This is because Allah is our associates."
And certainly many of the idolaters have made their deeds fair-seeming to their children, that they may cause them to destroy their own souls, and that their religion may cause them to grow in their religion; and if Allah had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them in what they invent.
And they say, "Tales of cattle and cattle, except for the cattle, except that which we please, except for whom we please, and they say, ‘There is no animal for them, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, they do not mention Allah's name.'
And they say: "Whatever is in the wombs of the cattle is for our males, and the males is forbidden for our males; and if they die, they shall be in all things; and if they die, they shall be in all things."
Those who have lost their children without knowledge, without knowledge, without knowledge, and what Allah has provided for them, they invent a lie against Allah, and they have gone astray. They have gone astray.
And He it is Who produces the gardens and the gardens and the gardens, and the date-palms, and the crops, and the olive, and the olive, and the olive, and the olive, and the olive, and the olive, and the harvest, and the harvest of the harvest; and do not waste the due of the God of the wasteful.
And for the cattle is a burden for you and the earth, and eat of what Allah has provided for you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your enemy.
[20:22] And of the camels, and of the two of them, both of the two of them, and of the two of them, or the two of them, or the females, or the females, or the two females?
And of the camels and of the camels, or of the camels, or the two males, or the males, or the two females, or the two of the two females, or when Allah had enjoined upon you? And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah? And he who invents a lie against Allah is unjust. Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): "It is not lawful for me to eat in that which has been revealed to me (i.e. the Qur'an) in which has been sent down to him, except that he dies, or blood, or the blood of swine, or the blood of swine, or the blood of swine, or that which is in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful."
And (as for) those who were killed, We forbade the animal of all kinds of animals, and We forbade them from the fat of their backs, and of the fat of their backs, or the entrails that struck them, or the entrails of their backs; and We punished them for their deeds, and We are the truthful.
But if they belie you, say, "Your Lord is the Lord of all mercy, and His punishment will not be averted from the guilty people."
The idolaters will say, "Had Allah willed, we would not have worshipped idols, nor our fathers, nor did we have forbidden any other thing." Likewise, those who lived before them did not deny Our punishment until they tasted Our punishment. Say, "Bring us to us."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The affair is with Allah, if He had willed, He would have guided you all."
Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): "Say to those who bear witness to their witnesses (i.e. the Qur'an), if they bear witness (to the truth), then do not bear witness with them, nor do they bear witness with them, and those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of the Hereafter, and those who do not believe in the Hereafter.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Tell me what your Lord has forbidden you.” Say, “Do not associate anything with Him, and do not associate your parents with Him, and do not kill your parents. Do not kill your children, and do not kill your children. And do not take your hands from yourselves, except what Allah has forbidden you. This is what God has revealed to you. This is what God has given you, so that you may understand.”
And do not approach the property of the orphan, except the best of the good, until the age of its age comes to pass, and give full measure and weight, and give full measure, and do not burden any human being. And when you speak words, then give it to you. And Allah has given you His covenant, so that you may remember.
“And verily, this is My Straight Path, so follow it, follow it, and follow not other paths, for they will mislead you from His Path.”
“Then We gave Moses the Book, complete for him who does good, and explaining everything, and a guidance and a mercy, so that they might believe in their Lord.”
“And this is a Book which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur’an), so follow it, so follow it and fear Allah.”
Lest you should say, "The Book has been sent down to two parties before us, and we were unaware of his study."
Or lest you should say, "If the Book had been sent down to us, we would certainly have followed them better than they have been guided." Indeed, there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy from your Lord, who denies the signs of Allah and turns away from them. Those who turn away from Our signs will have a painful punishment.
Are they waiting for the coming to them that come to them from the angels, or from your Lord, or from your Lord, or from your Lord's signs? On the Day of Resurrection there will be a sign for a man who believes not, nor does they believe. Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait." Say, "Wait."
Those who divide their religion and break up into sects, you have no portion of them; their affair is with Allah; then He will inform them of what they used to do.
Whoever brings a good deed shall be like a like like the like thereof; and whoever does evil, it is like a good deed, and they shall not be wronged.
Say, "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, the right religion, the religion of Abraham, the upright, the upright."
Say, "My prayer and my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
He has no partner, and I am the first of those who submit to Him.
Say: "Shall I seek other than Allah as Lord, and He is the Lord of all things; and every soul shall bear no burden except by Him; and the soul shall bear no burden from the soul; then you shall be returned to your Lord."
And He it is Who has made you inheritors of the earth, and He raised some of you above others, so that He might test you in what He has given you. Your Lord is swift in punishment, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
Alif, Lam.
The Book has come to you (O Muhammad SAW), so that you may warn the people (i.e. the Qur'an) to you (O Muhammad SAW), so that you may warn it with your heart, and as a reminder for the believers.
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow the guardians of Him, and do not follow the desires of those who are mindful.
And how many a township We destroyed, but Our punishment came to them, or they were sleeping at night.
But when Our punishment came to them, they said, "We were wrongdoers."
Then We will question those to whom the Messengers were sent, and We will question the messengers.
Then We shall inform them of what We have revealed to them, and We have not been absent.
On that day the truth will be true, and those whose scales are heavy will be successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, they are those who have ruined Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) because they used to destroy Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).
And indeed We have established you in the earth, and made for you a means of livelihood, and made for you a livelihood.
And certainly We created you, then fashioned you, then We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam”, then We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam.”
He said, "What prevented you from what you say?" He said, "I am better than you." He said, "I am better than you, You created me from fire, and You created him from clay."
He said: Get it down from the sky, it is not for you to be arrogant; so go forth from them; surely you are of the losers.
He said, "Allow me respite till the Day of Resurrection."
He said, “You are of the reprieved.”
He said, “You have led me astray because of Your guidance.”
Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them, and from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them grateful.”
He said, "Get away from the heaven, you expelled, and I will fill you with all those who follow you."
“And O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat of it wherever ye will, but do not approach this tree, lest ye be of the wrongdoers.”
Then Satan whispered to them, that he might show them what was hidden from them of their shame, and he said: Your Lord did not prevent you from this tree, lest he should become angels or you shall live.
And he swore to them, saying, "I am indeed a sincere adviser."
So they broke them with deceit, so they tasted the news of the tree, and when they tasted the tree of the garden, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to go forth from the Garden, and their Lord called to them, saying, "Did I not forbid you from that tree?"
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will certainly be among the losers."
He said: Go forth, you are enemies of one another. And for you is the abode of the earth, and a provision for the earth and for a while.
He said: "Therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought forth."
O Children of Adam! We have sent down to you a garment of clothing, and the adornment of your garment, and the garment of piety, and the garment of piety; this is the best of the signs of Allah; so that they may remember.
O children of Adam, let not Satan seduce you, as he got your parents out of the garden, stripping them of their raiment, stripping them of their shame, that he might show them their shame, and he sees him from his tribe; they do not see those who believe, and We have made the devils a friend.
And when they commit an indecency, they say, “We found our fathers doing, and Allah has commanded us.” Say, “God does not command indecency.” Say, “God does not command indecency concerning what you do.”
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has commanded justice (i.e. the religion of Islamic Monotheism), and that you turn your faces at every place (of worship), and invoke Him in prayer (i.e. worship Him) and worship Him (Alone), and He created you in the first state (of worship)."
He has guided the people, and some of them have deserved error; because they have taken the devils instead of Allah, and they think that they are guided.
O Children of Adam, eat your adornment, and eat and drink, and do not waste, but do not be wasteful.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the good things, and the sustenance of the good things?" Say: "They are on the Day of Resurrection, on the Day of Resurrection, for those who believe and do not believe."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has only prohibited indecencies, that which is apparent, and that which is concealed, and all that is concealed, and sin, and wrong-doing, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority."
“And for every nation is a term appointed; when their term comes, they shall not be able to delay a single hour, nor shall they be brought before it.”
O Children of Adam! Whenever there come to you apostles from among you, rehearsing unto you My signs, then those who fear Allah and do good, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or denies His signs, and who denies His signs? And when Our messengers will come to them, they will say, "Where is the call of Allah?" They will say, "When will you call upon Allah, and bear witness against them?" They will say, "Yes," they will bear witness to it.
He will say, "Enter the fire, the fire of Hell before you, when the people of the nations were destroyed before you, and when a group of them will be destroyed, it will be exposed to them, and when they will enter it, it will be said to them, 'Our Lord, our Lord has led us astray.' He will say, "There is double punishment."
And the first of them will say to the last of them, "You are not superior to us, so taste the punishment for what you used to earn."
Those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will not enter the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the Garden until the camel opens the needle, and thus do We requite the guilty.
For them shall be a couch of fire, and from above them, and from above them shall be a covering, and thus do We recompense those who do wrong.
And as for those who believe and do good, We do not burden any soul beyond his capacity; these are the dwellers of the Garden; they shall abide therein forever.
And We shall remove from them what is in their hearts, and rivers flow beneath beneath them, and they will say, "Praise be to Allah, Who has guided us. Had Allah not guided us, we would not have been guided." The Messenger of our Lord came to them from the truth, and they called to the truth.
And the dwellers of the Garden will call to the dwellers of the Fire, saying: "We have indeed found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised to be true?" They will say, "Yes!" Then they will say, "God is the curse of the wrongdoers."
Those who bar from the Path of Allah, and seek to make it crooked, and they are not in the Hereafter.
And there shall be a barrier between them, and the dwellers of the Elevations, and the dwellers of the Elevations will say to them, "Peace be upon each of them," and they call out to the dwellers of the Garden; they will not be able to enter it.
