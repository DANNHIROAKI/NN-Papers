# Dataset or Not?

This directory contains a colab that allows you to train the models from the paper [Dataset or Not? A study on the veracity of semantic markup for dataset pages](go/dataset-or-not).

Open the notebook in Colab with this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/dataset_or_not/dataset_or_not.ipynb).

NOTE: We modified some parts of the architecture for releasing on Colab.
