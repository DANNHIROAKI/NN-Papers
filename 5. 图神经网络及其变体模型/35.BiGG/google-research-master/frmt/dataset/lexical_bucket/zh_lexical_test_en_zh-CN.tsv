The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on 17 December 1997.	1997 年 12 月 17 日，约恩·巴格尔创造了“网络博客”一词。
The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.	“博客”一词的创造者是彼得·默霍尔兹。1999 年 4 月或 5 月时，他开玩笑地将 weblog 一词拆分成短句“we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com”。
Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.	不久后，Pyra Labs 的埃文·威廉姆斯将“blog”一词作为名词和动词使用（“to blog”意思是“编辑某个人的博客或在某个人的博客上发帖”），并为 Pyra Labs' Blogger 产品设计了“博主”一词，该词迅速流行起来。
Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists, and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).	在博客流行起来之前，数字社区有多种形式，包括 Usenet、如 GEnie、Byte information Exchange (BIX) 和早期的CompuServe 等商业线上服务、邮件列表以及 Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)。
In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running conversations with "threads".	20 世纪 90 年代，互联网论坛软件使用“线程”创造出持续的对话。
Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard".	线程是虚拟“软木板”上消息之间的局部连接。
From 14 June 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What’s New" list of new websites, updated daily and archived monthly.	1993 年 6 月 14 日起，Mosaic Communications Corporation 每天都会更新新网站的“最新动态”列表，并且每月都会进行存档。
The page was accessible by a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web browser.	可以点击 Mosaic 网页浏览器的“最新动态”特殊按钮进入该页面。
The earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web site created in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured a blog in a section called "Online Diary".	最早的商业博客是 Ty, Inc. 于 1995 年创建的首个企业对消费者网站，其中“线上日记”部分设有博客。
The entries were maintained by featured Beanie Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.	豆豆娃负责维护入口，每月由网站访客选出。
The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives.	现代博客来源于人们持续记录个人生活中事件的线上日记。
Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers.	大部分这种作者都称呼自己为日记记录者。
Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle.	1994 年，贾斯汀·霍尔还是斯沃斯莫尔学院的学生时就开始记录个人博客，他被普遍公认为最早的博主之一，杰里·波内尔也是其中一位。
Dave Winer's Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs.	戴夫·温特尔的 Scripting News 也被认为是更早开始的网络博客之一。

This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters.	这种结合实时视频和文字的半自动化博客被称为穿戴式监视，这种日记也可作为法律问题中的证据使用。
Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.	在博客一词普遍使用之前，有些早期的博主，如 1997 年开始的 Misanthropic Bitch，称呼他们在网上发布的内容为电子杂志。
Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites.	早期的博客只是普通网站上手动更新的内容。
In 1995, the "Online Diary" on the Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available.	1995 年，在博客程序出现以前，Ty, Inc. 网站创建了“线上日记”并进行手动更新。
Posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating text based HTML code using FTP software in real time several times a day.	帖子按从新到旧的顺序显示，每天数次实时使用 FTP 软件手动更新 HTML 编码文本。
To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day.	在用户看来，这像每天包含多条新纪录的实时日记。
At the beginning of each new day, new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file, and the start of each month, diary entries were archived into its own folder which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month.	新的一天开始时，新的日记记录会被手动编码成新的 HTML 文件。每个月开始时，日记记录会存入包含一个月内每一天单独的 HTML 页面的文件夹中。
Then menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site.	然后，手动更新网站上包含最新日记记录链接的菜单。
This text-based method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later.	这种用文本整理数千份文件的方法为未来的博客提供了跳板，数年后会使用博客软件来管理博客。
The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger and less technically-inclined population.	电子和软件工具的发展可以方便编写和维护按从新到旧顺序发表的网络文章，让更多对技术不太精通的人能够学会发表文章的过程。
Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today.	最终，这产生了独特的线上发表方式，由此出现今天我们认识的博客。
For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging".	例如，使用某些以浏览器为基础的软件就是如今典型的“发博客”。
Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, on regular web hosting services, or run using blog software.	博客可以由专门的博客主机服务进行托管，在常规网络主机服务上托管，或通过博客软件运行。
An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.	2002 年是博客重要性崛起的早期里程碑，当时许多博主非常关注美国参议院多数党领导人特伦特·洛特的言论。
Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president.	隶属纪念美国参议员斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德的党派的参议员洛特赞扬了参议员瑟蒙德，还表示如果以前瑟蒙德能当选总统，美国可能会比现在更好。
Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign.	洛特的批评家认为这些言论表示对种族隔离的赞同，种族隔离是瑟蒙德在 1948 年总统选举中提出的政策。
This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers.	这一观点在博主们挖掘的文件和采访录音中得到证实。
(See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.)	（详见约什·马歇尔谈话要点备忘录。）
Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.	虽然洛特在众多媒体参加的公共活动中发表这些言论，但直到博主挖掘出这些事情后，媒体才对他的争议性言论进行大肆报道。
Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.	博客促发了一场政治危机，迫使洛特辞去多数党领导人一职。
Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the "Rathergate" scandal.	同样，博客也是“拉瑟门”丑闻背后的推动力之一。
To wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show 60 Minutes) that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's military service record.	即：（电视记者）丹·拉瑟（在 CBS 的《60 分钟》节目中）展示的文件与公认的布什总统服役记录相矛盾。
Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view.	博主们声称文件是伪造的，并展示出支持该观点的证据和论据。
Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see Little Green Footballs).	因此，CBS 为其所谓的报道技巧不足而道歉（详见 Little Green Footballs）。
Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.	许多博主认为这次的丑闻揭开了媒体接受博客的序幕，博客不仅可以作为新闻的来源和建议，还可以作为施加政治压力的方式。
The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination.	这些故事带来的影响让博客成为更可靠的新闻传播媒介。
Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead.	虽然博客常被视为党派八卦，但有时博主会首先公开关键信息，而主流媒体必须跟随他们的脚步。
More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.	但新博客更常对主流媒体已发布的材料作出反应。
Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis.	同时，越来越多的专家成为博主，博客也因此成为深度分析的来源。
In Russia, some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official, overwhelmingly pro-government media.	在俄罗斯，有的政治博主开始挑战官方亲政府媒体的领导地位。
Bloggers such as Rustem Adagamov and Alexei Navalny have many followers and the latter's nickname for the ruling United Russia party as the "party of crooks and thieves" has been adopted by anti-regime protesters.	Rustem Adagamov 和阿列克谢·纳瓦利内等博主有许多粉丝，后者还为执政的统一俄罗斯党起了一个别称叫“骗子和小偷的党派”，这个别称被反政府抗议者采用。
This led to the Wall Street Journal calling Navalny "the man Vladimir Putin fears most" in March 2012.	因此，2012 年 3 月，《华尔街日报》称纳瓦利内是“弗拉基米尔·普京最害怕的男人”。
By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as political consultants, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming.	到 2004 年，博客逐渐占据主流地位，政治顾问、新服务和候选人都开始使用博客作为接触群众和形成观点的工具。

(See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK's Labour Party's MP Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents.	（详见霍华德·迪安和韦斯利·克拉克。）甚至政客也没那么积极地举办选举活动，例如英国工党国会议员汤姆·沃森开始用博客与选民交流。
In January 2005, Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people "could not ignore": Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.	2005 年 1 月，《财富》杂志列出了八位商界人士“无法忽视”的博主：彼得·罗哈斯、谢尼·雅尔丹、本·托罗特、梅娜·托罗特、乔纳森·施瓦茨、杰森·戈德曼、罗伯特·斯考伯和杰森·卡拉卡尼斯。

The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments.	博客对主流媒体的影响也得到了政府的认可。
In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area.	2009 年，随着多家报纸公司申请破产，美国新闻业的主导地位逐渐下降，导致同一发行领域的报纸之间的直接竞争减少。
Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government.	人们开始讨论联邦政府的刺激政策是否对报纸业有益处。
U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying "if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”.	美国总统贝拉克·奥巴马承认博客对社会日益增长的影响力，他表示“如果新闻的发展方向只是博客空间，只是各种意见，不经过严格的事实查证，不严肃地讲出前因后果，最终只会变成人们互相大喊，而无法互相理解”。
Between 2009 and 2012, an Orwell Prize for blogging was awarded.	2009 年至 2012 年都为博客颁发了奥威尔奖。
Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in participatory journalism, are amateur journalists, and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in mainstream media organizations.	许多博主，特别是参与式新闻博主，都是业余记者，因此他们把自己与在主流媒体工作的专业记者和编辑区分开来。
Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online, rather than via a TV station or newspaper, either as an add-on to a traditional media presence (e.g., hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper), or as their sole journalistic output.	其他博主是媒体专业人士，他们在网上发布，而不是在电视或报纸上发布内容，这可能是他们对传统媒体（如主持电台节目或在纸质报纸上写专栏）的补充，或是他们唯一输出新闻的地方。
Some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" of media "gatekeepers" and pushing their messages directly to the public.	有的机构和组织把博客视为“绕开”媒体“守门员”的方式，可以直接向公众推送信息。
Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list.	同时，许多主流记者都会写自己的博客，根据 CyberJournalist.net 的记者博客名单，数量超过 300 个。
The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.	1998 年 8 月，首次在新闻网站上使用博客，当时《夏洛特观察家》的乔纳森·杜比发表了飓风邦尼记录。

Blogs have also had an influence on minority languages, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in Gaelic languages.	博客也影响了小语种，把分散的讲和学这些语言的人聚集起来；盖尔语博客就是一个突出的例子。
Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.	小语种出版业（缺乏经济可行性）可以通过成本低的博客找到其受众。

Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts.	在各种博客广告模式中，最具争议性的就是赞助帖。

In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration.	在多伊起诉卡希尔的案件中，特拉华州最高法院认为揭露匿名博主身份时必须要遵守严格的标准，还采取了非同寻常的措施，驳回诽谤案件（根据美国诽谤法，这是没有根据的），而不是将其发回初审法庭重新审议。
In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival.	奇怪的是，卡希尔夫妇获得了约翰·多伊的身份，结果发现正是他们怀疑的人。多伊是该镇的镇长，也是议员卡希尔的政治对手。

In the US, in 1986, the Pineapple Research Institute was dissolved and its assets divided between Del Monte and Maui Land and Pineapple.	1986 年在美国，菠萝研究机构解散，其资产被德尔蒙和 Maui Land and Pineapple 瓜分。
Del Monte took cultivar '73–114', dubbed 'MD-2', to its plantations in Costa Rica, found it to be well-suited to growing there, and launched it publicly in 1996 as 'Gold Extra Sweet', while Del Monte also began marketing '73–50', dubbed 'CO-2', as 'Del Monte Gold'.	德尔蒙把名为“MD-2”的“73-114”品种带到了哥斯达黎加种植园，发现它很适合在那里生长，并于 1996 年以“黄金特甜”称号公开发售，同时德尔蒙也开始推广名为“CO-2”的“73-50”品种，称其为“德尔蒙黄金”。
Dole ceased its cannery operations in Honolulu in 1991, and in 2008, Del Monte terminated its pineapple-growing operations in Hawaii.	1991 年，都乐关闭了在檀香山的罐头工厂。2008 年，德尔蒙终止了在夏威夷的菠萝种植产业。
In 2009, the Maui Pineapple Company reduced its operations to supply pineapples only locally on Maui, and by 2013, only the Dole Plantation on Oahu grew pineapples in a volume of about 0.1 percent of the world's production.	2009 年，Maui Pineapple Company 缩小经营规模，只在毛伊岛本地供应菠萝。到了 2013 年，只有都乐在欧胡岛的种植园仍在种植菠萝，产量占全球产量的 0.1%。
The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were also traditionally widely cultivated in the Philippines for the textile industry from at least the 17th century.	至少从 17 世纪开始，“红西班牙”品种的菠萝在菲律宾广泛种植。
They were originally brought to the islands from Latin America during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines.	在西班牙殖民菲律宾时期，他们最初被从拉丁美洲带到岛上。
Smooth Cayenne' was later introduced in the early 1900s by the Bureau of Agriculture during the American colonial period.	20 世纪早期，在美国殖民时期，农业局引进了“无刺卡因”品种。
Dole and Del Monte also established plantations in the island of Mindanao in the 1920s; in the provinces of Cotabato and Bukidnon, respectively.	20 世纪 20 年代，都乐和德尔蒙也在棉兰老岛上开设种植园，分别是哥打巴托省和布基农省。
The Philippines remain one of the top exporters of pineapples in the world.	菲律宾仍然是世界上菠萝出口量最大的国家之一。
The Del Monte plantations are now locally managed, after Del Monte Pacific Ltd., a Filipino company, completed the purchase of Del Monte Foods in 2014.	2014 年，一家菲律宾公司德尔蒙太平洋有限公司完成了对德尔蒙食品的收购。现在，德尔蒙种植园由当地管理。
The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were once extensively cultivated in the Philippines.	“红西班牙”品种的菠萝曾在菲律宾广泛种植。
The long leaves of the cultivar were the source of traditional piña fibers, an adaptation of the native weaving traditions with fibers extracted from abacá.	该品种的长叶是传统 piña 纤维的来源，改变了当地用 abacá 纤维纺织的传统。
These were woven into lustrous lace-like nipis fabrics usually decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado.	它们被织成类似于蕾丝的有光泽的织物，通常装饰有名为 calado 和 sombrado 的复杂花卉刺绣。
The fabric was a luxury export from the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period and gained favor among European aristocracy in the 18th and 19th centuries.	在西班牙殖民时期，这种布料是菲律宾出口的奢侈品，并在 18 世纪和 19 世纪获得欧洲贵族的喜爱。
Domestically, they were used to make the traditional barong Tagalog, baro't saya, and traje de mestiza clothing of the Filipino upper class, as well as women's kerchiefs (pañuelo).	在国内，它们被用来制作传统的 barong Tagalog、baro't saya、菲律宾上层社会穿着的 traje de mestiza clothing 以及女性的 kerchiefs (pañuelo)。
They were favored for their light and breezy quality, which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands.	它们因轻便透气受到欢迎，非常适合岛屿上的热带炎热气候。
The industry was destroyed in the Second World War and is only starting to be revived.	该产业在第二次世界大战中被破坏，刚刚开始恢复。
In 2017, world production of pineapples was 27.4 million tons, led by Costa Rica, the Philippines, Brazil, and Thailand as the largest producers.	2017 年，全球菠萝产量为 2740 万吨，最大的生产国是哥斯达黎加、菲律宾、巴西和泰国。
In commercial farming, flowering can be induced artificially, and the early harvesting of the main fruit can encourage the development of a second crop of smaller fruits.	在商业种植中，可以人工诱导开花，而且收获早期的主要果实可以促进第二波较小果实的生长。
Once removed during cleaning, the top of the pineapple can be planted in soil and a new plant will grow.	清洁时去掉菠萝头后，可以把菠萝头种在土里，就会长出新的植物。
Three-quarters of the pineapples sold in Europe are grown in Costa Rica, where pineapple production is highly industrialised.	欧洲售卖的菠萝中有四分之三都产自哥斯达黎加，这里的菠萝生产已高度工业化。
Growers typically use 20 kg (44 lb) of pesticides per hectare in each growing cycle, a process that may affect soil quality and biodiversity.	种植者通常在每个生长周期会使用每公顷 20 千克（44 磅）农药，这个过程可能会影响土壤质量和生物多样性。
The pesticides—organophosphates, organochlorines, and hormone disruptors—have the potential to affect workers' health and can contaminate local drinking water supplies.	有机磷、有机氯和激素干扰物等农药可能会影响工人的健康以及污染当地饮水供应。
Many of these chemicals have potential to be carcinogens, and may be related to birth defects.	许多化学物质都可能是致癌物质，还可能会导致先天性缺陷。
Because of commercial pressures, many pineapple workers in Costa Rica—60% of whom are Nicaraguan—are paid low wages.	由于贸易压力大，哥斯达黎加的许多菠萝工人（60% 是尼加拉瓜人）工资微薄。
European supermarkets' price-reduction policies have lowered growers' incomes.	欧洲超市的减价政策导致种植者收入减少。
One major pineapple producer contests these claims.	一个主要菠萝生产商要求索赔。
Pineapple fruits and peels contain diverse phytochemicals, among which are polyphenols, including gallic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and arbutin.	菠萝的果实和果皮中含有多种植物生化素，其中多酚类物质包括没食子酸、丁香酸、香兰素、阿魏酸、芥子酸、对香豆酸、绿原酸、儿茶素和熊果苷。
Present in all parts of the pineapple plant, bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes.	菠萝蛋白酶存在于菠萝植物的各个部位，是一种蛋白水解酶的混合物。
Bromelain is under preliminary research for a variety of clinical disorders, but to date has not been adequately defined for its effects in the human body.	现正针对多种临床疾病对菠萝蛋白酶进行初步研究，但迄今为止尚未充分确定它对人体的效果。
Bromelain may be unsafe for some users, such as in pregnancy, allergies, or anticoagulation therapy.	菠萝蛋白酶对部分用户而言可能不安全，例如孕妇、过敏患者或接受抗凝治疗的患者。
If having sufficient bromelain content, raw pineapple juice may be useful as a meat marinade and tenderizer.	如果生菠萝汁有足够的菠萝蛋白酶，可能与腌肉料和嫩肉剂有同样效果。
Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as gelatin-based desserts or gel capsules, their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning.	虽然菠萝酶会影响某些食物或工业产品的制备，例如用明胶制作的甜点或凝胶胶囊，但是这种特性的蛋白水解活动可能会在烹饪和装罐期间得到减轻。
The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing.	特定份量的菠萝果实可能不会含有大量菠萝蛋白酶，但在家庭和工业加工时可以使用某些提取方法获得足够份量的菠萝蛋白酶。
Pineapples are subject to a variety of diseases, the most serious of which is wilt disease vectored by mealybugs typically found on the surface of pineapples, but possibly in the closed blossom cups.	菠萝容易感染多种疾病，其中最严重的是由粉蚧传播的枯萎病，粉蚧通常存在于菠萝的表面，但也有可能存在于封闭的花杯中。
Other diseases include citrus pink disease, bacterial heart rot, anthracnose, fungal heart rot, root rot, black rot, butt rot, fruitlet core rot, and yellow spot virus.	其他疾病包括柑橘赤衣病、细菌心腐病、炭疽病、真菌心腐病、根腐病、黑腐病、基腐病、果实小核腐烂病和黄花斑点病毒。
Pineapple pink disease (not citrus pink disease) is characterized by the fruit developing a brownish to black discoloration when heated during the canning process.	菠萝赤衣病（非柑橘赤衣病）的特点是，在装罐过程中果实表面会出现棕黑色的斑点。
The causal agents of pink disease are the bacteria Acetobacter aceti, Gluconobacter oxydans, Pantoea citrea.	赤衣病的病原体包括醋酸杆菌、氧化葡萄糖杆菌、柠檬泛菌。
and Tatumella ptyseos.	和痰塔特姆氏菌。
Some pests that commonly affect pineapple plants are scales, thrips, mites, mealybugs, ants, and symphylids.	通常会影响菠萝植物的害虫包括蚧壳虫、蓟马、螨虫、粉蚧、蚂蚁和综合纲。
Heart-rot is the most serious disease affecting pineapple plants.	心腐病是影响菠萝植物最严重的疾病。
The disease is caused by Phytophthora cinnamoni and P. parasitica, fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions.	该疾病由樟疫霉和寄生疫霉引起，这两种真菌通常会影响生长在潮湿环境的菠萝。
Since it is difficult to treat, it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available; all suckers that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide, since the fungus enters through the wounds.	由于疾病难以治疗，因此建议在有条件的地方种植抗病品种来避免感染；所有繁殖所需的根出条都应浸泡杀真菌剂，因为真菌会通过伤口进入。
Some buyers prefer green fruit, others ripened or off-green.	有的买手喜欢绿色的果实，而其他买手喜欢成熟或者不绿的果实。
A plant growth regulator, Ethephon, is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest, developing ethylene, which turns the fruit golden yellow.	通常会在收获前一周时往果实上喷洒植物生长调节剂乙烯利，乙烯利能够使果实变成金黄色。
After cleaning and slicing, a pineapple is typically canned in sugar syrup with added preservative.	清洁和切片后，菠萝通常会与糖浆和防腐剂一起装罐。
A pineapple never becomes any riper than it was when harvested.	菠萝会一直保持收获时的成熟状态。
The fruit itself is quite perishable and if it is stored at room temperature, it should be used within two days; however, if it is refrigerated, the time span extends to 5–7 days.	水果本身容易腐烂，如果存放在室温条件下，应该在两天内食用完毕；但是如果存放在冰箱内，保质期可延长至 5—7 天。
Mimi Sheller writes: "The pineapple entered European iconography as a symbol of welcome and hospitality, and also eventually found its way into botanical gardens such as the Chelsea Physic Garden, where it was grown in heated pits." The sweet fruit had a "mysterious aura" in the Age of Sail because except for a "small elite with access to glass hothouses", tropical fruits could only be tasted where they were cultivated.	米米·雪勒写到：“欧洲人最初认为菠萝象征着热情好客，菠萝最终还被种在切尔西草药园等植物园的温室中。”这种甜甜的水果在航海时代有“神秘的光环”，因为除了“少数拥有玻璃温室的贵族外”，只有在当地才能品尝到热带水果。
Christopher Cumo writes that "The Spanish who followed Columbus delighted in eating pineapple and in writing about it for a European public eager to learn of the flora and fauna of the Americas ...	克里斯托弗·库莫写道：“那些跟随着哥伦布的西班牙人喜欢吃菠萝和为欧洲公众描写与菠萝有关的信息。他们渴望了解美洲的动植物……
The pineapple was first a luxury because transit from the tropics to Europe was expensive in the age of sail.	菠萝最初是奢侈品，因为在航海时代把菠萝从热带送到欧洲的成本非常昂贵。
In this respect, pineapple was much like sugar, a commodity of privilege before it became an item of the masses." Cumo writes that "pineapple was the fruit of colonialism" because the Portuguese, French, Dutch, and British all sought to establish pineapple plantations in the tropics of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.	因此，在菠萝成为大众商品前，它就像糖一样，是贵族商品。”库莫写道，“菠萝是殖民主义的水果”，因为葡萄牙人、法国人、荷兰人和英国人都试图在南美、中美和加勒比海的热带地区建造菠萝种植园。
In architecture, pineapple figures are a decorative element symbolizing hospitality.	在建筑领域，菠萝是一种象征热情好客的装饰元素。
Usually in plaster or carved wood, pineapples images occur in finials, pendants,"broken" pediments, and door knockers.	菠萝装饰的材质通常是塑料或雕木，出现在尖顶饰、吊坠、“破”山形墙饰和门环上。
Pineapples have long been associated with the Hawaiian Islands, to the extent that the pineapple is sometimes used as a symbol of Hawaii, despite the decline of the pineapple industry in that state.	人们一直都把菠萝与夏威夷岛关联起来，即使夏威夷的菠萝产业已经没落，菠萝有时仍被视为夏威夷的标志。
Foods with pineapple in them are sometimes known as "Hawaiian" for this reason alone.	仅仅出于这个原因，用菠萝制作的食物有时会被冠上“夏威夷”的名字。
A roller coaster is a type of amusement ride that employs a form of elevated railroad track designed with tight turns, steep slopes, and sometimes inversions.	过山车是一种采用高架铁轨形式的游乐设施，设计有急转弯、陡坡，有时还有翻转。
People ride along the track in open cars, and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world.	人们坐在敞篷车厢里乘坐过山车，全球各地的游乐场和主题公园通常都有过山车。
LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained one of the first known patents for a roller coaster design in 1885, related to the Switchback Railway that opened a year earlier at Coney Island.	拉马库斯·阿德纳·汤普森于 1885 年获得了最早一批的过山车专利，该专利涉及一年前在科尼岛开幕的 Switchback Railway 过山车。
The track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate.	像穿梭过山车一样，过山车的轨道不一定是一个完整的回圈。
Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained.	大多数过山车都有多节车厢，乘客会绑好安全带坐在里面。
Two or more cars hooked together are called a train.	两节或以上的车厢连接在一起被称为列车。
Some roller coasters, notably Wild Mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.	部分过山车（如野鼠过山车）以单节车厢运行。
The oldest roller coasters are believed to have originated from the so-called "Russian Mountains", specially constructed hills of ice located in the area that is now Saint Petersburg, Russia.	据说最古老的过山车起源于所谓的“俄罗斯山”，这是一种特别建造的冰山，位于今俄罗斯圣彼得堡。
Built in the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between 21 and 24 m (70 and 80 feet), had a 50-degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.	这座山建于 17 世纪，高度介于 21 到 24 米（70 到 80 英尺）之间，倾斜度为 50 度，有木质结构支撑。
Later, in 1784, Catherine the Great is said to have constructed a sledding hill in the gardens of her palace at Oranienbaum in St. Petersburg.	后来，据说在 1784 年，叶卡捷琳娜二世在位于圣彼得堡的奥拉宁鲍姆宫建造了一座雪橇山。
The name Russian Mountains to designate a roller coaster is preserved in many languages (e.g. the Spanish montaña rusa), but the Russian term for roller coasters is американские горки ("amerikanskiye gorki"), which translates to "American mountains."	许多语言仍使用俄罗斯山指代过山车（如西班牙语的 montaña rusa），但过山车在俄语中是 американские горки（“amerikanskiye gorki”），意思是“美国山”。
The first modern roller coaster, the Promenades Aeriennes, opened in Parc Beaujon in Paris on July 8, 1817.	第一座现代过山车名为 Promenades Aeriennes，于 1817 年 7 月 8 日在巴黎的 Parc Beaujon 开幕。
It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds.	其特点是车厢的轮子会牢牢地卡在轨道上，导轨会确保列车在正确轨道上运行，而且速度更快。
It spawned half a dozen imitators, but their popularity soon declined.	它引来了六个模仿者，但很快就不流行了。
However, during the Belle Epoque they returned to fashion.	但在美好年代时期又流行起来。
In 1887 French entrepreneur Joseph Oller, co-founder of the Moulin Rouge music hall, constructed the Montagnes Russes de Belleville, "Russian Mountains of Belleville" with 656 feet (200 m) of track laid out in a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.	1887 年，法国企业家、红磨坊音乐厅联合创始人约瑟夫·奥勒建造了 Montagnes Russes de Belleville（“贝尔维尔俄罗斯山”），轨道总长 656 英尺（200 米），以双 8 形铺设，然后扩大成四个 8 形圆环。
In 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway, a downhill gravity railroad used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania – now known as Jim Thorpe.	1827 年，位于宾夕法尼亚州萨米特希尔的一家矿业公司建造了 Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway 铁路，这是一条下坡重力铁路，用于把煤运往宾夕法尼亚州 Mauch Chunk（今吉姆索普）。
By the 1850s, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers.	到 19 世纪 50 年代，人们熟知的“重力之路”开始向寻求刺激的人提供游乐设施。
Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.	铁路公司在乘坐人数较少的时候用类似的铁路提供娱乐。
Using this idea as a basis, LaMarcus Adna Thompson began work on a gravity Switchback Railway that opened at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, in 1884. Passengers climbed to the top of a platform and rode a bench-like car down the 600-foot (183 m) track up to the top of another tower where the vehicle was switched to a return track and the passengers took the return trip.	以这个想法为基础，拉马库斯·阿德纳·汤普森开始建造一座重力 Switchback Railway，并于 1884 年在纽约布鲁克林的科尼岛开幕。乘客要爬到平台的顶部，然后乘坐长椅状的列车，从高 600 英尺（183 米）的轨道上滑下来，然后再滑到另一座塔的顶端，列车会在那里切换至返回轨道，乘客们就开始回程。
This track design was soon replaced with an oval complete circuit.	这个轨道设计很快就被替换成椭圆形的完整回圈。
In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first full-circuit coaster with a lift hill, the Gravity Pleasure Road, which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.	1885 年，菲利普·欣克尔推出了首座带爬升坡的全回圈过山车，名为 Gravity Pleasure Road，成为科尼岛最受欢迎的游乐设施。
Not to be outdone, in 1886 Thompson patented his design of roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery.	1886 年，汤普森也不甘落后，他设计的包含绘制风景暗道的过山车获得了专利。
"Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county.	“观光过山车”很快出现在全国各地的游乐场。
By 1919, the first underfriction roller coaster had been developed by John Miller.	1919 年，约翰·米勒设计了首座摩擦不足过山车。
Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world.	很快，全世界的游乐场纷纷建起了过山车。
Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, Cyclone, was opened at Coney Island in 1927.	旋风过山车可能是历史上最出名的过山车，于 1927 年在科尼岛开幕。
The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, and theme parks, in general, went into decline.	大萧条终结了过山车的黄金时代，大部分主题公园开始没落。
This lasted until 1972 when the instant success of The Racer at Kings Island began a roller coaster renaissance which has continued to this day.	这种情况持续到 1972 年，国王岛游乐园的赛车过山车突然获得成功，自此开启了过山车复兴，一直延续至今。
In 1959, Disneyland introduced a design breakthrough with Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first roller coaster to use a tubular steel track.	1959 年，迪士尼乐园推出了有突破性设计的 Matterhorn Bobsleds，这是首座使用管状钢轨的过山车。
Unlike wooden coaster rails, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, allowing designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs.	与木质过山车轨道不同，管状钢轨可以弯成任何角度，设计师就可以更好地在设计中结合圆环、急转以及其他操作。
Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden coasters and hybrids are still being built.	大多数现代过山车都是用钢铁制成，但仍有木质过山车和混合过山车。
There are several explanations of the name roller coaster.	过山车这个名字有多种解释。
It is said to have originated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast.	据说起源于早期美国设计，这种设计的滑坡或斜坡上装有可以让列车滑行的滚轮。
This design was abandoned in favor of fitting the wheels to the sled or other vehicles, but the name endured.	由于轮子被安装到雪橇或其他车辆上，因此这种设计被放弃了，但名字却被保留下来。
Another explanation is that it originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887.	另一种解释是，它起源于 1887 年位于马萨诸塞州黑弗里尔一座轮滑场的游乐设施。
A toboggan-like sled was raised to the top of a track which consisted of hundreds of rollers.	类似于平底雪橇的小车被抬到轨道顶部，轨道包含数百个滚轮。
This Roller Toboggan then took off down gently rolling hills to the floor.	然后，Roller Toboggan 缓慢从山上滑下。
The inventors of this ride, Stephen E. Jackman and Byron B. Floyd, claim that they were the first to use the term "roller coaster".	过山车的发明者史蒂芬·E·杰克曼和拜伦·B·弗洛伊德声称他们是第一个使用“过山车”一词的人。
The term jet coaster is used for roller coasters in Japan, where such amusement park rides are very popular.	在过山车很流行的日本，人们用云霄飞车一词指代过山车。
In many languages, the name refers to "Russian mountains".	许多语言仍使用“俄罗斯山”一词作为名字。
Contrastingly, in Russian, they are called "American mountains".	相反，俄语中称它们为“美国山”。
In the Scandinavian languages and German, the roller coaster is referred as "mountain-and-valley railway".	在北日耳曼语系和德语中，过山车被称为“山峦和山谷铁路”。
German also knows the word "Achterbahn", stemming from "Figur-8-Bahn", like Dutch "Achtbaan", relating to the form of the number 8 ("acht" in German and also Dutch).	德语中也用“Achterbahn”一词，来源于“Figur-8-Bahn”，就像荷兰语的“Achtbaan”，与数字 8 的形状有关（德语和荷兰语的“acht”）。
Several height classifications have been used by parks and manufacturers in marketing their roller coasters, as well as enthusiasts within the industry.	游乐园和制造商在营销过山车时，以及行业内的爱好者使用了几种高度分类。
One classification, the kiddie coaster, is a roller coaster specifically designed for younger riders.	儿童过山车分类是指专门为儿童设计的过山车。
Following World War II, parks began pushing for more of them to be built in contrast to the height and age restrictions of standard designs at the time.	第二次世界大战后，公园不管当时标准设计的高度和年龄限制，开始建造更多过山车。
Companies like Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) developed scaled-down versions of their larger models to accommodate the demand.	Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) 等公司开发了大型版本的缩小版，以满足需求。
These typically featured lift hills smaller than 25 feet (7.6 m), and still do today.	这种特别的爬升坡高度不足 25 英尺（7.6 米），迄今仍是这个高度。
The rise of kiddie coasters soon led to the development of "junior" models that had lift hills up to 45 feet (14 m).	儿童过山车的兴起很快促进了“小型”过山车的发展，这种模式的过山车坡度高达 45 英尺（14 米）。
A notable example of a junior coaster is the Sea Dragon – the oldest operating roller coaster from PTC's legendary designer John Allen – which opened at Wyandot Lake in 1956 near Powell, Ohio.	小型过山车的一个显著的例子是 Sea Dragon 过山车，由 PTC 的传奇设计师约翰·艾伦设计，1956 年在俄亥俄州鲍威尔附近的怀恩湖开放，是现存最古老的过山车。
A hypercoaster, occasionally stylized as hyper coaster, is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least 200 feet (61 m).	大型过山车有时又称“超级过山车”，是一种上升和下降幅度至少为 200 英尺（61 米）的过山车。
Moonsault Scramble, which debuted at Fuji-Q Highland in 1984, was the first to break this barrier, though the term hypercoaster was first coined by Cedar Point and Arrow Dynamics with the opening of Magnum XL-200 in 1989.	Moonsault Scramble 过山车于 1984 年在日本富士急乐园首次开放，是首款打破这一障碍的过山车，尽管“超级过山车”这一名称是衫点乐园和 Arrow point 公司 1989 年在开放 Magnum XL-200 过山车时首创的。
Hypercoasters have become one of the most predominant types of roller coasters in the world, now led by manufacturers Bolliger & Mabillard and Intamin.	超级过山车已经变成世界上最主要的过山车种类之一，而Bolliger&Mabillard 公司以及 Intamin 公司是现在世界上最大的超级过山车制造商。
Salmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes.	三文鱼通常在海拔较高的淡水河产卵。
The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry.	卵孵化成小鲑鱼或鲑鱼苗。
The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes.	鲑鱼苗会迅速长成幼鲑，它们身上有竖条纹，用以伪装自己。
The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off.	幼鲑在自己出生的溪流里待上 6个月到 3 年的时间，就会长成二龄鲑，二龄鲑的一大特点浑身银光闪闪，身上的鳞片很容易被蹭掉。
Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.	所有的三文鱼卵中，只有 10% 的卵能活到这一阶段。
The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water.	二龄鲑体内的化学物质会发生变化，从而得以在海水中生存。
While a few species of salmon remain in fresh water throughout their life cycle, the majority are anadromous and migrate to the ocean for maturation: in these species, smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.	虽然有几种三文鱼一生都生活在淡水中，但绝大多数三文鱼都是在淡水河出生，在海里长大成熟。这种三文鱼在二龄鲑时期会花一部分时间生活在微咸水里，此时它们体内会发生化学反应，帮助它们适应大海里的渗透调节。
The salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature.	三文鱼会在大海里生活 1 到 5 年（具体视种类而定），然后就会达到性成熟。
The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn.	然后，成年的三文鱼就会回去产卵，主要是回到它们出生的溪流。
Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea.	大西洋鲑会在大海中生活 1 到 4 年。
When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. Grilse may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.	只在海中养育了一年就打道回府的三文鱼，在加拿大、英国和爱尔兰被称为早熟鲑。早熟鲑会在产卵时现身，它们在大的雄性鲑不注意的情况下，把自己的精子释放在卵子上。
Prior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon undergo changes.	在产卵之前，三文鱼会发生一些变化，具体视其所属种类而定。
They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon).	它们可能会长出一个驼峰，一颗犬齿，或一个钩吻（雄鲑下颚处的明显弧状）。
All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour.	所有的鲑鱼，都会由刚从海里游到河川时的银灰蓝，变成更深的颜色。
Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce.	三文鱼是伟大的旅行家，为了繁衍后代，有时不惜逆着强流和急流回溯几百公里。
Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over 1,400 km (900 mi) and climb nearly 2,100 m (7,000 ft) from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn.	例如，爱达荷中部的王鲑和红鲑会从太平洋游 1400 公里（900 英里），再向上游 2100 米（7000 英尺），回到原来的地方去产卵。
Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts.	随着在淡水中待的时间变长，鲑鱼的状况开始走下坡路，产卵后还会进一步恶化。这时的鲑鱼被称为产卵鲑。
In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity.	成年鲑产卵后几天或几周后就会死去，所有种类的太平洋鲑都是这样，这样的特性被称为一次生殖。
Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females.	有 2% 到 4% 的大西洋鲑能够存活下来进行再次繁殖，这种鲑全部是雌性。
However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%).	然而，即便能够存活下来进行多次繁殖（反复生殖），这些种类的鲑产卵后死亡率也是非常高的（可能高达 40% 至 50%）。
To lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd.	为了产卵，雌鲑会用尾巴（尾鳍）弄出一个低压区。它们会把砂砾挖松，让河水冲到下游，挖出一个浅洼地，叫做产卵床。
The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering 2.8 m² (30 sq ft).	产卵床有时面积可达 2.8 平方米（30 平方英尺），可容纳 5000 个卵。
The eggs usually range from orange to red.	卵的颜色通常为橘色到红色不等。
One or more males approach the female in her redd, depositing sperm, or milt, over the roe.	一条或一条以上的雄鲑会来到产卵床的雌鲑跟前，把精子或精液释放在卵子上面。
The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd.	接下来，雌鲑会在凹洼上游的一端搅动砂砾，让砂砾把卵埋起来，然后再继续前进做下一个产卵床。
The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.	在所有的卵全部排完之前，雌鲑会一直造产卵床，可能会有多达七个。
Each year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter.	一年中，鱼类会经历一个快速生长期，通常是在夏季；一个缓慢生长期，一般是在冬季。
This results in ring formation around an earbone called the otolith (annuli), analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk.	这就导致鱼类耳骨周围形成轮纹，称为耳石（轮），类似于树干上肉眼可见的生长年轮。
Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.	淡水生长表现为排列密集的轮，海水生长表现为间隔较宽的轮。产卵时的特征则是轮纹出现明显的腐蚀，因为鱼的体质量转化成了鱼精和鱼卵。
Freshwater streams and estuaries provide important habitat for many salmon species.	淡水溪流和河口为许多种类的三文鱼提供了重要的栖息地。
They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older.	它们年幼时以陆生和水生昆虫、片脚类生物以及其它甲壳类动物为食，长大后则主要以其它鱼类为食。
Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel, and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) to the developing embryos.	卵被产在较深、砂砾较大的水域，发育中的胚胎需要凉爽的水温和流动性好的水流（以保证供氧）。
Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow.	鲑鱼在生命早期死亡率通常很高，原因一个是自然捕食，一个是人为因素导致栖息地发生变化，如淤积、水温升高、含氧量降低、河流覆盖面积减少以及河流流量变少等。
Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean.	河口以及河口湿地，为出发前往大海之前的鲑鱼提供了重要的育幼场所。
Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.	湿地不仅有助于缓存河口沉积物和污染物，而且是一处重要的觅食和藏身之所。
Salmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration (phenoptosis, or "programmed aging") at the end of their lives.	没有在其它方式下丧命的鲑鱼，则会在生命的最后阶段出现急速衰老（机体衰老，或“”程序性衰老）。
Their bodies rapidly deteriorate right after they spawn as a result of the release of massive amounts of corticosteroids.	一旦产卵完毕，它们的身体状况便会迅速衰弱下去，这是由于释放了大量皮质类固醇的缘故。
In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species, supporting wildlife such as birds, bears and otters.	在太平洋西北部以及阿拉斯加，鲑鱼是支撑鸟类、熊、水濑等野生动物的生存的关键物种。
The bodies of salmon represent a transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, to the forest ecosystem.	鲑鱼以自己的身体，将富含氮、硫、碳、磷的海洋营养物质从海洋转移到森林生态系统。
Grizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent wooded areas.	灰熊扮演着生态系统工程师的角色，它们捕捉鲑鱼，并把鲑鱼带到附近的林地里。
There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses.	它们在那里留下了营养丰富的尿液和粪便，以及吃剩的鲑鱼尸体。
Bears are estimated to leave up to half the salmon they harvest on the forest floor, in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms per hectare, providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands.	据估计，熊捕捉的鲑鱼会有一半吃不完而留在林地上，密度可达每公顷 4000 公斤，为河岸林地带来的氮占该地氮总量的 24%。
The foliage of spruce trees up to 500 m (1,600 ft) from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.	在有灰熊捉鱼为食的河流，高达 500 米（1600 英尺）的云杉的叶子被发现含有氮，这里的氮就是来自被捕的鲑鱼。
It has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys, loss of the lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way.	人们发现，在溯河性七鳃鳗数量已经减少甚至消失的河流，七鳃鳗的减少也对鲑鱼产生了负面的影响。
Like salmon, anadromous lampreys stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream.	溯河性七鳃鳗和鲑鱼一样，产卵后会停止进食并死去，它们的尸体腐烂后会向河里释放出各种营养物质。
Also, along with species like rainbow trout and Sacramento sucker, lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning.	此外，和虹鳟以及塞城亚口鱼等鱼种一样，七鳃鳗产卵时会清理河里的砂砾。
Their larvae, called ammocoetes, are filter feeders which contribute to the health of the waters.	它们的仔鱼被称为幼七鳃鳗，是滤食动物，有助于保持水质健康。
They are also a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed predators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on smolts.	它们也是小鲑鱼的食物来源，而且，由于幼七鳃鳗更肥，含油量更高，因此可以假定那些捕食者可能更喜欢幼七鳃鳗而非小鲑鱼，这一定程度上减轻了小鲑鱼被捕的压力。
Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and sea lions, which can eat 30 lampreys to every salmon, allowing more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine mammals.	成年七鳃鳗也是海豹和海狮的首选，它们每吃 30 条七鳃鳗才会吃一条鲑鱼，这就使得更多的成年鲑能够避免被海洋动物捕食，得以进入河流产卵。
According to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxozoan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids.	根据加拿大生物学家多萝西·基瑟的说法，鲑鱼鱼肉中通常存在“鲑居尾孢虫”这种粘原虫寄生虫。
It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Haida Gwaii Islands.	在对返回海达瓜依群岛的鲑鱼进行野外取样时，就出现过这方面的记录。
The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid.	鱼的反应是形成许多含有乳白色汁液的囊肿，将寄生感染隔离在这些囊肿中。
This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.	这种汁液中积累了大量的寄生虫。
Henneguya and other parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon is one of two hosts.	尾孢虫以及其它粘原虫种属的寄生虫有着复杂的生命周期，在其生命周期之内，它们会寄宿两大宿主身上，其中一个是鲑鱼。
The fish releases the spores after spawning.	鱼产卵后会释放出寄生虫孢子。
In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream.	以尾孢虫为例，尾孢虫孢子会进入第二宿主体内，而第二宿主极有可能是产卵河溪中的无脊椎动物。
When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon.	当幼鲑迁徙回海洋时，第二宿主会释放出孢子，使幼鲑被感染。
The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle.	然后寄生虫寄居在鲑鱼体内，直到下一次产卵，如此循环。
The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle.	会让鳟鱼得眩晕病的粘原虫寄生虫也有着类似的生命周期。
However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon—even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.	然而，与得晕眩病的情况相反，感染了尾孢虫的宿主鲑鱼似乎并不会因此得病——即便是被重度感染的鲑鱼，最终也能成功返回出生地产卵。
According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states, "the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections.	根据凯泽博士的说法，20 世纪 80 年代中期，纳奈莫太平洋生物站的科学家对鲑居尾孢虫进行了大量的研究，特别是在一份概述报告中，他们这样指出：“幼年时在淡水中待的时间越长的鲑鱼，感染就越明显。”
Hence in order of prevalence, coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink.	因此，按感染率排序，银鲑是受感染最严重的，其次是红鲑、王鲑、狗鲑、粉鲑。
As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., "are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection." The report also states, "It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health.	此外，该报告还指出，在进行该研究的那个时期，来自不列颠哥伦比亚省内的大型河流系统（如弗雷则河、斯基纳河、纳斯河）的中上游以及该省南部内陆及沿海河流的鲑鱼“感染率更有可能保持在低水平”。该报告还表示，“应该强调的是，鲑居尾孢虫虽然对水产经济有害，但从公共健康的角度来看是无害的。
It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man".	它们是专门针对鱼类的寄生虫，无法寄生在温血动物体内或影响温血动物，包括人类。”
According to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, "Henneguya salminicola is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon.	加拿大食品检验局软体贝类项目专家克劳斯·沙利表示，“不列颠哥伦比亚南部也发现了鲑居尾孢虫，所有的鲑鱼种类都受到了感染。
I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation."	我之前就检验过到处布满囊肿的烟熏狗鲑鱼块，而且，巴克利湾（不列颠哥伦比亚省南部，温哥华岛西岸）里的一些红鲑也因其高感染发生率而出名。“
Sea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon.	海虱，尤其是鲑疮痂鱼虱以及各种鱼虱属，包括 C.clemensi 和 C.rogercresseyi，会对野生鲑鱼和养殖鲑鱼造成致命的感染。
Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days.	海虱是一种体表寄生虫，会在浮游无节幼体期以及桡足幼体期期间依附到野生鲑鱼体表，以鱼体分泌的粘液、血液和皮肤为食，为期数日。
Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms	大量密集养殖的开放式鲑鱼养殖场
can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result.	可能造成海虱泛滥，许多野生小鲑鱼在通过布置有大量开放式养殖场的河口时被海虱感染，因而没能存活下来。
Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable.	成年鲑感染海虱的数量只要不超过临界值就有可能存活下来，但幼鲑年幼皮薄，在迁徙至大海的过程中极其容易夭折。
On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.	在加拿大太平洋沿岸的一些海域，感染鱼虱致死的粉红鲑数量通常超过 80%。
The risk of injury caused by underwater pile driving has been studied by Dr. Halvorsen and her co-workers.	哈尔沃森博士及其同事对水下打桩可能带来的危害进行了研究。
The study concluded that the fish are at risk of injury if the cumulative sound exposure level exceeds 210 dB relative to 1 μPa² s.	该研究的结论是，如果累计的表征声压级相对于1 帕斯卡超过 210 分贝，就可能会对鱼类造成伤害。
As can be seen from the production chart at the left, the global capture reported by different countries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon has remained fairly steady since 1990 at about one million tonnes per year.	从左边的产量图可以看出，不同国家向粮农组织所报告的野生三文鱼的全球商业捕捞量自 1990 年以来一直保持在每年约 100 万吨的稳定水平。
This is in contrast to farmed salmon (below) which has increased in the same period from about 0.6 million tonnes to well over two million tonnes.	这与养殖鲑（见下图）的情况形成了鲜明对比，后者同一时期从 60 万吨左右一路飙升至 200 吨以上。
Nearly all captured wild salmon are Pacific salmon.	几乎所有野外捕捞的鲑鱼都是太平洋鲑。
The capture of wild Atlantic salmon has always been relatively small, and has declined steadily since 1990.	野外捕捞的大西洋鲑数量一直相对较少，并且自 1990 年以来逐年下降。
In 2011 only 2,500 tonnes were reported.	2011 年上报的数量只有 2500 吨。
In contrast about half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.	相比之下，所有的养殖鲑中，大约有一半是大西洋鲑。
Recreational salmon fishing can be a technically demanding kind of sport fishing, not necessarily congenial for beginning fishermen.	娱乐性三文鱼垂钓可能技术要求较高，这样的钓鱼运动对刚入门的垂钓者可能不太适合。
A conflict exists between commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for the right to salmon stock resources.	商业性捕捞者和娱乐性垂钓者之间存在冲突，大家都想争夺三文鱼资源的占有权。
Commercial fishing in estuaries and coastal areas is often restricted so enough salmon can return to their natal rivers where they can spawn and be available for sport fishing.	河口和沿海地区通常禁止商业捕捞，因此有足够的三文鱼得以回到自己出生的河流，它们在那里产卵的同时，也为垂钓运动带来了垂钓对象。
On parts of the North American west coast sport salmon fishing completely replaces inshore commercial fishing.	在北美西海岸部分地区，三文鱼垂钓运动完全取代了近海商业捕捞。
In most cases, the commercial value of a salmon can be several times less than the value attributed to the same fish caught by a sport fisherman.	大多数情况下，一条三文鱼的商业价值要比垂钓这条鱼所带来的娱乐价值要低好几倍。
This is "a powerful economic argument for allocating stock resources preferentially to sport fishing."	这是“将鱼资源优先分配给娱乐性垂钓在经济上的一个强有力论据”。
Salmon aquaculture is a major contributor to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10 billion annually.	三文鱼养殖占全世界有鳍鱼养殖总产量很大一部分，每年产值约 100 亿美元。
Other commonly cultured fish species include tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream.	其它常见的养殖鱼种类还有罗非鱼、鲶鱼、海鲈、鲤鱼和鲷鱼等。
Salmon farming is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe.	智利、挪威、苏格兰、加拿大以及法罗群岛的三文鱼养殖业非常发达，欧美两地所消费的三文鱼大多数来源于这些地区。
Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and Tasmania, Australia.	大西洋三文鱼在俄罗斯、塔斯马尼亚、澳洲也有养殖，但产量非常小。
Salmon are carnivorous.	三文鱼是肉食性动物。
They are fed a meal produced from catching other wild fish and other marine organisms.	要捕捉其它野生鱼类和其它海洋生物作来为饲料喂养它们。
Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish.	三文鱼养殖对野生饵料鱼的需求量很大。
Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product.	三文鱼需要摄入大量的蛋白质营养，而且养殖的三文鱼出栏时的成品量还比不上三文鱼所吃掉的饵料鱼的量。
On a dry weight basis, 2–4 kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produce one kg of salmon.	就干重来说，每产出一公斤三文鱼，就需要消耗 2 至 4 公斤的野生鱼。
As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.	随着三文鱼养殖产业规模扩大，人们需要更多的野生饵料鱼作为饲料，而目前， 全世界受监测的渔场中， 75% 的渔场已经接近甚至超过了自己的最大持续渔获量。
The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.	为了供应三文鱼养殖而对野生饵料鱼进行工业化规模的提取，这样的做法影响了以该饵料鱼为食的野生鱼类的生存。
Work continues on substituting vegetable proteins for animal proteins in the salmon diet.	人们仍在研究如何在三文鱼的饮食中加入植物蛋白以替代动物蛋白。
This substitution results in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 fatty acid content in the farmed product.	这样的替换会导致颇受市场青睐的欧米伽-3 脂肪酸在养殖鲑中的含量降低。
Intensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs.	集约化三文鱼养殖场使用开放式网箱，生产成本很低。
Persea americana is a tree that grows to 20 m (66 ft), with alternately arranged leaves 12–25 cm (4.7–9.8 in) long.	鳄梨是一种可以长到 20 米（66 英尺）的树，叶子交替排列，长 12 至 25 厘米（4.7 至 9.8 英寸）。
Panicles of flowers with deciduous bracts arise from new growth or the axils of leaves.	长出新的叶子时或者叶腋处会形成圆锥花序，苞片具有落叶性。
The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) wide.	花不显眼，呈黄绿色，宽 5 至 10 毫米（0.2 至 0.4 英寸）。
The species is variable because of selection pressure by humans to produce larger, fleshier fruits with a thinner exocarp.	这种植物物种会在人类选择的压力下发生变化，因为人总是喜欢个头更大、皮更薄肉更多的果实。
The avocado fruit is a climacteric, single-seeded berry, due to the imperceptible endocarp covering the seed, rather than a drupe.	鳄梨果是一种呼吸跃变型水果，只有一颗种子，由于隐蔽的内果皮裹住了种子，因此，鳄梨是一种浆果而非核果。
The pear-shaped fruit is 7–20 cm (2.8–7.9 in) long, weighs between 100 and 1,000 g (3.5 and 35.3 oz), and has a large central seed, 5–6.4 cm (2.0–2.5 in) long.	这种梨状的果实长 7 至 20 厘米（2.8 至 7.9 英寸），重 100 至 1000 克（3.5 至 35.3 盎司），中间有一枚大种子，种子长 5 至 6.4 厘米（2.0至 2.5 英寸）。
Persea americana, or the avocado, possibly originated in the Tehuacan Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico, although fossil evidence suggests similar species were much more widespread millions of years ago.	鳄梨又叫牛油果，可能起源于墨西哥普埃布拉州的特瓦坎山谷，但有化石证据表明，数百万年前类似物种的分布要比这广泛得多。
However, there is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the avocado, resulting in the currently recognized Mexican (aoacatl), Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), and West Indian (tlacacolaocatl) landraces.	然而，有证据表明，鳄梨一开始可能分属于三种不同的培育品种，后来演化成了目前公认的墨西哥鳄梨（aoacatl）、危地马拉鳄梨（quiaoacatl）以及西印度群岛鳄梨（tlacacolaocatl）。
The Mexican and Guatemalan landraces originated in the highlands of those countries, while the West Indian landrace is a lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range through human agency before the arrival of the Europeans.	墨西哥和危地马拉品种源自于这两个国家的高地，而西印度群岛品种则是一种低地品种，分布在危地马拉、哥斯达黎加、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔和秘鲁等地，在欧洲人到来之前，该品种曾在人为的作用下得到了广泛分布。
The three separate landraces were most likely to have already intermingled in pre-Columbian America and were described in the Florentine Codex.	这三种相互独立的地方品种很有可能在哥伦布发现美洲之前已经混种，这一点在佛罗伦萨法典中有相关描述。
The earliest residents were living in temporary camps in an ancient wetland eating avocados, chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds, and sea lions.	古代最早的居民生活在湿地的临时营地里，以鳄梨、辣椒、软体动物、鲨鱼、鸟类和海狮为食。
The oldest discovery of an avocado pit comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to 10,000 years ago.	最古老的鳄梨核发现于考克斯卡特兰洞，可追溯到 9000 到 10000 年前。
Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley from around the same time period also show early evidence for the presence of avocado.	差不多同时期，在特瓦坎河谷的其他洞穴也发现了证据，证明鳄梨很早以前就已存在。
There is evidence for avocado use at Norte Chico civilization sites in Peru by at least 3,200 years ago and at Caballo Muerto in Peru from around 3,800 to 4,500 years ago.	秘鲁小北文化遗址的发现证明至少 3200 年前人类就已经食用鳄梨，而秘鲁 Caballo Muerto 的发现可以追溯到 3800 年至 4500 年以前。
The native, undomesticated variety is known as a criollo, and is small, with dark black skin, and contains a large seed.	本地未被驯化的品种叫 criollo，个小，果皮很黑，内含一枚大种子。
It probably coevolved with extinct megafauna.	该品种可能与已经灭绝的巨型动物是相互进化的关系。
The avocado tree also has a long history of cultivation in Central and South America, likely beginning as early as 5,000 BC.	鳄梨树在中美洲和南美洲也有很长的栽培历史，可能早在公元前 5000 年就已经开始有人种植。
A water jar shaped like an avocado, dating to AD 900, was discovered in the pre-Incan city of Chan Chan.	在前印加时代的昌昌古城发现了一个形似鳄梨的水罐，其历史可追溯到公元 900 年。
The earliest known written account of the avocado in Europe is that of Martín Fernández de Enciso (circa 1470–1528) in 1519 in his book, Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo.	在欧洲，已知关于鳄梨的最早书面记载出现在 Martín Fernández de Enciso (约 1470–1528)  于1519 年所写的《 Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo》一书中。
The first detailed account that unequivocally describes the avocado was given by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in his work Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias in 1526.	1526 年，Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés 在其著作《印度自然历史概论》中首次明确地对鳄梨进行了详尽的描述。
The first written record in English of the use of the word 'avocado' was by Hans Sloane, who coined the term, in a 1696 index of Jamaican plants.	英语中关于“鳄梨”一词的首次书面使用的记录是由汉斯·斯隆作出的，1696 年他为牙买加的植物编索引时创造了这个词。
The plant was introduced to Spain in 1601, Indonesia around 1750, Mauritius in 1780, Brazil in 1809, the United States mainland in 1825, South Africa and Australia in the late 19th century, and Israel in 1908.	这种植物于 1601 年被引入西班牙，1750 年左右被引入印度尼西亚，1780 年被引入毛里求斯，1809 年被引入巴西，1825 年被引入美国本土，19 世纪末被引入南非和澳大利亚，1908 年被引入以色列。
In the United States, the avocado was introduced to Florida and Hawaii in 1833 and in California in 1856.	在美国，鳄梨于 1833 年被引入佛罗里达和夏威夷，1856年被引入加利福尼亚。
Before 1915, the avocado was commonly referred to in California as ahuacate and in Florida as alligator pear.	1915 年以前，鳄梨在加利福尼亚被称为“ahuacate”，在佛罗里达则被称为“alligator pear（短吻鳄梨）”。
In 1915, the California Avocado Association introduced the then-innovative term avocado to refer to the plant.	1915 年，加利福尼亚鳄梨委员会用当时颇具创新意味的一个术语“鳄梨”来指代这种植物。
The word "avocado" comes from the Spanish aguacate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ], which goes back to the proto-Aztecan *pa:wa which also meant "avocado".	 "鳄梨" 这个词来源于西班牙语中的 aguacate，而 aguacate 又来源于那瓦特语中的 āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ]，而 ahuacatl 又要追溯到原始阿兹特克语中的 *pa:wa，同样也是“鳄梨”的意思。
Sometimes the Nahuatl word was used with the meaning "testicle", probably because of the likeness between the fruit and the body part.	有时候这个那瓦特语单词又会用来指代“睾丸”，也许是因为鳄梨和这一身体部位之间存在着相似之处。
The modern English name comes from an English rendering of the Spanish aguacate as avogato.	鳄梨现在的英文名称源自于西班牙语单词"aguacate"的英译版本"avogato"。
The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as "avogato pear", a term which was later corrupted as "alligator pear".	经证实，关于鳄梨，英语中已知的最早书面表达是 1697 年的“avogato pear”，后来用着用着就变成了“alligator pear”。
Because the word avogato sounded like "advocate", several languages reinterpreted it to have that meaning.	因为“avogato”这个词听起来像"avocate（律师）"，因此，好几种语言都对这个词重新进行了解释，给它加上这一层意思。
French uses avocat, which also means lawyer, and "advocate" — forms of the word appear in several Germanic languages, such as the (now obsolete) German Advogato-Birne, the old Danish advokat-pære (today it is called avocado) and the Dutch advocaatpeer.	法语中用的是“avocat”，也是律师的意思，而对于 "advocate" ，好几种日耳曼语言中出现了这个词的形态，如德语中“Advogato-Birne（现已过时）”， 古丹麦语中的“advokat-pære ”（现在叫“ avocado”）”以及荷兰语中的“advocaatpeer”。
In other Central American and Caribbean Spanish-speaking countries, it is known by the Mexican name, while South American Spanish-speaking countries use a Quechua-derived word, palta.	在其他中美洲以及加勒比的西班牙语国家中，鳄梨以某个墨西哥名称为大家所熟知，而在南美的西班牙语国家中，人们用的是克丘亚语中衍生出来的一个词：palta。
In Portuguese, it is abacate.	葡萄牙语中用的是“abacate”。
The fruit is sometimes called an avocado pear or alligator pear (due to its shape and the rough green skin of some cultivars).	这种水果有时叫“油梨”或“鳄鱼梨”（因某些品种的外形及绿色粗糙的果皮形似鳄鱼）
The Nahuatl āhuacatl can be compounded with other words, as in ahuacamolli, meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word guacamole derives.	那瓦特语中的“āhuacatl”还可以与其它词复合起来用，如“ahuacamolli”, 意为鳄梨汤或鳄梨酱 ，西班牙语单词“guacamole”就是从这个词衍生出来的。
In the United Kingdom, the term avocado pear is still sometimes misused as applied when avocados first became commonly available in the 1960s.	在英国，“鳄梨”有时仍然会被误用，以为这个词是用在 20 世纪 60 年代鳄梨刚开始兴起那会。
Originating as a diminutive in Australian English, a clipped form, avo, has since become a common colloquialism in South Africa and the United Kingdom.	“avo”这个缩略词最初是澳洲英语中的一个指小词，现在已经变成南非人和英国人口语中经常用到的一个词。
It is known as "butter fruit" in parts of India.	在印度部分地区，鳄梨又称为黄油果。
The subtropical species needs a climate without frost and with little wind.	这种亚热带品种要在无霜风小的气候中生长。
High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination.	风太大会降低湿度，使花朵缺水，从而影响授粉。
When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur, although the 'Hass' cultivar can tolerate temperatures down to −1 °C.	即便霜冻不严重，也可能会出现果实未熟就提前脱落的现象，尽管“哈斯”品种可以忍受低至 -1°c 的温度。
Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of Gainesville, Florida, which survive temperatures as low as −6.5 °C (20 °F) with only minor leaf damage.	有几种耐寒品种被种植在弗罗里达州盖恩斯维尔市这一带，这些品种可以在低至 -6.5°c（20 华氏度）的温度下生存，只表现出轻微的叶片损伤。
The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep.	这种树还需要透气性良好的土壤，土壤深度最好超过 1 米。
According to information published by the Water Footprint Network, it takes an average of approximately 70 litres (18 US gal) of applied fresh ground or surface water, not including rainfall or natural moisture in the soil, to grow one avocado.	根据水足迹网络公开的资料，种植一株鳄梨树平均需要约 70 升（18 加仑）的地表淡水或地下淡水进行灌溉，其中不包括降雨量和土壤中的自然水分。
However, the amount of water needed depends on where it is grown; for example, in the main avocado-growing region of Chile, about 320 litres (85 US gal) of applied water are needed to grow one avocado.	不过，需要多少用水量还得看树种在什么地方。比如，在智利主要的鳄梨种植区，种植一株鳄梨大约需要灌溉 320 升（85 加仑）的水。
Yield is reduced when the irrigation water is highly saline.	如果灌溉水含盐量很高，就会导致植株减产。
These soil and climate conditions are available in southern and eastern Colombia, Morocco, the Levant, South Africa, Venezuela, Spain, Peru, parts of central and northern Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of southern India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, southern California, Arizona, Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, Hawaii, Ecuador, and Rwanda.	具备这些土壤条件和气候条件的地区有：哥伦比亚南部和东部、摩洛哥、黎凡特、南非、委内瑞拉、西班牙、秘鲁、智利中部和北部的部分地区、越南、印度尼西亚、印度南部部分地区、斯里兰卡、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾群岛、马来西亚、中美洲、加勒比、墨西哥、南加州、亚利桑那、波多黎各、德克萨斯州、佛罗里达州、夏威夷、厄瓜多尔、卢旺达。
Each region has different cultivars.	每个地区的品种都各不相同。
Commercial orchards produce an average of seven tonnes per hectare each year, with some orchards achieving 20 tonnes per hectare.	商业性鳄梨种植园平均每年每公顷产出 7 吨，一些果园能达到每公顷 20 吨。
Biennial bearing can be a problem, with heavy crops in one year being followed by poor yields the next.	每两年结一次果会导致一个问题：头一年收成很好，第二年收成很差。
Like the banana, the avocado is a climacteric fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree.	鳄梨和香蕉一样，是一种呼吸跃变型果实，这种果实虽然在树上长成，但摘下来才会变熟。
Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at 3.3 to 5.6 °C (37.9 to 42.1 °F) until they reach their final destination.	商业用途的鳄梨会在果实还很硬很绿的时候就摘下来，在运送到目的地之前会一直保存在 3.3°C 至 5.6°C（37.9 华氏度至 42.1 华氏度） 的冷却箱中。
Avocados must be mature to ripen properly.	鳄梨必须发育好才会熟得好。
Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground.	从树上掉下来的鳄梨，会在地上变熟。
Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick 'Hass' avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards.	通常情况下，鳄梨一旦长成就会被摘下来。但墨西哥的“哈斯”鳄梨果农会在果实中的干物质超过 23% 时进行采摘，而其他鳄梨生产国也有着类似的标准。
Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at room temperature (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of ethylene gas).	摘下来的鳄梨在室温条件下放置 1 至 2 周（视品种而定）就会变熟（如果和苹果、香蕉等其他水果放在一起，由于乙烯气体的作用，会更快变熟）。
Some supermarkets sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening.	一些超市出售的熟鳄梨就是用人工合成的乙烯催熟的。
The use of an ethylene gas "ripening room", which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of Escondido, California, in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them "back in the bin," and moving on without making a purchase.	使用乙烯气体“熟成室”催熟水果如今已是行业标准，这种做法是 20 世纪 80 年代加利福尼亚埃斯孔迪多市的农民吉尔·亨利首创的，当时，一家超市的隐式监控拍下了一个镜头，从镜头里可以看见，人们在买不熟的鳄梨时会用力地捏来捏去，然后“放回箱子”里，什么都不买就走掉。针对这一现象，吉尔·亨利发明了这种催熟法。
In some cases, avocados can be left on the tree for several months, which is an advantage to commercial growers who seek the greatest return for their crop, but if the fruit remains unpicked for too long, it falls to the ground.	某些情况下，鳄梨可以留在树上好几个月不摘，这对于追求最大种植回报的商业种植者来说是一大利好。但如果太长时间不摘，果实就会自己掉到地上。
Avocados can be propagated by seed, taking roughly four to six years to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing.	鳄梨可以用种子繁殖，大约 4 到 6 年就会结果。但在某些情况下，幼苗需要 10 年的时间才能结出果实。
The offspring is unlikely to be identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality.	在果实的品质方面，后代植株与母体植株是不可能一模一样的。
Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (clonal rootstocks).	因此，优良品种是通过嫁接到砧木上来进行繁殖的，而这些砧木可以通过种子繁殖（实生砧）或压条繁殖（无性系砧）的方式来进行培植。
After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted.	在温室里生长大概一年时间后，砧木幼株就可以接受嫁接了。
Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used.	常见的嫁接手法有顶接和侧接。
The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold.	接穗还要再生长 6 至 12 个月，该植株才能上市出售。
Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.	选择无性系砧木是因为需要对某种特定的土壤状况或病理状况有一定的耐受力，比如土壤通气性差、对疫霉菌引起的土传病（烂根病）有抗病性等。
Commercial avocado production is limited to a small fraction of the vast genetic diversity in the species.	鳄梨家族的品种非常丰富，目前商业化种植的品种仅限于很小的一部分。
Conservation of this genetic diversity has relied largely on field collection, as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks.	保护鳄梨的品种多样性主要依赖现场数据采集，因为鳄梨种子通常无法保存在种子库中。
This is problematic, as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive, and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars.	这会导致各种问题，因为对现存品种进行实地保存成本很高，而栖息地的减少又威胁着野生鳄梨品种的生存。
More recently, an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees.	最近，一种新的保存方法被发明了出来，该方法基于对鳄梨的体细胞胚进行超低温储存，通过一些可靠的方式，在活立木内实现体胚发生和体胚重组。
Avocado trees are vulnerable to bacterial, viral, fungal, and nutritional diseases (excesses and deficiencies of key minerals).	鳄梨树易受细菌、病毒、真菌、营养性疾病（关键矿物质过剩或缺乏）的侵害。
Disease can affect all parts of the plant, causing spotting, rotting, cankers, pitting, and discoloration.	疾病会影响到植株的所有部位，导致植物出现病斑、腐烂、溃疡、点蚀和变色。
Mexico is by far the world's largest avocado growing country, producing several times more than the second largest producer.	墨西哥是目前世界上最大的鳄梨生产国，其产量是第二大鳄梨产国的好几倍。
In 2013, the total area dedicated to avocado production was 188,723 hectares (415,520 acres), and the harvest was 2.03 million tonnes in 2017.	2013 年，鳄梨种植面积总共为 188,723 公顷（415,520 英亩）；2017年，鳄梨的产量为 203 万吨。
The states that produce the most are México, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, and Michoacan, accounting for 86% of the total.	产量最高的州是墨西哥州、莫雷洛斯州、纳亚里特州、普埃布拉州以及米却肯州，占墨西哥总产量的 86%。
In Michoacán, the cultivation is complicated by the existence of drug cartels that extort protection fees from cultivators.	在米却肯州，鳄梨种植因贩毒集团的存在而变得复杂，因为贩毒集团会向种植者勒索保护费。
They are reported to exact 2000 Mexican pesos per hectare from avocado farmers and 1 to 3 pesos/kg of harvested fruit.	据报道，鳄梨果农每种植 1 公顷就要上缴 2000 墨西哥比索，每收获一公斤鳄梨就要上缴1 至 3 比索。
The avocado was introduced from Mexico to California in the 19th century, and has become a successful cash crop.	鳄梨于 19 世纪从墨西哥传入加利福尼亚州，从此成功变身为一颗“致富果”。
About 59,000 acres (240 km²) – some 95% of United States avocado production – is located in Southern California, with 60% in San Diego County.	南加州的鳄梨种植面积约 59000 公顷（240 平方公里）——占比全美总产量的95%——其中 60% 位于圣迭戈县。
Fallbrook, California claims, without official recognition, the title of "Avocado Capital of the World" (also claimed by the town of Uruapan in Mexico), and both Fallbrook and Carpinteria, California, host annual avocado festivals.	加利福尼亚州的福尔布鲁克有一个未经官方认证的称号，叫“世界鳄梨之都”（墨西哥乌鲁阿潘镇也有此称号）。加州的福尔布鲁克以及卡平特里亚每年都会举办鳄梨节。
Avocado is the official fruit of the State of California.	鳄梨是加利福尼亚州的州果。
Hass avocado production in Peru encompasses thousands of hectares in central and western Peru.	秘鲁中部和西部的哈斯鳄梨种植面积达数千公顷。
Peru has now become the largest supplier of avocados imported to the European Union and the second largest supplier to Asia and the United States.	秘鲁现在已经成为欧盟的最大鳄梨供应国、亚洲和美国的第二大鳄梨供应国。
Peru's location near the equator and along the Pacific Ocean creates consistently mild temperatures year round.	秘鲁位于赤道附近，濒临太平洋，全年气温温和。
The soil is rich and sandy and the towering Andes mountains provide a constant flow of pure water for irrigation.	这里的土壤肥沃多沙，高耸的阿尔卑斯山为该地的灌溉提供了源源不断的纯净水源。
Naturally sheltered as it is from heavy rain or freezing temperatures, Peru is an almost perfect climate for the cultivation of avocados.	秘鲁雨不大，气温也不高，气候条件非常适合种植鳄梨，是鳄梨的天然港湾。
Hass avocados from Peru are seasonally available to consumers from May through September and are promoted under the auspices of the Peruvian Avocado Commission, headquartered in Washington, D.C.	秘鲁的哈斯鳄梨是季节性供应的，会在每年的 5 月至 9 月在总部位于华盛顿特区的秘鲁鳄梨委员会的支持下推广上市。
Other avocado cultivars include 'Spinks'.	其他鳄梨品种还包括“斯宾克斯”。
Historically attested varieties (which may or may not survive among horticulturists) include the 'Challenge', 'Dickinson', 'Kist', 'Queen', 'Rey', 'Royal', 'Sharpless', and 'Taft'.	历史上被证实过的（经园艺家之手得以存活下来或未能存活的）鳄梨品种包括：“挑战”鳄梨、“迪金森”鳄梨、“吉斯特”鳄梨、“女王”鳄梨、“雷伊”鳄梨、“皇家”鳄梨、“夏普勒斯”鳄梨、“塔夫脱”鳄梨。
A stoneless avocado, marketed as a "cocktail avocado," which does not contain a pit, is available on a limited basis.	有一种无核鳄梨，市面上叫“鸡尾酒鳄梨”，这种鳄梨没有果核，目前市场供应量不大。
They are five to eight centimetres long; the whole fruit may be eaten, including the skin.	果长 5cm 至 8cm，整个水果都可以吃，包括果皮。
It is produced from an unpollinated blossom in which the seed does not develop.	这种鳄梨是未授粉的花朵结出的果，因此种子没有得到发育。
Seedless avocados regularly appear on trees.	鳄梨树上经常结出无核的鳄梨。
Known in the avocado industry as "cukes", they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.	这种果实在鳄梨界被称为“黄瓜果”，在商业中由于个头太小通常被遗弃。
After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect in 1994, Mexico tried exporting avocados to the US.	1994 年《北美自由贸易协定》生效后，墨西哥开始尝试将鳄梨出口到美国。
The US government resisted, claiming the trade would introduce Tephritidae fruit flies that would destroy California's crops.	美国政府不同意，声称这种交易会将实蝇科果蝇带进来，对加州的农作物造成威胁。
The Mexican government responded by inviting USDA inspectors to Mexico, but the US government declined, claiming fruit fly inspection was not feasible.	墨西哥政府对此的回应是邀请美国农业部检测员前往墨西哥检测，但美国政府拒绝了，理由是果蝇检测行不通。
The Mexican government then proposed to sell avocados only to the northeastern US in the winter (fruit flies cannot withstand extreme cold).	墨西哥政府于是提议只在冬季将鳄梨销往美国东北部（果蝇在极寒条件下无法生存）。
The US government balked, but gave in when the Mexican government started erecting barriers to US corn.	美国政府还想拒绝，但当墨西哥政府开始设立壁垒抵制美国玉米时，美方让步了。
Imports from Mexico in the 2005–2006 season exceeded 130,000 metric tons (143,300 short tons; 127,900 long tons).	2005 年至 2006 年应季期间，从墨西哥进口到美国的鳄梨超过 13 万公吨（143300 短吨，127900 长吨）。
A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.	电脑鼠标是一种手持式指向设备，可以检测出相对于某个平面的二维移动。
This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.	这种移动通常会转换成指针在显示屏上的运动，让用户得以流畅地控制图形用户界面。
The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968.	鼠标控制计算机系统的首次公开展示发生在 1968 年。
Originally wired to a computer, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.	早期的鼠标是用电线连接到电脑上的，而现在，很多鼠标都是无线鼠标，依靠近程无线电通讯与系统进行连接。
Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts.	早期的鼠标利用一个球在桌面上滚动以侦测移动，但现在的鼠标通常利用光感测器，不再设活动部件。
In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.	除了可以移动光标之外，电脑鼠标还有一个或一个以上的按键，利用按键可以在显示屏上进行菜单项选择等操作。鼠标通常还有其他元素，比如利用接触面和“轮子”可以进行额外的控制输入和额外的维度输入。
The earliest known publication of the term mouse as referring to a computer pointing device is in Bill English's July 1965 publication, "Computer-Aided Display Control" likely originating from its resemblance to the shape and size of a mouse, a rodent, with the cord resembling its tail.	已知最早公开利用“鼠标”一词来指代电脑指向设备的人是 Bill English，他 1965 年 7 月发表的一篇文章中第一次提到这个词。以“鼠标”取代“计算机辅助显示控制器”，可能是由于这种连着一根像尾巴一样的连线的设备在形状和大小方面都很像老鼠这种啮齿动物。
The plural for the small rodent is always "mice" in modern usage.	在现代的用法中，"mouse（老鼠）"这种小型啮齿动物的复数一直是“mice”。
The plural of a computer mouse is either "mouses" or "mice" according to most dictionaries, with "mice" being more common.	根据大多数词典，电脑鼠标的复数形式是“mouses”或“mice”，其中“mice”更为常见。
The first recorded plural usage is "mice"; the online Oxford Dictionaries cites a 1984 use, and earlier uses include J. C. R.	据记载，史上第一次表达鼠标复数用的是“mice”。在线牛津字典引用的是 1984 年的一个用法，更早之前的用法包括
Licklider's "The Computer as a Communication Device" of 1968.	J.C.R Licklider 1968 年发表的文章《The Computer as a Communication Device》中的用法。
The term computer mouses may be used informally in some cases.	非正式情况下可能会用“mouses”来表示电脑鼠标的复数。
Although, the plural of mouse (small rodent) is mice, the two words have undergone a differentiation through usage.	虽然"mouse（小型啮齿动物）"的复数是"mice"，但这两个词在使用过程中出现了一些差异化。
The trackball, a related pointing device, was invented in 1946 by Ralph Benjamin as part of a post-World War II-era fire-control radar plotting system called Comprehensive Display System (CDS).	轨迹球也是一种相关的指向设备，1946 年，拉尔夫·本杰明发明了轨迹球，当时是用在二战后的一种叫“综合显示系统（CDS）”的火控雷达绘图系统上。
Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service.	本杰明当时供职于英国皇家海军科技部。
Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick.	当时本杰明的项目是利用模拟计算机，以用户通过操纵杆传来的几个初始输入点为基础，来计算出目标飞机将要飞过的位置。
Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a "roller ball" for this purpose.	本杰明觉得需要把输入设备做得更雅观一点，于是便发明了一种叫做“滚动球”的设备。
The device was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built, and the device was kept as a military secret.	该设备于 1947 年获得专利，但当时还只是一个原型，只是用一个金属球在两个有橡胶涂层的轮子上滚动，而且当时属于军事机密。
Another early trackball was built by Kenyon Taylor, a British electrical engineer working in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff.	早期还有一种轨迹球，是英国电气工程师肯扬·泰勒与汤姆·克兰斯顿、弗雷德·郎斯塔夫二人联合发明的。
Taylor was part of the original Ferranti Canada, working on the Royal Canadian Navy's DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving) system in 1952.	泰勒是早期的加拿大公司 Ferranti 中的一员，1952 年参与了加拿大皇家海军的数字自动跟踪与解决（DATAR）系统的开发工作。
DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin's display.	DATAR 在概念上与本杰明的轨迹球相差无几。
The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions.	轨迹球用四个圆盘来获取运动，X 方向、 Y 方向各两个。
Several rollers provided mechanical support.	有几个滚轮来提供机械支撑。
When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball.	当球滚动时，负责获取运动的圆盘会旋转，其外缘的接触点会与金属丝进行周期性的接触，球每滚动一次，都会产生脉冲输出。
By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined.	通过计算脉冲，就可以确定球的物理运动。
A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals.	数字计算机会计算出球的轨迹，并利用脉冲电码调制的无线电信号将数据结果发送给同一行动组中的其他船只。
This trackball used a standard Canadian five-pin bowling ball.	轨迹球上面的球用的是标准的加拿大五针保龄球。
It was not patented, since it was a secret military project.	由于当时这个项目属于军事机密，因此没有申请专利。
Douglas Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) has been credited in published books by Thierry Bardini, Paul Ceruzzi, Howard Rheingold, and several others as the inventor of the computer mouse.	蒂埃里·巴蒂尼、保罗·库鲁兹以及霍华德·莱茵戈尔德三人在其发表的书籍中，将斯坦福研究所（今 SRI 国际）的道格拉斯·恩格尔巴特誉为鼠标之父。
Engelbart was also recognized as such in various obituary titles after his death in July 2013.	恩格尔巴特 2013 年去世时，各种讣告的标题也是这样写的。
By 1963, Engelbart had already established a research lab at SRI, the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), to pursue his objective of developing both hardware and software computer technology to "augment" human intelligence.	到 1963 年，恩格尔巴特已经在 SRI 建立起一个研究实验室：增智研究中心（ARC），目标是开发计算机的硬件和软件技术来“增强”人类智能。
That November, while attending a conference on computer graphics in Reno, Nevada, Engelbart began to ponder how to adapt the underlying principles of the planimeter to X-Y coordinate input.	同年 11 月，在内华达州里诺市参加计算机图形会议时，恩格尔巴特开始思考如何将测面仪的基本原理应用于 X-Y 坐标系的坐标输入。
On November 14, 1963, he first recorded his thoughts in his personal notebook about something he initially called a "bug," which in a "3-point" form could have a "drop point and 2 orthogonal wheels." He wrote that the "bug" would be "easier" and "more natural" to use, and unlike a stylus, it would stay still when let go, which meant it would be "much better for coordination with the keyboard."	1963 年 11 月 14 日，恩格尔巴特在个人笔记本上首次记录下他的想法，一开始他起名叫“虫子”，这个“虫子”是 3 点一体的，“有一个落点和两个正交的轮子”。他写到，这个“虫子”使用起来会“更容易”，“更自然”，而且和触控笔不一样的是，“虫子”松开时也不会滑走，这意味着它“可以与键盘很好地协调在一起”。
In 1964, Bill English joined ARC, where he helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype.	1964, 比尔·英格利加入 ARC, 与恩格尔巴特一起开发了第一个鼠标原型。
They christened the device the mouse as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail, and in turn resembled the common mouse.	他们将这种设备命名为鼠标，因为早期的模型末端连着一根线，看起来像一条尾巴，使得该设备看上去像一只常见的老鼠。
As noted above, this "mouse" was first mentioned in print in a July 1965 report, on which English was the lead author.	如前面所述，“鼠标”一词于1965 年 7 月在一份报告中被首次提到，而英格利是这份报告的第一作者。
On 9 December 1968, Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would come to be known as The Mother of All Demos.	1968 年 12 月 9 日，恩格尔巴特在一场展示会议会中公开展示了鼠标，这场展示会后来被人们称为“所有展示之母”。
Engelbart never received any royalties for it, as his employer SRI held the patent, which expired before the mouse became widely used in personal computers.	恩格尔巴特从未因此获得任何版税，因为该专利的拥有者是他的雇主斯坦福研究院，专利过期之后，鼠标才被广泛用应用在个人电脑上。
In any event, the invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart's much larger project of augmenting human intellect.	不管怎样，鼠标的发明只是恩格尔巴特增强人类智能计划中很小的一部分，他的计划远不止于此。
Several other experimental pointing-devices developed for Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS) exploited different body movements – for example, head-mounted devices attached to the chin or nose – but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience.	恩格尔巴特还为他的 NLS 系统试验性发明了几款利用到其他不同的身体动作的指向设备——例如，连接到下巴或鼻子上的头戴装置——但最终鼠标以速度和便利性胜出。
The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two potentiometers perpendicular to each other and connected to wheels: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis.	第一台鼠标是一种笨重的设备（如图所示），两个相互垂直的电位器被连接到轮子上，每个轮子的转动都会转化为沿着某个轴的运动。
At the time of the "Mother of All Demos", Engelbart's group had been using their second generation, 3-button mouse for about a year.	至召开“展示之母”大会时，恩格尔巴特团队已经使用他们的第二代鼠标（即三键鼠标）大概有一年了。
On October 2, 1968, a mouse device named Rollkugel (German for "rolling ball") was described as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal was developed by the German company Telefunken.	1968 年 10 月 2 日，德国 Telefunken 公司开发了一种叫做 Rollkugel （德语中“滚动球”的意思）的鼠标设备，据该公司描述，Rollkugel 是作为其终端 SIG-100 的可选设备而开发的。
As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball.	这个名字意味着，Telefunken 这款鼠标和恩格尔巴特的不同，它已经有一个球。
It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named Rollkugel) that was embedded into radar flight control desks.	它是基于早期嵌进雷达飞行控制台中的一种轨迹球式的设备（也叫Rollkugel）而制作的。
This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken Konstanz for the German Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung (Federal Air Traffic Control) as part of their TR 86 process computer system with its SIG 100-86 vector graphics terminal.	这种轨迹球是Telefunken Konstanz 公司的Rainer Mallebrein 牵头研发的，以作为德国联邦航空交通控制研究所的 TR 86 过程计算机系统的一部分， 这种计算机系统的终端支持 SIG 100-86 矢量图形。
When the development for the Telefunken main frame TR 440 began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team came up with the idea of "reversing" the existing Rollkugel into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device.	1965 年开始着手开发 Telefunken 的主框架 TR 440 时, Mallebrein 和他的团队想出了一个主意：将现有的 Rollkugel “逆过来用”，变成一个可移动的鼠标式设备，这样客户在使用早期的轨迹球时就不必为安装孔而烦恼。 
Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968.	这种鼠标设备与光笔、轨迹球一道，自 1968 年起就开始作为他们系统的可选输入设备为他们所用。
Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum.	1972 年在德国慕尼黑莱布尼茨超级计算中心组装的一些 Rollkugel 鼠标，至今仍然完好地保存在博物馆里。
Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.	Telefunken 公司认为这一发明无足轻重，因此没有申请专利。
The Xerox Alto was one of the first computers designed for individual use in 1973 and is regarded as the first modern computer to utilize a mouse.	1973 年设计的 Xerox Alto 是最早的一批个人计算机之一，被认为是第一台使用了鼠标的现代计算机。
Inspired by PARC's Alto, the Lilith, a computer which had been developed by a team around Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zürich between 1978 and 1980, provided a mouse as well.	受到帕洛阿尔托研究中心的启发，苏黎世联邦理工学院的尼克劳斯·沃斯团队 1978 至 1980 年间开发的 Lilith 电脑也是配鼠标的。
The third marketed version of an integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the Xerox 8010 Star in 1981.	第三款上市的整合式鼠标是作为电脑的一部分一起出售的，目的是用于个人电脑导航，并随着 1981 年施乐 8010 star 电脑的问世而问世。
By 1982, the Xerox 8010 was probably the best-known computer with a mouse.	到 1982，施乐 8010 可能已经成为当时最有名的带鼠标电脑。
The Sun-1 also came with a mouse, and the forthcoming Apple Lisa was rumored to use one, but the peripheral remained obscure; Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold lab mice.	Sun-1 也配备了鼠标，当时即将上市的苹果 Lisa 电脑据说也会配鼠标，但人们对该外设的概念仍然很模糊。Mouse House 公司的杰克·霍利表示，某大型公司的一名买家起初还以为他们公司是卖实验小白鼠的。
Hawley, who manufactured mice for Xerox, stated that "Practically, I have the market all to myself right now"; a Hawley mouse cost $415.	为施乐公司生产鼠标的霍利说：“实际上我现在在独享整个市场。”一款霍利鼠标的售价是 415 美元。
In 1982, Logitech introduced the P4 Mouse at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, its first hardware mouse.	1982 年，罗技公司在拉斯维加斯的 Comdex 贸易展上展示了 P4 鼠标，这是该公司生产的第一款硬件鼠标。
That same year Microsoft made the decision to make the MS-DOS program Microsoft Word mouse-compatible, and developed the first PC-compatible mouse.	同年，微软公司决定将其 MS-DOS 系统的程序 Microsoft Word 制作成可兼容鼠标的版本，并开发出了第一款与个人电脑兼容的鼠标。
Microsoft's mouse shipped in 1983, thus beginning the Microsoft Hardware division of the company.	1983年，微软的鼠标产品上市，从此微软变成了一家软硬件兼修的公司。
However, the mouse remained relatively obscure until the appearance of the Macintosh 128K (which included an updated version of the Lisa Mouse) in 1984, and of the Amiga 1000 and the Atari ST in 1985.	然而，人们对鼠标的概念还是相对模糊，直到 1984 年苹果 Macintosh 128K （该电脑包含一个更新版本的 Lisa 鼠标）的问世以及1985年Amiga 1000、 Atari ST 的出现。
Other uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains.	其他利用鼠标进行输入的情况通常出现在特殊应用领域。
In interactive three-dimensional graphics, the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects' or camera's orientation.	在交互式三维图形中，鼠标的运动通常直接转换成虚拟物体或摄像头的方位变化。
For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's "head" faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head.	例如，在第一人称射击类游戏（见下文）中，玩家通常会使用鼠标来控制虚拟角色的“头部”所朝向的方向：向上移动鼠标会让角色抬起头，露出角色头部上方的视角。
A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined.	某个与之相关的功能会使物体的图像转动，这样就可以看到物体的每一面。
3D design and animation software often modally chords many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect.	3D 设计和动画软件通常会以模式化的方式串起许多不同的组合，这样物体和摄像头就可以旋转并在鼠标仅能检测到的几个行动轴线的空间内移动。
When mice have more than one button, the software may assign different functions to each button.	当鼠标有多个按键时，软件可能会为每个按键分配不同的功能。
Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item.	通常，鼠标上的主要按键（右手版鼠标最左边的按键）用来选择一项内容，而次要按键（右手版鼠标最右边的按键）用来弹出一个菜单，显示该选项还有哪些可选操作。
For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.	例如，在有多个按键的鼠标上点击第一个按键时，Mizilla 浏览器会接入一个链接，点击第二个按键时，会弹出一个与该语境相关的菜单，显示该链接的可选操作。点击第三个按键（中间键）时，通常会在新的标签页或窗口打开该链接。
Optical mice rely entirely on one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics.	光电鼠标完全依靠一个或多个发光二极管（LEDs）、一个光电二极管成像阵列来检测相对于鼠标底面的运动，从而避免了在光电的基础上加上机械鼠标那样的内置活动部件。
A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (laser) light.	激光鼠标也是光电鼠标，只不过利用的是相干光（激光）。
The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone.	最早的光电鼠标是在预先印妥的鼠标垫表面来探测鼠标的移动的，而现代的 LED 光电鼠标则多数在不透明的漫反射面上工作。这种鼠标通常无法探测出单向反射面上的移动，比如抛光石。
Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces.	利用激光二极管还可以获得更高的分辨率和的精准度，从而可以更好地在不透明单向反射面上使用。
Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.	无线光电鼠标由电池供电，其 LED 灯间歇性闪烁以减少耗电，只有在检测到移动时才会持续发光。
Often called "air mice" since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other accelerometer (US Patent 4787051) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported.	惯性鼠标通常被称为“空气鼠标”，因为这种鼠标不放在一个表面上也能操作。惯性鼠标利用音叉或其他加速度计（美国专利 4787051）来检测每一个所支持的轴的转动动作。
The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation.	最常见的模型（由罗技公司和 Gyration 公司制造）利用两个度的旋转自由度来工作，对空间平移不敏感。
The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or "gorilla arm".	用户只需稍微转动一下手腕就能移动光标，从而减少了用户疲劳，避免“麒麟臂”。
Usually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position.	这种鼠标一般都是无线的，通常有一个开关，不用的时候可以关闭活动电路，这样用户就可以动来动去而不会影响到光标位置。
A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use.	某惯性鼠标的专利描述中表示，这种鼠标相比光电鼠标耗能更少，灵敏度更高，重量更轻，操作更加简单。
In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.	惯性鼠标与无线键盘的结合提供了符合人体工学的其他选择，因为这样的安排无需平坦的工作桌面也能工作，从而潜在地缓解了工作中与姿势有关的一些重复性动作损伤。
Also known as bats, flying mice, or wands, these devices generally function through ultrasound and provide at least three degrees of freedom.	这种设备也被称为“蝙蝠鼠标”、“飞鼠鼠标”、“魔杖鼠标”，通常通过超声波发挥作用，支持至少三个度的旋转自由。
Probably the best known example would be 3Dconnexion ("Logitech's SpaceMouse") from the early 1990s.	最著名的例子大概是 20 世纪 90 年代初的 3Dconnexion 鼠标 (“罗技的太空鼠标”) 。
In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse.	20 世纪 90 年代末，Kantek 推出了 3D 指环鼠标。
This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons.	这款鼠标使用时手指套在一个环内，利用拇指来控制三个按键。
The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.	这种鼠标由一个基站来对其进行三个维度上的跟踪。
Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.	这种鼠标虽然有一定的呼声，但终究没能走入市场，因为它无法完全解决人们的需求。
One example of a 2000s consumer 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote.	21世纪初市面上的 3D 指向设备的其中一个例子是 Wii Remote。
While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation).	Wii Remote 主要用作动作感应设备（也就是说，它可以确定动作的方位和方向），但也可以利用与之一体的红外摄像头（由于该双截棍手柄没有摄像头，只能测得当前的朝向和方位），通过对比红外发射器所发出的光的距离和位置，来测出空间位置。
The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar.	这种方法的明显缺陷是其摄像头可以看到感应条但只能生成空间坐标。
More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system.	自此之后，市场上推出了更加精确的设备，包括 PlayStation Move、Razer Hydra 以及 HTC Vive虚拟现实系统的控制器部分。
All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.	这些装置都可以准确侦测出三维空间中的位置和方向，不管其相对于感应站是什么角度。
A mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped.	一款与鼠标相关的控制器叫 SpaceBall，有一个置于工作台上的圆球，很容易抓握。
With spring-loaded centering, it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes, in both directions for each.	其中心位置以弹簧支承，可以感应所有六个轴上每一个轴的的平移和角位移两种位移方向。
In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse.	2010 年 11 月，一家名为 Axsotic 的德国公司推出了一款叫“ 3D 球面鼠标”的新概念 3D 鼠标。
This new concept of a true six degree-of-freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations.	这款新概念鼠标是一款真正的六自由度输入设备，使用一个球在三个轴内自由转动，不受任何限制。
In 2000, Logitech introduced a "tactile mouse" that contained a small actuator to make the mouse vibrate.	2000 年，罗技公司推出了一款“触觉鼠标”，内含一个小致动器，可以使鼠标振动。
Such a mouse can augment user-interfaces with haptic feedback, such as giving feedback when crossing a window boundary.	此款鼠标可以通过触觉反馈更好地增强用户界面的使用效果，例如在越过窗口边界时鼠标会提供反馈。
To surf by touch requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness; this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice but never marketed.	以触摸的方式来上网要求用户必须能够感觉到深度和硬度，这种能力曾在第一款电流变触觉鼠标上实现过，但该款鼠标一直没有上市。
Tablet digitizers are sometimes used with accessories called pucks, devices which rely on absolute positioning, but can be configured for sufficiently mouse-like relative tracking that they are sometimes marketed as mice.	平板数字化设备有时会与一种叫做 pucks 的配件一起使用，这种设备依赖于绝对定位，但也可以配置成完全类似于鼠标那样的相对跟踪，因此这种设备有时会被当作鼠标出售。
As the name suggests, this type of mouse is intended to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries.	顾名思义，这种鼠标旨在提供最佳舒适感，使用户免受腕管综合症、关节炎等重复性劳损疾病的伤害。
It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.	它顺应手部的自然位置和动作而设计，能够减轻使用时的不适。
