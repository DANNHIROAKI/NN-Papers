# Grow BERT

This directory contains code for
[On the Transformer Growth for Progressive BERT Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12562).
The proposed method CompoundGrow speeds up BERT pre-training by 73.6% and 82.2%
for the base and large models respectively while achieving comparable
performances. Code will be released for reproduction and future studies.
