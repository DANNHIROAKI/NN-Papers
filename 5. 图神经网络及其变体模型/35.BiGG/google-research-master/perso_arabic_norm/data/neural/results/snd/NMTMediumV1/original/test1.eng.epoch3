The Day of the Day of Resurrection
We worship Thee, and we will help you.
And give us the right path.
The path of those whom Thou hast bestowed, not of those who have evoked, nor of those who are astray.
Alif Lam Mim.
This is the Book, there is no doubt in the Book, but Allah guides the pious.
Who believe in the Unseen, and perform the prayer, and spend what We have provided for them.
And who believe in that which has been revealed to you and what was sent down before you, and those who believe in the Hereafter.
These are the guidance from their Lord, and these are the successful.
Verily, those who disbelieve, warn them, warn them, or warn them; they will not believe.
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearts, and their eyes is a veil, and there is a great punishment for them.
And among mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers.
They deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none but only, and they do not perceive.
There is a disease in their hearts, and Allah has increased their disease; for them is a grievous punishment.
And when it is said to them: "Make not mischief on the earth," they say, "We are only reformers."
These are the hypocrites, and they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people believe," they say, "Shall we believe like the fools?" They say, "We believe as the fools do not know."
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their devils, they say, "We are with you; we are only mocking."

These are the ones who have purchased error in error, and they have not guided them, nor did they guide them.
Their likeness is like the likeness of the fire, when he kindled a fire, Allah threw away their light, and their eyes fall away, and they will not see.
They are deaf, dumb and deaf, and they will not return.
Or as it is like the sky, as if they fall into the darkness of darkness and lightning, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and their fingers in their hearts; and Allah is the Knower of the disbelievers.
Their eyes are almost a veil, and when they fall into it, they will fall therein, and when they fall into it, they will find their eyes, and if Allah wills, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their sight, and Allah is Able to do all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may be pious.
Who has made the earth a resting for you and the sky, and sends down rain from the sky, and sends down water from the sky; and then you do not associate with Allah with a goodly provision.
And if you are in doubt about that which We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it, and call your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do not do it and do not do it, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for those who disbelieve.
And give those who believe and do good deeds, for them shall be Gardens of rivers flowing beneath them, and they shall say, "This is what we had given us." They will say, "This is what we had given us." They will say, "This is what we had done before us, and they shall abide therein."
Allah has not invented a gnat for a gnat or a gnat; and those who believe know that they know that it is the truth from their Lord; and those who disbelieve say, "This is what Allah has ordained for you." He will not guide many of them, but He will guide many of them, and He will guide many of them. He will not guide many of them.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after it became clear after them, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and spread mischief on the earth; they are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were dead, and He gave you life, then He gave you life and causes you to die, then He will give you life, and to Him you shall be returned.

The Lord answered his Lord, saying, "My Lord, grant me a gift for me, for You are the All-Hearer."
And the angels called to him in prayer, saying, "Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya, and confirm the Word of Allah, and the chaste and the righteous, and the righteous among the righteous."
He said, "My Lord, how can I have a son when I am old old age, and my wife is barren?" He said, "He will take it to Allah."
He said, "My Lord, this is a sign for me, and He said, "This is a sign for you." But when the Lord's name comes to you, he will not speak to them the night and the evening, and the morning and the evening.
And when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds.
O Mary, worship your Lord, and bow down and bow down with those who bow down.
This is the news of the unseen which We reveal to you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam), and you were not with them with them, but when they cast lots with arrows, they should not be able to be with them with Mary, nor do they argue with them.
“And when the angels said, ‘O Mary, Allah gives you glad tidings of a word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, distinguished in this world and in the hereafter, and among the company of the righteous.
He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity, and he shall be one of the righteous.
He said, "My Lord, how did I not have a son when I have touched me?" He said, "Allah creates what He wills." He said, "It is He Who creates it, and He is it."
And He will teach the Book and the Gospel and the Gospel and the Gospel.
And He sent to the Children of Israel a prophet, and said, "I have come to you from your Lord, and I am a sign from your Lord, so that I may take you as a grain of mustard brass, and it will be a grain of mustard brass, and it will be as a grain of corn, and it will be as a grain of corn; and if you eat, you will be in the midst of Allah.
And confirming what was before me, confirming what was before me, and forbid what has been forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord; so fear Allah and obey me.
Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.
Then when they saw their disbelief, he saw him, he said, "Shall Allah be my helper?" The disciples said, "We are God's helpers. We bear witness to Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims."
Our Lord, we believe in what We have revealed, and follow the Messenger and follow the Messenger.
And they plotted, and Allah planned; and Allah is the best of planners.
And when Allah said, "O Jesus, I will raise you to Myself and purify you and purify those who disbelieve and purify those who disbelieve and follow those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then I will judge between you concerning the Day of Resurrection. I will judge between you concerning what you differ."
As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe torment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will not have any helpers.
And those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, they will pay them full of their rewards; and Allah does not love the unjust.
That is We who recite to you the Book and the Book and the Book.
“The likeness of Jesus before Allah is as the likeness of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, ‘Be,” and he was.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.
And if you argue with them with knowledge, say to them, "We will be with your sons and your sons and your women and your women and your women and your women and your women and your women and your women and your women, and we pray for Allah."
This is the truth, but Allah is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise, the All-Wise.
But if they turn away, then surely Allah is Ever-Knower of all things.
Say: "O People of the Book! come to common terms between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that we associate not with Him, and that none of us take others as lords."
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about the religion of Abraham, and the Torah and the Gospel and the Gospel, so that you may not understand?
(116) (116) (106) And are ye of those who dispute about that which ye have knowledge, while ye dispute not?
Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a Jew, and he was not of the idolaters.
The people of Abraham (Abraham) are one of those who follow him, and the Messenger, and the Messenger, and the Messenger, and Allah is the Protector of the believers.
The People of the Book among the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, and they follow themselves not, and they do not perceive.
O People of the Book, why do you not believe in Allah's signs, and that you are witnesses?
O People of the Book, why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?
And some of the People of the Book said: "Believe in the day of the People who believe in the morning, and disbelieve in the morning, and disbelieve in the meeting of the meeting.
And do not believe except those who follow your religion, but say: "The guidance is only to Allah," and say: "Do not believe," and they say, "This is what you have been given to you." Say, "It is only for those who believe in Allah and His Lord. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
He grants mercy on whom He pleases, and Allah is the Owner of bounty.
And among the People of the Book, if they are given a portion of them, they will leave you with it, and if you find them, they will not leave you, and if you find them, it will not be for you. That is because they say, "We are not responsible for you." But if they say, "We will not be able to talk."
Nay, whoever fulfils his pledge and fears Allah, then surely Allah loves those who fear Him.
As for those who sell Allah and their Messenger, for a small price, they will have no portion in the Hereafter, nor will they be in the Hereafter, nor will they look on the Day of Resurrection, nor will they look on the Day of Resurrection, nor will they be a grievous chastisement.
And among them are some of the People of the Book that they make their tongues, so that you may think it is the Book, but it is not the Book. They say, "This is from Allah." They say, "This is from Allah." They say, "This is nothing but a lie."
It is not Allah who gives the Book to teach him the Book and the wisdom and the Prophethood, and he says: "I have submitted to my Lord." Say: "I have submitted to you the Book and the Book."
And the angels and the angels and the prophets do not believe in your Lord, and He will judge you, then will He then reject you?
And (remember) when Allah took the covenant with the Children of Israel (saying): "Take you the Book and give you a Messenger, and then a Messenger will come to you, and you will help him, and help him, and help him."
But whoever turns away from it, then are the transgressors.
Do they seek other than Allah, who is in the way of the heavens and the earth, willingly, willingly, willingly, willingly, and unwillingly?
Say, "We believe in Allah and what We have revealed, and that which is revealed to us, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and the Prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the Messengers, and the Messengers, and we are in the believers."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.
Allah will guide those who reject the religion after they have disbelieved, and they bore witness, and the Messenger is clear, and there is signs with them. Allah does not guide the unjust people.
These are the ones who have incurred the curse of Allah and the angels and the angels and all mankind.
They shall abide therein, and they will not be punished, nor shall they be respited.
Except for those who repent and amend, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
But those who believe after their belief, then increase their disbelief in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted; and they are indeed astray.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the earth will not be accepted from the earth, and it will not be accepted for him; they will not be accepted from it, and they shall have no helpers.
By no means will you attain righteousness unless you spend, and spend what you spend, and whatever you spend, Allah is Knowing of what you do.
And all of the children of Israel have been given lawful for the Children of Israel, confirming what was forbidden before him, and Moses said, "Bring you what you say, if you are truthful."
But whoever fabricates a lie against Allah, they are the transgressors.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists."
Verily, the first House for mankind was the first for mankind, and a guidance and a guidance for the worlds.
There are clear proofs in the Qur'an, and whoever enters the promise of Abraham, and whoever enters it, and enters it, and Allah's House is for mankind; and whoever disbelieves in the way of Allah; surely Allah is Independent of all things.
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you not believe in Allah's signs, and that which you do, you will be the witness of Allah?"
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you seek for those who believe in Allah's way, and do not make it crooked?
O you who have believed, if you obey a group of the People of the Book, then disbelieve, then reject the believers, and reject the disbelievers.
How are it that you disbelieve in Allah's Signs, and His Messenger is the Messenger of Allah and His Messenger and His Messenger, and whoever is the guided of the Straight Path?
O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast in Allah's presence, and do not quarrel in the bounds of Allah, and remember the favor of Allah's favour, and when you were enemies of the nations, and you were separated from the brink of the Fire, and you were separated from the brink of the Fire, and you were enemies of the brink of the Fire. Thus Allah makes clear to you His communications, so that you may be guided.
And let a group of them speak to the righteous, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and forbid the wrong-doers.
And do not be like those who are divided, and follow the Signs after clear proofs, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.
On the day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be blackened, and those who are black will say, "Why will you reject faith after accepting you reject faith? So taste what you have disbelieved."
And those whose faces are whitened will be admitted to Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the Signs of Allah, which We recite to you, and Allah does not want to destroy the unjust.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and to Him is the return of all things.
You are the best of the people, who enjoin you to do good, and forbid what is right, and forbid what is lawful and forbid in Allah's faith, and if the People of the Book had believed, it would be better for them, and most of them are transgressors.
They will not be able to do any harm except for you, but if they fight with you, they will have their backs, and they will not be helped.
They will have a portion of Allah's people, except for the people and the people, but they have incurred for Allah's sake, and they have been sealed by Allah's anger. That is because they disbelieved in Allah's communications, and they have been cursed. This is because they disobeyed the communications of Allah, and they are transgressors.
They are not like the People of the Book; there are a group of the People of the Book who recite the verses of Allah during the night, and recite the prayer.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right, and forbid what is right and forbid what is right. They are the ones who are righteous.
And those who do not do good deeds will not be denied of them; and Allah is Knowing of the pious.
Those who reject Faith will not avail their wealth nor their children will avail them from Allah; they will be the inmates of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
The likeness of the life of this world is like the likeness of a parable which is like the likeness of the earth, as a likeness of a people who have wronged themselves, and it destroys their souls, and it is not for them; and Allah has not wronged the unjust.
O you who have believed, do not betray those who do not believe, but do not follow it for those who disbelieve, lest they do not harm you, lest they dislike you, they will be niggardly. But their breasts is clear. We have made you clear signs. Thus We have explained for you a clear signs.
They are those of you who do not love, and do not love those who do not believe. And when they meet you, they say, "We believe," and when they meet you, they say, "We believe," and when they meet it, they say, "It is not for Allah."
If it is good for you, it grieves them, and if you are afflicted with hardship, it will be for you; and if you do, then, it will not avail you; and if you are patient, you will not be able to frustrate them with Allah.
And when you entered your home at the day of the believers, they will find them in the stations of Allah, and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
“And when the two parties had come to them, they would not be able to help them, and Allah is with the believers.
And Allah had helped you in the midst of Badr, so that you might help them, and fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
And when you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels?
But if you are patient, and the enemy, and the enemy, then come against them, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels.
And Allah has not granted the glad tidings of good tidings for you, and that your hearts may be your hearts; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
It is He who cut off the unbelievers, lest they leave them, or expose them.

And those who, when they commit an indecency, or commit their own souls, remember Allah, remember Allah, and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives sins but sins, and do not persist in what they have done.
The reward of their Lord will be forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and that which is the reward of the righteous.
Many have passed away before you many years, so travel in the land and see how was the end of the disbelievers.
This is a sign for mankind, and a guidance and a admonition for those who fear (Allah).
“And do not weaken nor grieve, and if you are believers, you will surely be victorious.”
If they have afflicted you, they have despaired of those who disbelieve, and We are the ones who are in the midst of the disbelievers, and that Allah may know those who believe, and that Allah may know those who believe, and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test those who believe and deny the disbelievers.
Do you think that you will enter Paradise in the Garden of Allah, and who are not of those who are patient, and are patient of those who are patient?
And indeed, you have been given for death before death, and you have seen it, and you see it.
And Muhammad is the Messenger of a apostle; then if he dies, then if he dies or dies, then will you turn back on your heels? But if he turns away from his heels, Allah will not grant him any harm; and Allah will reward them for the thankful.
And he does not die except by Allah's permission, but We give him the reward of this world; and whoever desires the reward of this world, We will give him the reward of this world; and We shall reward the reward of the Hereafter; and We shall reward the grateful.
And many of the prophets were among Allah's Messenger, and they did not kill themselves, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken.
And they said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses and make us our feet and make us victory over the unbelievers."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter, and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who have believed, if you obey those who disbelieve, they will surely turn you back on your heels, and you will be losers.
Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allah. They ascribe not to worship Allah with what He has sent down, and their abode will be the Fire, and it is the abode of the wrongdoers.
And Allah has promised the promise of your promise, so that you may break him with him, and when you were disputing with him, then you disputed with him, and disputed in what you have been given, and you disputed in the way of Allah, and He has given you the knowledge of which He pleases, and He gave you the way of the Hereafter; and He gave you the way of the Hereafter; and Allah is gracious to the believers.
And when you have turned away, then do not stand at it, and when the Messenger comes to you, and the Messenger will be called to you, and you will not be requited for what you have earned, and that you may not be granted a trial for what has been given for you; and Allah is well aware of what you do.
Then He made it a veil for you, and a group of them were a party of them, and some of them were a party of them. They said: "Why do we not forbid what Allah has done for us?" They said: "What has us done for us?" They said: "What is what we have done for us." Say, "It is not for us that Allah is with us, and that which is in your hearts." Say, "It is only for us."

And if you are killed or die in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah is far better than all that they amass.
And if you die or die, you will be brought back to God.
That is the mercy of Allah on the mercy of His mercy, and if you were rough hearted, they would have dispersed from you, and if you were rough hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from you, and ask forgiveness for them, and ask forgiveness for them, and ask forgiveness for them; surely Allah loves those who trust.

They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them, and those who are behind them, and those who are behind them, and those who are behind them, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in Allah and His bounty, and Allah does not reward the believers.
And those who responded to Allah and His Messenger after the Messenger, and those of them who are righteous, and fear them, for them is a great reward.
The people said to the people, "Woe to those who fear them, so fear them," but it increased their faith, and they say: "Sufficient for us is Allah."
So they returned to Allah's bounty and bounty, and touched them not, nor did they find him; and Allah is the Owner of bounty.

And do not think that which Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty, lest it is good for them, it will be better for them, and it will be better for them.

Allah has heard the words of those who say, "If Allah is poor, we are poor and poor, and we will say, 'We write it with the Jews and the prophets, and we will be the Penalty of the burning."

They say, "Allah has promised us a messenger." They will not believe until a apostle will be given to Us. Say: "Messengers have come to me before me." Say, "I have sent messengers before you." Say, "I have sent messengers before you, if you are truthful."

And We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We gave him a covenant between Allah, and He said, "I am with you, and if you perform the prayer, then I have given you a goodly reward, and if you obey the poor and pay the poor and obey the poor, and Allah will surely forgive you, and admit you into the way of the Prophet; surely He is a transgressor, a doubter."
So, for their breaking of their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts firm for their hearts, so that they may not leave them, and that they may have a portion of them; and if they have been reminded of them, they will not know it; and pardon them; surely Allah loves the righteous.
And those who say, "We are Christians," and they were reminded of what they were reminded of them, and they were reminded of them, and We gave them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection; and Allah will inform what they do.
O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, revealing to you much of what you used to hide in the Book and passing much much, and much of you have come to Allah and the Book of the Book.
Allah guides those who pursue His pleasure, and brings them out of darkness into His mercy, and guides them from the darkness of darkness, and guides them on the straight path.
Indeed, those who say, "Allah is Christ, son of Mary." Say, "Who is the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and all that is between them?"
The Jews say, "We are the sons of Allah and the Christians." Say: "Shall we say, 'Why do you say," Say: "He will punish your sins, and for whom He pleases, and whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases, and He will forgive whom He pleases, and whom He pleases, and whom He pleases, and He will be the dominion of the heavens."
O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam), until the Messenger has come to you, lest you should say, "There is no bringer of good tidings to come to us, nor bearer of glad tidings, and to come to us, and to come to us, and to warn the warner."
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people, remember Allah's favor upon you when He appointed among you prophets and made you possessors and gave you what He had not given to the worlds.
O my people, enter the holy land which Allah has assigned to you and do not turn back ignominiously, and turn away from your heels.
They said, "O Moses, indeed there is a great nation, and we will not enter it until it comes until it comes. If they cease, we will surely enter it."
Two of those who fear Allah and those who feared Allah, saying, "Assault them, until you enter them into the gate, then enter them in the gate, and if you are in the presence of Allah, you will be victorious."
They said, "O Moses, we will not enter it therein, until they will remain therein therein, and you will find your Lord.
He said, "My Lord, I have no authority between me and my brother, and let us judge between us.
He said, "It is forbidden for them for years for years, and they will not walk in the land, but you will not be blamed."
And relate to them from the sons of Adam (Adam) with the story of their fathers, and they had not accepted the one of each one of them, and the one of the two of them had been accepted, and it was said to them: "You shall surely die."
And if you stretch me to kill me and kill me, I will not kill you until I kill you; I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
I wish that you will be my sin, and you will be the dwellers of the Fire, and you will be the dwellers of the Fire, and the wrong-doers will be the recompense of the wrong-doers.”
Then he decreed his brother to kill his brother, and he killed him, and he became one of the losers.
Then Allah caused him to see the earth in the land, and he said to his brother, "Woe to me! I will surely forbid my brother, but I will be like the like of my brother." Then he turned away from his brother, and he became one of the repentant.
“That is for the Children of Israel that We should give it to a person who is in the land, and whoever goes on the earth, but if it is like the earth, it will be like it, but if he saves it, it will be as if he had saved mankind.
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this is a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.
Except those who repent before you repent, then know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek Him and strive in His way, and strive in His way that you may prosper.
Verily, those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), if they are in the earth, and if it comes to them, it will be a ransom for them from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, but it will not be accepted from them, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.
They will return to the Fire, but they will not be able to fall from it, and they will not be able to be punished.
And the thief and the brothers, and cut off the hands of the hands of Allah, is a recompense of their hands; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
But whoever repents and does righteous deeds, then surely Allah will relent to him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do you not know that Allah is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and He punishes whom He pleases, and forgives whom He pleases? And Allah has power over all things.
O Prophet, let not those who disbelieve say to those who disbelieve in their disbelief, saying, "We believe," they say, "We believe," and not their hearts, and their hearts, and the Jews, and those who are Jews, and those who are Jews, and they will not be able to make it clear to them. They say: "This is not for it." They will say, "This is not for it." They will say, "This is not for it." They will say, "This is not for it." They will say, "This is not for it." They will not be able to take it astray.
Those who deny the lie of falsehood, and if they desist, then if you come to them, then judge between them, and turn away from them, and turn away from them, and turn away from them. If you judge between them, then judge between them; surely Allah loves those who do good.
And how will they judge for you concerning that which is before them, and it is written with them, and they turn away from Allah, and they are not believers?
And We have sent down the Book, and a guidance, and a light, and a confirmation of the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and those who have been given the Book; and they fear not that which Allah has given to them, and they have no fear; so fear them not, and fear Me, and fear Me; for those who disbelieve not are disbelievers.
And We have ordained for them a example in this world, and a nose for the nose, and a nose for the nose, and for a nose, and a tooth, and a tooth for the tooth, and for the tooth, and for the tooth, and for a tooth, it is for him; and whoever forgives that which Allah has sent down, it is not for the unjust.
And We sent down to them Jesus, son of Mary, confirming what was before him, and We gave him the Gospel, and We gave him the Gospel and the Gospel, confirming the Torah, confirming it, confirming the Torah, and the Gospel, and a admonition.
And the People of the Book will judge in what Allah has sent down, and whoever does not judge in what Allah has sent down to them, they are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (the Qur'an), confirming the Book, confirming the Book which is before the Book, and that which is before them, and that which Allah has revealed to you, and that which is revealed to you, and that which is true to them, and that which Allah has sent down to you, then do not follow their own desires; and if Allah willed, He will have made you a single nation.
And judge between them that which Allah has sent down, and do not follow their caprices, lest they do not follow their caprices, lest they turn away from Allah, and let them turn away from Allah, and if they turn away, Allah will punish them for their sins; and most of mankind are transgressors.
Or do they seek for the permission of Allah, and it is better than the people of the Book?
O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Then you see those whose hearts are in their hearts, and they will say, "We fear lest some misfortune befall us." But Allah will change them, so that Allah may change them from His hearts, and they will be forgiven.
And the believers will say, "Are these the ones who swore by Allah by His strongest oaths?" They will say, "We are only to you." They will be lost.
O you who have believed, if he turns away from his religion, then Allah will bring them out of Allah's people, and they will love those who disbelieve, and those who disbelieve will be hard for those who disbelieve, and do not fear the way of Allah. Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Your ally is only Allah and His Apostle and those who believe, and perform those who perform the prayer and pay the zakat.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and the women of the believers; surely Allah is the predominant of the mighty.
O you who have believed, those who have been given the Book and those who have been given the Book, do not create for those who have been given the Book, and do not create the unbelievers and the unbelievers.
And when they call the prayer to the prayer, they ridicule it with mockery and mockery. This is because they are the people of understanding.
Say, "O People of the Book, do you resent us because we believe in Allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before us?"
Say, "Shall I tell you more than Allah that which Allah has cursed for those whom Allah has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those of you who are rebellious, and are far astray?
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe," but when they disbelieve, they are averse to it; and Allah is most knowing of what they hide.
And most of them see many of them, and the sin of sin, and the devouring of the poor, and the devouring of the poor, and that which they have done.
Do Allah not forbid them and those who are divided with their tongues, and do not forbid the unlawful of the unlawful?
And the Jews say: "Allah is with his hands, and their hands are niggardly, and their hands are vain for their hands; but it is not for them, but it is not for them." But if they are niggardly, they will not be niggardly; but it is only for those who are niggardly, and it is not for their Lord, and He has made it a trial for those who disbelieve and do not follow the mischief of the earth. Allah loves not the mischief.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared, We would certainly have seized them from their sins and admitted them into the Gardens of Delight.
And if they had known the Torah and the Gospel and the Gospel, they would have been given to their Lord, and there is a barrier between them; and many of them are a party of them; and most of them are evil.
O Messenger, what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not do it, you will not be delivered by His message; and Allah will protect you from mankind; and Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book (Jews and Christians), do not follow until you follow the Taurat (Torah), and the Gospel (Gospel), and the Gospel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel), and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord (i.e. the Taurat), and do not follow the disbelievers.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous deeds, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
We have made a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We sent messengers to them, but whenever any apostle came to them, they would not desire their hearts, but they slew them, and they slew them.
And they thought that it was not a trial, and they became blind blind blind; and Allah turned away from them, and many of them became blind; and many of them are blind; and Allah sees what they do.
Those who say, "Surely, Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary," and they say, "O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord, and your Lord, and this is your Lord, and whoever is the abode of Allah, and his abode is the Fire."
Those who say: "Allah is with the Jews," they say, "There is no god but Allah." But if they do not desist, it will be a grievous torment. But if they do not desist, those who disbelieve will be a grievous Penalty.
Will they not then turn back to Allah and seek His forgiveness? God is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was not a apostle, but he had passed away before him, and his mother had passed away before them. Look in the sight of their mother, and they eat it. See how We explain to them the signs of the signs.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which has no power to benefit you or harm it, and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Say, "O People of the Book, do not exceed the limits of the bounds of the limits, nor follow the limits of the people, and have gone astray, and have gone astray astray, and have gone astray astray, and have gone astray astray."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and the son of Mary.
They did not forbid one another for what they used to do.
You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve, for those who disbelieve have passed before them before their own souls, because they are in Allah's wrath, and they will abide in the punishment of Allah.
And if they had believed in Allah and His Messenger and that which was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends, but many of them are transgressors.
You will find no fault in the Jews and the polytheists among the polytheists. They say, "We are Christians," and say, "We are Christians." But if they say, "We are Christians." But if they are among them, they are not proud.
And when they hear what has been sent down to the Messenger, they will see their eyes overflowing with tears, and they say, "Our Lord, we believe in our Lord, so write us down among us."
And what is it that we should not believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, so that our Lord may admit us in the company of the righteous among us?
And Allah will admit them to Gardens, beneath which rivers flow, and rivers shall abide therein forever; and He is the best of the righteous.
And those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, these are the inmates of the Fire.
O you who have believed, do not exceed the limits which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not exceed the limits; surely Allah loves not transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has bestowed with you, and eat that which is lawful for you, and fear Allah.
Allah has not ordained for you by the oaths that you may not eat, and that you may not eat it; and if you eat, it will be for you; and if you eat, it will be for you; and if you are pregnant, it will be for you, and if you are pregnant, they will be cut out of your houses. That is what Allah has ordained for you, that you may be grateful.
O you who believe! intoxicants and gambling, and the idols of the devils and the devils are the abomination of Satan; so turn away from them so that you may be successful.
Satan has forbidden the burden of the Satan and the needy, and the hatred of the poor and the destitute, and the remembrance of the remembrance of Allah and the remembrance of the remembrance of the remembrance of Allah and the remembrance of the remembrance of Allah. Will you not then return?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not follow the Messenger; and if you turn away, know that Our duty is only for the Messenger.
As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, they shall not be afraid of it, nor do good deeds; and those who believe and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who have believed, let it be for you, and you will be in your hands, and let them know that Allah is with you, and that he may know that he fears what is in the fear of his fear, and whoever is a grievous punishment for those who repent.
O you who have believed, do not spend the bounds of the earth, and do not spend the limits of the soul, and whoever is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a one of you who is a enemy, or a one of you who is a enemy, or the one who is the one who is a enemy, or a one of you who is a enemy, or is the one who is the enemy, or is the one who forgives the forgiveness of Allah? And Allah is Mighty, Merciful.
It is He who has made the sea for you, and it is for you to eat, and for it is for you, and for it is for you, and for the poor, and for the pilgrimage, and that which is forbidden for you, and fear Allah, and fear Him.
Allah has made the Ka'an for the Sacred House, the Sacred House, and the Sacred Mosque, and the Sacred Mosque, and the Sacred Mosque, and that which is in the land. That is that Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger's duty is only only to convey the Messenger, and Allah knows what you conceal.
Say (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): "The hypocrites are not the good and the good, but it is a good thing for you; so fear Allah, so that you may be successful."
O you who have believed, do not ask about them about the truth if it is clear to you, and if you ask it, then ask it for you, for Allah will forgive you. God is Forgiving, Merciful.
A people before the people before them asked it, and they rejected them.
Allah has not made the Qur'an for a Bahirah or a camel, nor is the Wasilah of Allah, or the Hami of Allah, and most of them reject the lie, but most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," they say, "Sufficient for us is that which we found our fathers." But if their fathers did not know, they are not guided.
O you who have believed, if you have been guided, you will not be able to follow it; but if you are guided, it will not harm you; then Allah will tell you what you do.
O you who have believed, when there comes to you a group of a group of a believer, some of them, and some of the two parties of the two parties are among you; but if you are in the land, then be among them, and say, "If you are in the land, then be among the earth." But if they are in doubt, they will not be able to say, "We swear to Allah." They will not be ashamed of Allah's leave, so that they may be sinners.
But if they know that they were guilty of the other, then they both are the one of the Jews, and they swear to them, and they swear by Allah, and they swear by Allah, and they swear to Allah, and they would not be able to bear witness to them.
That is that they should be told by the truth, lest they should be ashamed of their oaths, lest they fear their oaths, and fear Allah, and fear Allah. God does not guide the unjust people.
On the Day when Allah will gather them together, He will say, "What is what you say?" They say, "We have no knowledge," and they say: "We have no knowledge of Allah. You are the Knower of the unseen."
And when Jesus, son of Mary, said, "The son of Mary, I seek refuge with him and his parents, and give me a favor to my parents, and I will make you a share in the land, and I will make you the Book, and I will make you the Book, and I will teach you the Book, and I will make it clear to you, and I will make it clear to you, and I will make it clear to you." The unbelievers said, "This is nothing but obvious sorcery." But when the Children of Israel go with you, it is clear to them. This is nothing but magic.
And when I inspired the disciples, "Believe in Me and My Messenger," they said, "We believe, and bear witness that we are Muslims."
And when the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord sent down to us from heaven?
They said, "We wish to eat it, and our hearts and hearts know us, and we know the truth, and that we may be witnesses."
Isa, son of Mary, said, "O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven, so that we may be a sign for us and the last of us and the last of us. You are the best of us, and You are the Best of providers."
Allah said, "I will send you down, and whoever follows you, then I will certainly punish you with a severe chastisement."
And when Allah will say, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, do you not say to mankind, ‘Worship me and my mother as my mother?” He will say, "I am the truth," and it will be said to him, "I know what is with me, and I know what is in your hearts." But if it comes to me, he will surely know what is in your hearts, and He is the Knower of all things.
Never said to them aught except that which Thou didst command me, saying, "Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord, and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt over them, and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt over them. You are the Watcher over all things."
If you punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say: This is the Day when the truthful will profit their truthfulness, for them shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall abide therein forever; they shall abide with ever; and Allah is with those who are pleased.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in the earth, and He is Able to do all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and has made it light and light; then those who disbelieve are disbelievers.
It is He Who has created you from clay, then He has decreed for you a term, and a term is a term, and then you will be questioned.
And He is Allah in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what is hidden, and He knows what is hidden and what you do.
There will not come to them a sign from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
That is the truth when it comes to them, but they reject it, but they will soon come to them with a clear news.
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them, and We have established the earth in the earth, and We have not given it to them, and We have made the sky to flow for them, and We have made it rivers flow for them, and We have made it to grow with them.
And if We had sent down to you a Book in the Book, and they touched it with their hands, the disbelievers would certainly say, "This is nothing but obvious magic."
And they say, "Why has not a angel been sent down to him?" And We sent down to him a angel, and they would not have been given it, but they would not be respited.
And if We had made him a angel, We would certainly have made him a human being, and We have made it a sign for them.
And indeed We mocked before you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam), but those who were warned by them were mocked, but they used to ridicule them.
Say: Travel in the land and see how was the end of the deniers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Who is the dominion of the heavens and the earth? Say: "Allah is the One Who has mercy on His mercy, and He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection." He will not be asked of the Day of Resurrection. They will not believe in it.
And to Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall I take refuge from Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He gives sustenance to His sustenance, and He will not give provision to His sustenance. Say: "I am commanded to be the first of the first."
Say, "If I fear not, I fear the punishment of my Lord."
On the day when he will be averted from the Day of Judgment, Allah will have mercy on them, and He is the Manifest achievement.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, He is not able to remove it; but if He touches you, He is Able to have power over them.
He is the All-powerful, the All-knowing, the All-knowing, the All-knowing.
Say, "What is it that you say that Allah is most more than me, and that I have witness between you, and that which is revealed to me, and that which has been revealed to me?" Say: "This is not a sign for you."
Those who have given the Book follow it, but they know those whom they recognize their sons, and they do not believe in it.
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah, or denies His communications, and who is not the unjust?
And on the day when We shall gather them together together, then We will say to those who associated partners, "Where are those whom you used to associate besides Allah?"
Then they will not say: "By Allah, we will not be able to worship us with our Lord."
See them, how they lie, and they have invented it.
And among them are some of them who listen to you, and We put their hearts into their hearts, and We do not understand in their hearts; but if they see the signs, they will not believe in it; but if they see the truth, they will not believe in it; but those who disbelieve will not believe.
And they turn away from it, and they turn away therefrom, and they do not destroy except except, but they do not know.
If you see them, they will say, "If it is for the Fire, they will say, "If we would return, we will not reject the signs of our Lord, and we will not reject the signs of our Lord."
Nay, it is those who have passed away before it, but if they were returned to it, they would not be able to be able to fall away, but they are liars.
And they say, "This is nothing but the life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected."
And if you see them, if they are before their Lord, he will say, "Is it not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by your Lord!" They will say, "This is the punishment which you used to disbelieve."
Those who disbelieve in Allah's meeting will be lost, and when the Hour comes to them, they will say, "We have no hope for what we have done for us." They will say, "We have been evil for us."
And the life of this world is only amusement and amusement; and those who fear Allah are the abode of the Hereafter; then do you not understand?
Verily, We know that they say, "We will not grieve you; but it is not for you, but they reject the communications of Allah."
And indeed Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient, and they were patient, and they were patient with them, and when Our help came to them, there is no god but He; and verily, He was of the Messengers.
And if their turning away from them, you would surely find it if you are in the earth, or if you are in the earth, a sign to them. If Allah willed, He would have given them guidance and guidance. But if Allah willed, they would not be of the ignorant.
Those who listen to Him hear the prayer, and Allah will resurrect them on the Day of Resurrection, and to Him will be returned to Him.
And they say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "Allah has power over them, but most of them do not know."
And there is no animal on the earth, nor is there a bird like the wings of the heavens, and there is a bird like them; but We have not neglected the Book, and they shall be brought to their Lord.
And those who reject Our communications are deaf and dumb in darkness; and Allah guides whom He pleases, and whomsoever He wills, He will guide whom He pleases.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Have you considered if the punishment of Allah comes to you or the Hour come to you, then call upon Allah, if you are truthful?
Nay, but if you call upon Him, He will call upon Him, and if He wills, He will remove upon you, and you will not forget what you worship.
And We have sent before you (O Muhammad sal-Allaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) before many nations, and We seized them with adversity and adversity, so that they might be humble.
So when they had come to them from Our punishment, they would not fear their hearts, and their hearts were hardened, and they made it easy for them.
So when they were reminded of what they were reminded of them, We opened their doors to them, and We seized them with what they had done, but We seized them, but they were not waiting.
And the people of the wrong-doers are the people, and all praise belongs to Allah, and He is the Lord of the worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you see what Allah has opened for you and your eyes, and has sealed your hearts, will He then bring you up besides Allah?
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you know that Allah will punish you from the torment of Allah, or openly, or will he destroy the unjust people?"
And We have sent the Messengers and the bearer of glad tidings and warners, and those who believe and do not believe, there shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And for those who reject Our communications, they will be punished by their punishment.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that Allah is the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I tell you the knowledge of the unseen, nor do I follow it." Say, "I am the blind." Say, "I will not follow it."
And fear those who fear the meeting of their Lord, lest they fear them, and there will be no protector for them, and that they may fear Allah.
And do not turn away from those who invoke their Lord in the morning and the morning, seeking His countenance, and do not turn away from them, for they will not find them, but you will turn away from them; and you will surely be among those who do wrong.
And We made some of them some of them so that they say: "Are these the ones whom Allah has given us?
And when those who believe in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, verses, lessons, signs, signs, signs, revelations, etc.) come to you, say, "Peace be upon you, and your Lord has mercy on His mercy, so that He may change the evil of you in ignorance, and thereafter repents in ignorance, and thereafter repents in ignorance."
And thus We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) for them, and to make it clear to the wrong-doers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Call upon me besides Allah that which has been forbidden for me, and do not follow my whims, and I do not follow the desires of my religion.
Say, "I am a clear proof from my Lord, and I lie for you, and you deny that which you have done for me. This is nothing but Allah's permission. He gives the truth to the truth, and He is the best of judges."
Say, "If I had been given to you, and if it was been for me, it would have been settled between me; and Allah is All-knowing, all-knowing."
And he is the keys of the Unseen, and He knows none but Allah knows, and He knows what is in the earth, and He is not a leaf, nor is there a leaf from the earth, nor is it a leaf, nor is it a atom's weight of the earth, nor is it a clear Book.
It is He who takes you into the night, and He knows what is in the day of the day; then He raises you up, then He raises you a term; then He raises you the term, and He will inform you what you will do.
And He is above His servants, and He takes up over you a veil, and when you die, We will not kill His angels, and they will not be able to do it.
Then they will be brought back to Allah. He is the Truth, and He is the decree of His decree, and He is the swiftest of reckoning.
Say: "Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and sea, when you call upon Him, secretly, and secretly?" Say, "If we are grateful, we will surely be grateful."
