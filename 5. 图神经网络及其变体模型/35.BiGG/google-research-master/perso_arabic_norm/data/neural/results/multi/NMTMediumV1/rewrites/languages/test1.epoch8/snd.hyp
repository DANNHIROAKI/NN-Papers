In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
The Beneficent, the Merciful.
The Day of Judgment,
You alone alone, and we worship, and we do not help.
Guide us on the straight path.
The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not incurred the wrath of those whom you have bestowed upon, nor are the astray.
<unk>
This is the Book whereof there is no doubt in it; there is no doubt in it.
who believe in the unseen, and establish the prayer, and spend out of what We have provided them.
Who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, and believe in the Hereafter.
They are on guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.
As for those who disbelieve, whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their eyes have fallen upon them, and there is a great punishment for them.
And among mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do not believe.
They seek to deceive Allah and the believers, but they deceive themselves but they do not understand.
In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has increased their sickness. They will have a painful punishment.
And when it is said to them: "Make not mischief in the earth," they say: "We are only reformers."
Indeed, they are the mischief, but they do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Believe of those who believe," they say: "Shall we believe like those who believe?" Nay, they are the fools, but they do not know.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, “We believe”; but when they are alone with their devils, they say, “We are with you; we are only ridiculing.”
Allah mocks them at them, and letteth them wander blindly in their exorbitance.
These are they who have purchased guidance for guidance, so their bargain have not profited them, nor are they guided.
Their likeness is like the likeness of a man who kindled a fire, and when he illuminated him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness.
Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return.
Or like a rainstorm from which is like the sky, thunder, thunder, thunder, and lightning they thrust their fingers in their ears. God encompasses the unbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away their sight, but when the lightning brightens them, they walk therein, and when they are set up, they stand on it. Had Allah willed, He could have taken their hearing and their sight. God has power over all things.
O mankind! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you, so that you may be godfearing.
Who has made the earth a bed for you, and the sky a canopy, and sent down water from the sky as a provision for you. So do not knowingly set up rivals to Allah.
And if you are in doubt with what We have revealed to you, then produce a chapter like it, and call your call to Allah, if you are truthful.
But if you do not, then you will not, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, that they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a fruit of its fruit, they will say: "This is what we had been promised before." And they will be purified therein, and they will abide therein.
It is not possible for those who disbelieve, without Allah's revelations, except a gnat, and those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord. And those who disbelieve say, “These are Allah’s creation?” Allah leads astray and causes astray to stray, and He leads astray to whomever He wills, and He does not guide the transgressors.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the earth. These are the losers.
How do you disbelieve in Allah, when you were dead, then He gave you life, then He will bring you life, then He will bring you life, then to Him you will be returned.
He it is Who hath created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned Himself into the heaven, then He made seven heavens and the earth; and He is Knowing of all things.
And recall when your Lord said to the angels: "I am a viceroy in the earth." They said, "Who will make it who will cause corruption in the land, and shed blood and blood, and we glorify Your praise, and we glorify Your praise." He said: "I know what you do not know."
And He taught Adam all the names, and He presented them to the angels, and said, “Bring your names, if you are truthful.”
They said: "Glory be to Thee! We know that which You have no knowledge, but Thou art the All-knowing, the All-wise."
He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names. Then when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what ye hide and what you hide?
And when We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves before Adam”; so they prostrated, except for Iblees; he refused, and waxed proud, and became one of the disbelievers.
And We said: O Adam! Dwell ye and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye thereof plenteously thereof, and eat not approach this tree, lest thou shouldst be of the wrong-doers.
Then Satan made them slip from it, and caused them to be in the ground, and We said to them, “Go down to you, and you will be enemies to you, and you will have a share of the earth.”
Then Adam received from his Lord, and He accepted him; surely He is the All-returning, the All-compassionate.
We said, "Get down from it, all of you. If there comes to you a guidance from Me, whoever follows My guidance, no fear shall be upon them, nor shall they grieve.
But as for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the inhabitants of the Fire; therein they shall abide forever.
O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me, and fulfil your covenant, and fear Me alone.
And believe in what I have sent down confirming what is revealed to you, and do not be the first of those who disbelieve, and do not sell My verses for a paltry price, and fear Me.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth while you know the truth.
And establish regular prayers and pay regular charity, and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin the good deed, and forget yourselves while you read the Book? Do you not understand?
And seek help in patience and prayer, and indeed, it is a difficult loss for those who believe.
who know that they will meet their Lord, and to Him they shall be returned.
Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you to the worlds.
And fear of the Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor shall they be helped.
And remember when We saved you from the people of Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with a dreadful punishment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. In this was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you and saved you, and drowned Pharaoh's people, and you were beholding.
And when We appointed for Moses forty nights, then you took the calf, and you were unjust.
Then after that We pardoned you, so that you may be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.
And when Moses said to his people, “O my people, you have indeed wronged yourselves to your own calf; so turn your repentance towards your Creator, and kill your brother. That is the best of you in your sight. He is All-forgiving and All-merciful.’
And when you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah visibly." But the thunderbolt struck you while you were looking at.
Then We revived you after your death, so that you may be grateful.
And We shaded you with clouds, and We sent down upon you manna and quails, and quails: Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you; and We did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves.
And when We said, “Enter this town, and eat of it wherever you wish, and enter the gate prostrating humbly, and say, “We shall forgive you your sins, and We will forgive you, and We will increase the virtuous.”
Then the wrongdoers changed the word of one another than another. So We said to them, “We have sent down upon the wrongdoers a punishment from heaven, so that they were debauchers.”
And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, “Strike your staff with the rock.” And gushed forth from it twelve springs, and each tribe knew its drinking-place. “Eat and drink from Allah’s sustenance, and do not roam the earth, spreading corruption.”
And when you said, "O Moses, we do not ask you for a place of this world, and our Lord will make us enter our place, and your Lord, and your women, and your mates, and your mates, and your mates, and your mates, and your mates, and your mates, and your mates, and your Lord’s mercy is upon you. In fact, they have been given the people of the signs of God and the prophets of the prophets unjustly." So they destroyed the signs of Allah, and the prophets killed for them.
Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do righteous deeds, their reward is with their Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And when We took a covenant from you and raised the Mount above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you and remember that which is in it, so that you may fear.
Then after that you turned away, then it was not for the favor of Allah and His mercy upon you, and you would surely be among the losers.
And indeed you know those of you who transgressed about the Sabbath, and We said to them, “Be apes, despised.”
So We made it a deterrent for them, and a guidance, and a guidance, and a lesson for the pious.
And when Moses said to his people, “God commands you to sacrifice a cow.” They said, “Are you mocking us?” He said, “I seek refuge from Allah, the ignorant, the ignorant.”
They said, “Pray to your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what she may be.” Moses said, “God says, she says, neither, nor virgin, nor virgin, and you are commanded.”
They said, “Pray to your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what she may be.” He said, “Indeed, Allah says, she is a yellow cow.’
They said, “Pray to your Lord for us to make clear to us what she may be to us. Indeed, it is all that we are commanded.”
He answered: "He says, "It is a cow, that she may be a cow, neither yoked to plow the soil, nor to irrigate the fields of the fields, and there is not for any other." They said: "Now you come to us," and they sacrificed her, and they were not doing.
And when you killed a man, then you disagreed about him, and Allah knows what you conceal.
We said, “Strike him with a part of it.” Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, so that you may understand.
Then your hearts became hardened, as though they were like rocks, and harder in rocks; and there are rocks from which rivers burst forth, and there are some rocks which split asunder from them; and there are some rocks which split asunder from Allah; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you think that you will believe in the way of Allah? Of them are a group of them who speak to the words of God, and they understood it, though they understood it.
When they meet those who believe, they say, “We believe”; and when they are alone with each other, they say, “What is the matter of Allah to you, so that you may argue with your Lord?” Do you not understand?
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose?
And among them are unlettered who know the Book, but they do not follow the Book, but they are only guessing.
So woe to those who write their hands with the Book, and say, “This is from Allah,’ so that they may sell it for a paltry price; and woe to them for what their hands have earned, and woe to them for what they used to earn.
And they say, “The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days.” Say, “Have you taken a covenant from Allah?” Say, “Do Allah not break His promise, or do you say?”
Nay, but those who are evil, and his own deeds are the Fire; they are the inmates of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, they shall be the inhabitants of Paradise, therein dwelling forever.
And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel (saying): Worship none but Allah. Be good to your parents, and to relatives, and the orphans, and the orphans, and speak kindly to the people, and establish the prayer, and establish the prayer, and pay the alms, and pay a few of you.
And when We took your covenant from you, saying, “Do not shed your blood, nor your people’s blood, and you confirmed your homes, and you were witnesses.”
And you killed the people of your people, and let a people a multitude of the people, and the other among the other, and the angels came to you from the other. And if you had come to them, they would not give you a great number, but if you had come to them, they would not have been given you. So, when the Book is given to you, they would not be able to make a life of the life of the world, and the punishment of the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Those are the ones who buy the life of this world for the price of the Hereafter, so their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.
And We gave Moses the Book, and We sent after him other Messengers. And We gave Jesus the son of Mary, clear signs, and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Whenever there not come to you an apostle from that which you did not desire, you grew proud.
And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, Allah hath cursed them for their disbelief; so they believe not.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is with them, and when they had prayed to victory for the disbelievers, they would have disbelieved in it. But when it came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it. And Allah is the curse of the disbelievers.
What is they that which Allah has revealed to them, that they may disbelieve in what Allah has sent down, and that He may reveal upon His servants, He chooses of His servants, and He chooses for them wrath. And for the disbelievers is a disgraceful punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down,” they say, “We believe in what we have been sent down to us,’ and what they do not believe in what it has been revealed, the truth say, “Why is the God’s Prophets,” and what is the truth. Say, “Why do you not kill Allah’s prophets, if you were believers?”
Moses came to you with clear signs, but you took the calf, and you were wrongdoers.
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you, and hearken, and hearken: We hear, and they said: We hear and we obey. And when their hearts were averse to the calf, they would say: verily ye believe in that which ye believe.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If the abode of the Hereafter is for you (i.e. the Day of Resurrection, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.) of Allah (i.e. the Day of Resurrection, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.) of Allah (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), you will give death for death.
And they will never long for death for what their hands have sent ahead, and Allah knows the unjust.
And you will find them to be a greediest of men among mankind, and among those who associate others in the mushriks. Each one of them will give a life of years, but he will not remove his punishment. God sees what they do.
Say: "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel,- he has sent it down to your heart by Allah's command, confirming what was before it, and guidance and glad tidings to the believers.
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His angels and Gabriel and Michael and Michael, then surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.
And indeed We have sent down to you clear signs, and none will not deny the disbelievers.
Is it not a covenant that they have made a covenant, so that some of them are a party of them? Nay, most of them do not believe.
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah, confirming that which Allah has sent down from them, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, though they know not.
And they followed him, who were devoted by the worship of Allah, and of the people of Musa, and the people who were killed to the people who were killed, and they were a people who were not guided to them. And they were not one of the angels, and they were divided to the like of it. And they were not one in the least, but they did not believe in the way of Allah. And they did not give any one of them, except that they had no knowledge, and they would not be able to make a great punishment.
And if they had believed and were cautious, they would have received a reward from Allah, if they but knew.
O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous words, but say, “Unzurna,’ and listen to the unbelievers; and the unbelievers will have a painful punishment.
The unbelievers among the People of the Book and the idolaters will not have been any good to you from your Lord. But Allah chooses from His mercy whom He wills. And Allah is the possessor of great bounty.
And We bring a verse to a verse, or whether We abrogate it, We bring it a better or a better like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? And besides Allah, you have no protector or helper.
(Muhammad), do not ask your Messenger to ask you to be questioned? Whoever exchanges the faith of belief, he has gone astray from the right path.
Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you back to you, after you have believed, after their hearts have become clear to them, and then forgive them, and forgive them, and forgive them until Allah has decreed His command. God has power over all things.
And establish your prayers, and give the alms, and whatever good you will find, it will be with you; and Allah sees what you do.
And they say, “None will enter Paradise except a Jew or the Christian.” Say, “These are their own selves.” Say, “Produce your proof, if you are truthful.”
Nay, but whoever submits his face to Allah, and is a good deed, his reward is with his Lord; and no fear shall be upon them, nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say: "The Jews are not grounded on the Jews," and the Christians say: "The Jews are not grounded on anything." Even though they are given the Book, the same of the same are like those who do not know. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning their differences.
And who is more unjust than he who forbids the name of Allah and strives to be mentioned, and striveth to their ruin? There is not for them to enter that which they enter, but there awaits them in the life of this world; this is the punishment of the world, in the Hereafter.
To Allah belong the East and the West. Whichever turn you turn away. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
And they say: Allah hath taken a son for Himself. Glory be to Him. Nay! He is the All-Knower in the heavens and the earth, and unto Him are the obedient.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, "Be," and it is.
Those who do not know say say: "Why does not Allah speak to us or why a sign come to us?" Thus those who were before them said, "Their hearts are alike." In fact, We have made the signs clear for them, so that they may believe.
Indeed, We have sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) with the truth, as a bringer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned of the inmates of hell.
And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the Christians, nor do they follow their creed. Say: 'Allah is the True guided." And the knowledge of the Book has come to you, so that you follow their desires. And if you follow their desires, you would have no protector or helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it ought to read it. Those who believe in it, it is they who are the losers.
O Children of Israel! Remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you above the worlds.
And fear the Day when no soul shall avail another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted from it, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will they be helped.
And when Abraham (Abraham) came to his Lord, and he fulfilled them. He said, "I am a leader of you." Abraham said, "I am only a descendants of my descendants." He said, "The wrong-doers, the All-doers."
And recall when We made the House a place of place for mankind and a place of place and a place of worship, and We made Abraham standing to the House of Abraham, and We charged Ibrahim and Ismail, and the House, and those who stand down, and those who bow down, and those who bow down, and those who bow down and prostrate themselves.
And when Abraham prayed, "My Lord, make this city a place of security, and provide its people with fruits, for them believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said: "I will give him a enjoyment of enjoyment for a short time, then I will compel him to the punishment of the Fire, and then I will be an evil destination."
And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, and prayed: Our Lord! Accept from us; surely Thou art the Hearer, the Knower.
Our Lord, make us submissive to Thee and make our descendants submissive to Thee, and make us worship of our Lord and forgive us. You are the All-forgiving, the All-merciful."
Our Lord, raise them a Messenger from among them, who will recite to them Your revelations, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are the All-mighty, the All-wise."
And he who follows the religion of Abraham (Abraham), except the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham), and We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, “Surrender!” he said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds.”
And Abraham enjoined his sons and his sons, and said, “O my people, Allah has chosen you, so do not die except for the Muslims, except Muslims.”
Were you witnesses when the man of Jacob approached, when he said to his sons, "What will you worship after me?" They said, “We will worship your God and your fathers, and the God, Isaac, and Ishaq, and God is the One, the Most Merciful.”
That was a community which has passed away. Theirs shall be repaid for what they earned, and you will be repaid for what you used to do.
And the Jews say, “Be Jews or Christians, or you will be guided.” Say, “Rather, the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist, the Monotheist, and he was not one of the polytheists.”
Say: "We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to us, and what was sent down to Ibrahim and Ismail, and Ishaq, and Ishaq, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to Moses and Jesus and Jesus and the prophets, and what was sent upon their Lord, and to Him we submit.
And if they believe in you (O Muhammad SAW), they believe in it. But if they turn away, then they are in schism. And Allah will suffice you against them. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
“To Allah belongs the truth, and who baptizes better than Allah, and we worship Him.”
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Why do you dispute concerning us concerning Allah? He is our Lord and your Lord. To us belong our sins and your deeds for your deeds. And we are the worshippers of Him."
Or do you say that Abraham, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Jacob, and Jacob were Jews? Say: 'Are you better or Allah?" And who is more unjust than one who conceals the testimony of Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
That was a nation that have passed away. Theirs shall be what they earned, and you shall be questioned for what you earned, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
The foolish among the people will say: “What has turned them away from the direction of their fathers?” Say, “The East and the West belong to God; He guides whom He wills, and He guides whomever He wills.”
And thus We have made you a community like you, that you may be a witness to you, and a Messenger, and a witness between them; so that they may follow the religion of Allah, and that they may turn back to his heels; and whoever turns on the way of Allah, he will have suffered for them. And Allah is the Compassionate, the Merciful.
We have seen your face to the heaven, so that you may turn your face to Him. So turn your face to your face, and turn your face toward your Sacred Mosque. And you will turn your faces towards your Lord. Those who were given the Book know that it is the truth from their Lord. God is not unaware of what they do.
And even if you should bring them to the Book, they would not accept your giblah, nor do they follow your giblah; nor do they follow the qiblah of their qiblah; and if you follow their desires after the knowledge after you follow their desires, then you would surely be among the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. But some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the skeptics.
Every one has a direction toward which he inclines. So race to one another in good works. Wherever you will be, Allah will bring you all together. God has power over all things.
And wherever you turn forth, turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque. It is the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn forth, turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you turn upon, turn your faces towards your faces, so that you may not have any argument except against those who do wrong, so that you may have no argument against them, and fear Me; and I will show you to His blessing, and you will be guided.
We have sent a Messenger to you from among you, who recites to you Our verses and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and remember Me, and do not be ungrateful.
O you who have patience, be patient and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.
And do not be like those who are killed in the way of Allah. They are alive, but they are alive.
And We shall try you with something of fear and hunger and loss of loss and lives and lives, and give glad tidings to the patient.
Who, when a calamity befalls them, they say: "We are Allah, and to Him we shall return."
They are the ones from their Lord and mercy and mercy. It is the right path.
Safa and Marwa are the waymarks of Allah. Whoever performs the House of the House, or performs the House, and performs the House, and whoever does good in the name of Allah, it is no sin on him. God is All-knowing and All-knowing.
Those who conceal the Book and the guidance which We have revealed to them, after We have made clear to them the Book, the curse of Allah and the cursers, and the cursers will be seized by the cursers.
Except those who repent, and make amends, and make amends, then I am the All-forgiving, the All-compassionate.
Those who disbelieve, and die, and those who disbelieve, they are the curse of Allah, and the angels, and the angels.
Abiding therein forever; their punishment shall not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
Your God is One God. There is no god but He. He is the All-merciful, the All-merciful.
In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the ships that sail upon the sea, and He sends down water from the sky, and He sends down water from the sky, and in the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth.
And among mankind are those who take up others other than Allah, as they have set up rivals to Allah. And those who believe are in Allah's love. And those who were unjust will see the punishment when they see the punishment, and that Allah is all-powerful and all-powerful.
And when those who followed those who followed them, they will see the punishment, and they will be seized by their forelocks and their feet.
And those who followed will say: "If only we had been sent to us, we would disown them." Thus, they have forsaken them for their deeds, and they will not be brought out from the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is lawful on the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is your open enemy.
He only prompts you to commit evil and indecency, and that you do not know of Allah that which you know not.
And when it is said to them: "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say: "Nay, but we found our fathers following our fathers." Even though their fathers had no knowledge, nor were they guided?
The likeness of those who disbelieve is like the likeness of a man who shouts to one another, but none hear nothing but shouts, and they do not understand.
O you who have believed, eat of the good things which We have provided you, and give thanks to God, if you worship Him.
He has forbidden you only carrion, blood, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which has been slaughtered to other than other than other than the name of Allah. But whoever does not transgress, does not transgress in the limit, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Indeed, those who conceal what God has sent down of the Book, and purchase a small price for a small price, they shall not eat their bellies. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will they have a painful punishment.
Those are they who have purchased error for error, and punishment, and the punishment of the Hereafter.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book with the truth, and those who differ concerning the Book are in extreme dissension.
In the first side of the heavens and the West, it is no good for you; he has no good reward in the heavens and the earth, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the believers, and those who believe in it, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and the poor.
O you who have believed! It is not for you to inherit the case of which you will be able to be able to make a share of his parents, so that it may be clear to him, and his wife is a woman who is entrusted to his brother, so that he may not take their brother after a few. And whoever turns away, then let it be a sign from your Lord. And whoever transgresses after him has been a painful punishment.
There is a lesson for you in retaliation, in order that you may be godfearing.
It is prescribed for you when death approaches one of you, if he leaves wealth, he bequeath to parents and relatives. This is a duty for the pious.
But whoever changeth it after he has heard it, his sin is only upon him. Indeed Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
But he who fears the testator's deviations or sin, and he who commit a sin between them, he shall be no sin; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who have believed, prescribed it was prescribed for you as those who passed behind before you, so that you may be godfearing.
Fast of a number of days; then whoever is sick, then on a journey, or on a journey, on the number of a number of days, on the number of the day of which he is a ransom. And whoever volunteers a poor deed, it is more for him. And whoever volunteers good, it is better for you, if you only knew.
There is a chapter that has been revealed to a people who have been sent down to the people in the Book, and has sent down the Book and the Book, that you may be a one in a part of the two one of you. It is not for you to bring a part of a part of the one. He will give you to task in the land. He will give it to you for your own hardship. He will give you to account of hardship.
And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then I am indeed nearmost; I answer the call of the suppliant when he calls to Me; therefore let them respond to Me, and believe in Me, so that they may believe.
It is not for you to inherit your wives, except that they have been given you, except that they have not seen you, so that you may know you, and He will turn your backs on you, and He will forgive you, and He will forgive you, and you will not be able to do so. And you will not be able to maintain what Allah has ordained for you, and you will eat that you may not be able to do. Thus Allah makes clear to mankind what you will not be felicitous.

Our Lord, forgive us, and to Him only is the return.”

It is He who has sent down the Book to you, clear signs. These are the ones who are the Book, and some other are in the hearts of those who believe in it. And those who are in their hearts are not in the same state of the same. And Allah knows the unseen, and what they possess.
Our Lord, do not make our hearts deviate to make us deviate, and grant us mercy from Your mercy. You are the All-forgiving, the All-forgiving."
Our Lord! You shall gather you together on the Day of Resurrection; surely Allah does not break His promise.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them against Allah's help. They will be the fuel of the Fire.
Like the people of Fir'aun (Pharaoh), and those before them. They denied Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and Allah seized them for their sins. And Allah is Severe in penalty.
Say to those who disbelieve: "You will be gathered into Hell, and will be mustered to Hell."
There was a sign for you in the battle of the two parties, a sign in the fighting of Allah, and the believers, and the believers. They saw their vision to their eyes. But Allah strengthens whomever He wills. There is indeed a lesson in that for those who reflect.

And those who are the Muttaqun (pious-doers, etc, etc.) are with their Lord, underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever, and the companions of the Garden (of Allah) will be in which rivers flow, and Allah is the All-Seer of His servants."

To Allah belongs the religion of Islam. And those who were given the Book disagreed to differ after having been given to them. And whoever disbelieves in the revelations of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in reckoning.
And if they dispute with you, say, “I have submitted myself to Allah, and whoever follows me.” And say to those who have been given the Book, “Do you submit yourselves?” If they were guided, they are rightly guided, but if they turn away, you would turn away from the right path. God sees the servants.
Those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and slay the prophets unjustly, and slay those who enjoin justice among justice, give them a painful punishment.
These are the ones whose deeds have been annulled in this world and in the Hereafter, and they have no helpers.
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God to arbitrate between them, and they turn away, and they turn away.
That is because they say: "The Fire will not touch us except for a limited number of days."
How will it be when We gather them together on the Day of which there is no doubt, and every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O Allah! Owner of the kingdom! You give sovereignty to whom You will, and You strip sovereignty from whom You will, and You endue to whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will. You are the Best of all things."
You cause the night to pass into the day, and You make the day to pass into the day, and You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring forth the living from the dead, and You give sustenance to whom You will without reckoning.”
Let not the believers believe for the believers; and whoever does not do the way of Allah, there is no one of you in the least. And Allah warns you to fear, and Allah warns you to Himself, and Allah is the All-returning to all things.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whether you conceal what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows what is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And Allah knows all that is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Able to do all things."
On the Day when every soul shall be confronted for itself, and what it has done, it will find it for itself, and he will wish that there was a great distance between them. And Allah warns you from Himself; and Allah is Gentle to you.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you love Allah, follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

And when she said to her, she said: "O my Lord! I am a female." And Allah knew what she knew. And the female said: "I am not a child, and I have named her Mary, and I have named her Mary, and I commend refuge from the Shaitan."
Her Lord accepted her with her, and made her grow with a goodly growth, and Zechariah made her grow with her. Whenever Zechariah entered her in the sanctuary, he found her. He said: "O Mary, this is your Lord." She said: "This is from Allah." And Allah provides for whomsoever He wills without reckoning.
And Zachariah prayed to his Lord, saying: O my Lord! Grant me from Thee a goodly offspring; verily Thou art the Hearer of Prayer.
As he stood praying in the sanctuary, the angels called out to him, saying: "Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya, the Word of Allah, and the chaste, and a prophet, and a prophet.
He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when old age hath come to me and my wife is barren and my wife is barren. He said: Allah doeth what He will.

And when the angels said, “O Mary, God has chosen you and purified you, and He has chosen you above the worlds.”
Mary, worship your Lord, prostrate yourself, and bow down with those who bow down."

And when the angels said, “O Mary, God gives you glad tidings of a Word from Him, whose name is the Messiah, son of Mary, son of Mary, and in the Hereafter, and in the Hereafter.”

And We sent the Children of Israel with the Children of Israel. He said, “I have come to you from a sign from your Lord.” Indeed, I brought you forth from the earth, but it was a sign from it, so that he may be carried by the command of Allah, and the birds, and the blood, and the blood, and the blood, and the soul, and the earth, and your skins, that you are believers.
And confirming what was before me of the Torah, and to make lawful to you some of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you from a sign from your Lord. So fear Allah and obey me.
Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is the Straight Path.’
When Jesus sensed their faithlessness, he said: "Who will be my helpers in the way of Allah?" The disciples said: "We are Allah's helpers. We believe in Allah and bear witness that we are Muslims."
Our Lord, we have believed in what you believe, and we follow the Messenger, so bring us the witnesses.”
And they plotted, and Allah planned, and Allah is the Best of planners.
And when Allah said, “O Jesus, I am going to kill you and will take you up to Myself, and I will purify you with those who disbelieve, and I follow you with the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me you will return, and I will judge between you regarding what you used to differ.”
As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a terrible punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they shall have no helpers.
And as for those who believe and do good deeds, He will pay them their reward in full; and Allah does not love the unjust.
This We recite to you the verses, the Wise, the Wise.
The likeness of Jesus in the sight of Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, and then said: "Be!"
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among the skeptics.
Then whoever disputes with you after what has come to you, say, “Come, let us summon our sons, and your sons, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and your women, and pray upon us, and pray upon the curse of Allah.”

But if they turn away, then Allah knows the mischief of the agents of corruption.
Say: "O People of the Book! Come to us (O Muhammad SAW) with a witness (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and a witness between us, and we worship none but Allah, nor associate partners to us, and associate not any partners as Lords besides Him." And if they turn away, say: "Bear witness that we are Muslims."
O People of the Book! Why do you argue about Abraham, though the Taurat and the Injil were not sent down after him. Do you not understand?
What you have disputed about what you have knowledge about, then you have no knowledge about what you do not know? God knows and you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian, nor a man, nor was a Muslim; and he was not of the idolaters.
The people of Abraham are those who followed him, and those who followed him, and the Prophet, and the believers. God is the Guardian of the believers.
A party of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they lead none astray except themselves, but they perceive not.
O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, whereas you are witnesses?
O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and conceal the truth?
A group of the People of the Book say: "Believe in what has been revealed to those who believe in the beginning of the morning, and disbelieve in the morning."
And do not believe in the religion of your religion. Say, "The guidance of Allah is the guidance." Say, "Do not believe like you like what you have been sent down?" Say, "The Hand of Allah is above the greatness of the heavens and the earth." Say, "All Allah's hand is in the hands of the heavens and the earth. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
He singles on whom He wills, and He is the possessor of great bounty.
Among the People of the Book is some who, if you entrust a treasure with him, will restore it to you. Among them there is some of them, if you entrust him with a dinar, it would not be entrusted to you. That is because they say for the people who say, "We are not to be a people who have been given to the people of the Book." And they attribute the truth.
But as for him who keepeth his trust and fears Allah, then Allah loves those who keep off.
Those who sell God's covenant and their oaths for a paltry price, for a small price, shall have no share in the Hereafter. God will neither speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
And among them are those who distort the Book with their tongues, that you may recite their tongues, though it is the Book of the Book, and they say, “This is from Allah.” And they say, “This is from Allah.” And they say, “This is from Allah,” and they speak lies against Allah.
It is not for a human being to whom Allah has bestowed down the Book and the Wisdom, and the prophethood, and the prophethood, who would say, "Be my servants rather than Allah." Say, "God is my Lord, the Book, the Book.
He would not command you to the angels and the angels, but you were commanded to obey your religion.
And remember when Allah took a covenant from the Prophets, and the Book, and the Wisdom, confirming the Book, confirming that which you have come to you, and that which you come to him, he will have come to you and him. He said, “Bring your trust, then, when you are commanded, then I will give you a witness.” They said, “We bear witness, and I am witness with you.”
Then whoever turns away after that, they are the transgressors.
Do they seek a religion other than Allah, and whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they shall be returned.
Say: "We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Jacob, and the tribes, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets, and the prophets, and their Lord, and we make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, he will not be accepted of it; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.
How can Allah guide a people who have believed after their belief, and they bore witness that the Messenger has come to them. And Allah does not guide the unjust.
Those are they for whom Allah is the curse of the angels, and the angels, and all mankind.
Abiding therein forever; their punishment shall not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.
except for those who repent and reform and reform. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.
Those who disbelieve after their belief, then disbelieve in their disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted; and they are the losers.
As for those who disbelieve, and die disbelieving of the disbelievers, as though he had not done to the earth, it will not be accepted from it, nor will they be able to ransom it. They shall have a painful punishment.
You will not attain righteousness until you spend what you spend in the way of Allah, and whatever you spend. Allah knows all that you do.
All food was lawful for the Children of Israel except what Israel forbade unlawful to the Children of Israel. Say, "Bring the Torah, if you are truthful."
Then those who invent lies against Allah are the unjust.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah is the truth (i.e. the Jews), the true religion (i.e. the religion of Islamic Monotheism), and the religion of Ibrahim (i.e. the religion of Islamic Monotheism), and he was not of the polytheists.
Indeed the first House of the House is made the house of the House; blessed is the blessed place for all mankind.
In it are clear signs, the Station of Abraham. And whoever enters it is safe in it; and whoever enters it is safe to the House of Allah; and whoever disbelieves, let it is to Allah, and whoever disbelieves, then Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say: "People of the Book! Why do you not disbelieve in Allah's revelations, and Allah is witness to what you do?"
Say: 'People of the Book, why do you make the people who believe from the way of Allah, seeking to make it crooked? Do you know that God is not unaware of what you do?"
O you who believe! If you obey a party of those who were given the Book, they will turn you back to your faith.
And how can you disbelieve, when the verses of Allah are recited to you, and His Messenger is His Messenger? Whoever cleaves to Allah, He has guided the straight path.
O you who have faith, fear Allah, and do not die except Muslims.
And hold fast by the command of Allah, and be not divided, and remember Allah’s favour upon you, and remember He’s blessing, and He became your hearts, and He became your hearts, and He would make you taste His grace, and He will have saved you from the fire of which you were killed. Thus Allah makes clear His signs to you, so that you may be guided.
And let there be a group among you who invite others to be good, enjoining what is right and forbid what is wrong; these are the successful.
And be not like those who separated themselves after themselves had come to them, and they have come to them, and theirs is a great punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be whitened and some faces are blackened. Those whose faces are blackened will say to those who disbelieved, “Taste the punishment of your disbelief.”
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, in which they will abide forever.
These are Allah's revelations, which We recite to you in truth; and Allah does not love the unjust.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. To Allah belongs all matters.
This is the same religion which you have made a nation. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is right, and you believe in Allah. And if the People of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are believers and most of them are transgressors.
They will not harm you except for a harm, and if they fight against you they will turn their backs, then they will not be helped.
They shall be pitched on a rope of the wrath of God, as they were pitched on a rope of wrath, and they incurred the wrath of Allah, and there is pitched upon them and destitution. That is because they disbelieved in the signs of Allah and slew the prophets unjustly. That is because they disobeyed the signs of Allah.
These are not alike. Of the People of the Book are a community, who recite the revelations of God, in the hours of the night, prostrating themselves.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin good deeds, and forbid dishonour, and vie to hasten the good. These are the righteous.
And whatever they do good, they shall not be recognized by it; and Allah knows the pious.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah. They are the inmates of the Fire; therein they shall abide forever.
The example of that which they spend in the life of this world is as a likeness of a biting wind which smites the harvest of a people who wronged themselves; and Allah wronged them, and Allah does not wrong them.
O you who have believed, do not take your confidants as intimates, as they do not spare you. They do not spare you to see themselves. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal. Indeed We have made clear to you the signs, if you understand not.
It is you who love them, and they do not love you, and you believe in the Book. When they meet you, they say, “We believe”; and when they meet their fingers, they bite their fingers in rage. Say, “Die in your rage!” Allah knows what is in the breasts.
And if good befalls you, it grieves them; and if some misfortune befalls you, they rejoice at it. But if you persevere, their guile will never avail you. God encompasses what they do.
And remember when you went forth to your family in the home of the believers, in the battle to the believers, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
When two parties among you were about to lose courage, and Allah is their Protector; and in Allah let the believers rely.
God has already helped you at Badr when you were contemptible in battle. So fear God, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, “Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?”
Yes, if you are patient and cautious, and they will come to you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels marked.
And Allah did not send it as a good news to you, and that your hearts may be comforted. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
That He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve, or suppress them, so that they may turn away.
It is no concern of you whether He redeems them or punishes them or punishes them with the punishment.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled, and fear Allah, that ye may prosper.
And fear the Fire which is prepared for those who disbelieve.
And obey Allah and the Messenger, so that you may receive mercy.
And hasten with forgiveness from your Lord and the Garden of Paradise, as as as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.
Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah, and those who are in their hearts, and restrain their sins; and Allah loves the pious.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives sins, and do not know Allah? And they do not know the truth.
Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Excellent is the reward of the workers.
Many eras have passed before you, and travel in the earth. Behold, how was the end of those who deny the truth.
This is a reminder for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for the pious.
And do not grieve, nor grieve, nor grieve, if you are believers.
If a wound afflicts you, a similar wound has touched the people who have gone away, so that Allah may make those who are believers, so that Allah may know those who believe and make others martyrs. God does not love the wrongdoers.
And that Allah may purge those who believe and do not believe in the truth.
Do you think that you do not think that God has not shown those who do not believe in the cause of Allah, and who are patient?
And indeed you were longing for death before you encountered death, and you did not see when you were beholding.
Muhammad is not but a Messenger. Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is slain, will you turn back on your heels. He who turns back on his heels will not harm God. God will reward the thankful.
No soul can die except by Allah's command. Whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him to him; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We shall give him his reward; and We will reward the grateful.
And many of the Prophets have fought by the number of godly people who fought, and they fainted not in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken; and Allah loves the steadfast.
And they did not say: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and our extravagance in our affairs, and make our feet firm, and give us victory against the unbelievers."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter; and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will be losers.
But Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they have associated partners with Allah, for which He has not sent down any authority. Their abode is the Fire; and the evil destination is the evil-doers.
God has promised your promise to you, so that they were made to make you slip into the land, and when you were disputing, then your hearts were much suspicious of you, and you disbelieved in the matter of Allah, and then He turned you to account of some of you, and He makes you taste the life of the world, and He may test you, and He will test you, and He will forgive you, and Allah is the faithful of the believers.
And when you were guilty of the side of your side, and the Noble Messenger came to you, so he was calling to you, so that you may sorrow with your sorrow, so that you may not grieve with what you have earned. And Allah is aware of what you do.
Then, when He sent you a mount for you, He sent down the angels, and there was a group of you who were afraid of them, and they said, “We have not been any intercessors.” And they said, “We could not be able to intercede for us.” Say, “We have no knowledge of what you say.” Say, “We have no knowledge of what you say.” Say, “In the earth, you have no knowledge of what you have no knowledge.” Say, “In the earth, if you are in your houses.” Say, “In the earth, it is they who are the people of the hearts.”
Those on you who turned back on the Day of Judgment, when the two armies were made to appear to them. But Allah has pardoned them for some of them. God is All-forgiving and All-forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when they meet their brethren, their brothers, go forth in the land, or say, “Had we were with us, they would not have died, nor were they killed.” Allah will think that Allah will cause their hearts in their hearts, and He gives life to death; and Allah sees what you do.
And if you are killed in the way of Allah or die, forgiveness of Allah and forgiveness is better than them.
And if you die or die, then surely you will be mustered.
It is for Allah's grace to you, and you were harsh, and if you were harsh, they would surely have gone away from you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them, and consult your affairs; then when you repent, put your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, then He will help you? In Allah let the believers rely.
It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent, but whoever defrauds will act unfaithfully to his fraud on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul shall be repaid for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the good pleasure of Allah like him who is laden to the wrath of Allah, and whose refuge is Hell? And he is the destination.
They are in ranks, and Allah sees what they do.
Indeed Allah has sent a great favour upon the believers, when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom, and that they were in manifest error.
And when you had suffered it with you, when you had inflicted twice twice, you said, “Is this?” Say, “It is your own selves.” Indeed, Allah has power over all things.
And what befell you on the day of the two armies, the command of Allah, and that He may test the believers.
And that He may know the hypocrites, and when it was said to them, “Come, fight in the way of Allah,” they said, “Had we knew that we would surely have followed you.” They were nearer to unbelief, and they were nearer to the believers, saying to their mouths. God knows what they do.
Those who were among their brethren, when they were sitting, said, "Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed." Say, "Avert death, if you are truthful."
Think not those who are slain in the way of Allah as dead. Nay, they are alive and sustenance from their Lord.
Rejoicing in that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of His grace, and those who have not joined them, and those who have not joined them, that they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in the grace of Allah and His grace, and Allah does not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to Allah and His Messenger, and the Messenger, and those who have done righteous deeds, shall have a great reward.
Those to whom the people said: "Surely, the people have gathered against you, so fear them." But it increased them in their faith, and they said: Allah is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best of the righteous.
So they returned from Allah’s grace and bounty, untouched to be followed them, and they followed the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is Extremely Munificent.
That is only Satan frightening the partisans of Satan. So fear them not, and fear Me, if you are believers.
And do not grieve for those who deny the truth, so they will not be able to harm Allah. Allah intends to punish them in the Hereafter, and there awaits them a great punishment.
Those who purchase faith in exchange of disbelief, they shall not harm Allah in the least, and theirs will be a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that We give them respite for a good term; but We only give them respite for them, and they will have a humiliating punishment.
It is not for Allah's decree to you that you may believe in the believers, until He separates the good from the good. And Allah does not know the secrets of the unseen, and Allah chooses His apostles. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and if you believe and fear Him, you will have a great reward.
And let not those who think that which Allah has bestowed upon them of His grace, think that it is good for them. Nay, it is worse for them; nay, they shall be niggardly for what they have earned. And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is aware of what you do.
Allah has heard the saying of those who say: "Allah is poor, and we are rich." We shall write down what they have said, and their slaying of the prophets unjustly, and We shall say: "Taste the torment of the burning."
This is because of what your hands have sent, and Allah is not unjust to His servants.
Those who say: Allah hath not covenanted to us a messenger, until we believe not until he bring us a offering of food, which shall devour the fire. Say: 'Messengers come to you with clear proofs, and some of what you say, and what you say is true?"
But if they deny you, [O Muhammad], were also messengers before you, who came to them with clear signs, and the Psalms and the Illuminating Book.
Every soul shall taste death, and you will be repaid to the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is removed from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he will be admitted to Paradise. The life of this world is nothing but the enjoyment of delusion.
You will surely be tested in your possessions and your lives, and those who have been given the Book before you, and those who have been given the Book before you. But if you are patient and fear Allah, it is indeed the steadiest of courses.
And recall when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book, that he may make clear people to the people, and not hide it, and they threw it behind their backs and sold it for a paltry price, so that they took a small price.
Think not that those who exult in what they have been concealing, and do not be praised for what they have not done. They do not expect the punishment. For them is a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God has power over all things.
Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, are signs for a people who understand.
Those who remember Allah standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, and say: "Our Lord! You have not created this without vain. Glory be to You! Save us from the torment of the Fire.
Our Lord, admit us the fire of the Fire, and do not disgrace the unjust.”
Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling to faith, saying: Believe in your Lord, and believe in Him. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and forgive us our sins, and make us die with the righteous.
Our Lord, give us what You have promised us with Your apostles, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You do not break Your promise."
Then his Lord said to his Lord, "I am not of your mother, or a female, or the other among you, except for those who have been forbidden to you, and were expelled from the house of your house, and he has been banished to them, and I will admit them to the Gardens of which rivers flow, and he will have a reward from Allah; and Allah is with the best.”
Do not be deluded in the land, and let the disbelievers deceive you.
It is but a brief enjoyment; and their abode is Hell, and wretched is the resting place.
But as for those who fear their Lord, for them will be Gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever; this is the reward of Allah; and with Allah is the best.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed to them, and do not sell God’s revelations for a paltry price. These are their reward with their Lord. God is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! Be patient, be patient, and be steadfast, and fear Allah, that you may prosper.
O mankind! Fear your Lord. Who created you from a single soul, and from it He created, and from the earth, and from them, and women, and women, and fear of you, and fear Allah. Verily Allah is over you a Warden.
And give the orphans their property, and do not exchange the good, and do not consume your property with your property; indeed it is a great sin.
And if you fear that you will not be able to act justly fairly, then marry the women among your women, or marry four other four, or if you are unable to do justice, do not be able to treat them, or if you are able to do justice, it is likelier that you may not be partial.
And give the women their dowries, handing their gift. But if they forego you with some of it, consume it with wholesome appetite.
And do not give the property of your wealth that Allah has appointed for you, and make a provision for you, and feed them, and speak to them words of appropriate words.
And wed the orphans until they reach the age of marriage; then when you find them in the age of marriage, then give them their property, and hastily is not afraid of spending and hastily. And if the soul is poor, he is poor for him. And if you give them to their own accord, then give them to their own poor. And if you give them to their own accord, you will be witnesses with them. God is sufficient as a Reckoner.
Men shall be given a share of what parents parents and parents, and what parents parents, and what is related to parents, or a share of what parents, or the women, or the legal women.
And when the division of the division of the orphans and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and speak to them, speak to them.
And let those who are concerned for them who die in their own children, then let them fear of their own hands; then fear Allah, and speak to them the right word.
Those who consume the property of the orphans, consume their bellies in their bellies, in their bellies they will roast in Hell.
He has given your parents to you as daughters of marriage, and if you marry two of their women daughters, then if you are two of their women, then he is a child, and if you are able to bring a man, he would have a share of their mother. And if you are a child, then he would be a child. And if you are a child, he would take his parents. And Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.
And give your wives for your women, and if you have given a term of marriage, then if they have no offspring, he would bring you a share of what he has entrusted to you. And if you are entitled to a child, he would have taken a part of them for you, and if you have a thousand of them, he would have taken a part of their wives. And if you are a child, he would have taken a part of them. And if you are a child, he would have taken a part of them. And if a man or a child, he would have a share of a man, and a man, or a child. Such is the law of God.
These are the limits of Allah; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever. That is the supreme triumph.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will make him enter the Fire in which he will abide; and there awaits them a humiliating chastisement.
And if any of your women are guilty of lewdness, let four witnesses against them, and if they bear witness, confine them to their houses until death takes them, or Allah will not guide them for a way.
As for those among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, punish them, and if they repent, let them leave them. God is All-clement, All-compassionate.
Only those who repent in the way of Allah, then repent thereafter, then repent to Allah. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And repentance is not for those who do evil deeds, until when death comes to one of them, he says, “I repent”; and those who die are faithless, We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women, nor will they be allowed to make a part of that which they have given them, so that you may be guilty of what you have given them. Live with them, if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike it, and if you dislike them, you will not be disliking what you dislike.
And if you want to replace one another with one another, then do not be given a dower to you, then take it back to you, if you do not take it back to you, unless you take a clear calumny.
And how can you take a single soul when you have gone away from you, and you have taken a solemn covenant?
And wed not women women whom your fathers married, except that which hath already been decreed. Lo! it is an abomination and an evil wrong.
You are your wives, your wives, and your children, and your children, and your hair, and your hair, and your hair, and the hair, and your women, and your women, and your women, and the women of your mothers, and you are your mothers, and your wives are the marriage of marriage. And if you are with their wives, you would not be able to be blamed. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
And the wives of your wives are not lawful for you, except that which Allah has ordained for you. And if you are unable to do so, it is not lawful for you except that you may not be reconciled to them. And do not take your hands as a few of you, except for a few appointed, and as for the appointed time, you would not be blamed. God is All-knowing, All-wise.
And wed not the women or the women who are married of your wives, and the women who are not among you. And Allah hath endeared you with the believers, and of those who are not fit with you. And when ye give your fathers, give them a part of that of which they are married. And afterward not be of those who are allowed to do, and do not give their wives honourably. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah wishes to make clear to you, and to show you to the ways of those who have gone before you, and to turn towards you. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And Allah desires to forgive you from His mercy; and those who follow their own desires are far away from it.
Allah desires to lighten your affair, and man is created weak.
O you who have believed, do not consume the property of your own soul, except by the trade of your agreeing, and do not kill yourselves; indeed Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
And whoever commits a wrong-deed and does wrong wrong, We shall roast him into the Fire. That is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden, We shall acquit you from your sins, and admit you to a noble Entrance.
Do not covet what Allah has given some of you among others. To men are a share of what they have earned, and for the women a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah from His bounty. God has knowledge of all things.
We have appointed heirs to the relatives and your relatives, and those who are with you, and those who have taken with you their share. God is Witness over all things.
The women are the heirs of the heritage of Allah. He has preferred them of some of them, and spend for their wealth. As for those who are Godwary, they are pious, and those who are Godwary, so that Allah may protect them. And those who are wary of you are wary of them. But if you obey them, then do not seek the way of God. Indeed, Allah is All-Strong, All-Powerful.
And if you fear a breach between a woman, and appoint a arbiter from his family, and a man from his family. If they desire to reconcile Allah, Allah will make them together. God is All-knowing, All-aware.
Worship Allah and do not associate any partners with Him, and to parents, and to relatives, and the needy, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the neighbour, the companion, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer.
Those who are niggardly, and bid others to be niggardly, and hide what Allah has bestowed upon them of His grace. We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, and do not believe in Allah and in the Last Day; and whoever takes the companion of Satan, he is an evil companion.
What would they believe if they believe in Allah and the Last Day, and spent of what Allah has bestowed upon them, and Allah knows best what they have spent.
Indeed, Allah does not wrong the weight of the atom's weight, but if He wills, He doubles it, and gives a great reward.
How will it be, when We bring a witness from every nation, and We bring you a witness against you?
On that Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were made the earth, and they will not be able to hide God.
O you who have believed, do not approach your prayers until you are intoxicated until you know what you know, and you know the Sacred Mosque. And if you are on a journey or on a journey, then you are sick, or if you are sick, you will find it, and you will find a light, and your hands will find you, and your hands will find you, and Allah is Forgiving, Forgiving.
Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book? They purchased error, and wish to lead you astray from the way?
Allah knows your enemies. God suffices as a protector and Helper.
And some of the People of the Book have been given in the ground, in order that he may make some of them, and say, “Be this,’ and the word of your hearts testified to the truth, and they say, “If we were guided, we are too, and some of the people who have been given, and some of them have deviated.” They have incurred a great punishment.
O People of the Book! Believe that which We have sent down to you, confirming what is revealed to you, and turn away from them, and curse them, or curse them. And Allah's command is the matter.
Indeed Allah does not forgive association with Him, and He forgives whom He wills. And whoever ascribes partners with Allah, he has indeed fabricated a tremendous sin.
Have you not seen those who assert themselves? Rather, Allah purifies whomever He wills, and they will not be wronged.
See how they invent lies against Allah, and that is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book? They disbelieve in superstition and Taghut, and say to the unbelievers, “These are better than the believers.”
Those are they whom Allah has cursed; and whomever Allah curses, you will find no helper for him.
Or have they a share of the Kingdom? Then, when they were given a people, they will not be able to give a date-stone.
Or do they envy some men that Allah has bestowed upon them of His grace? We gave Abraham the Book and the Book, and We gave them a great kingdom.
And of them are those who believe in it, and of them are some who have turned away from it, and it is a blazing fire for them.
Those who disbelieve in Our signs, We shall roast them into the Fire. As often as their skins are cooked, We shall replace them for their skins; surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever; and We shall admit them to spouses and admit them into the middle path.
Indeed Allah commands you to render to your owners, and when you judge between people, judge between justice. God advises what you do.
O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and obey the Messenger. But if you dispute in the matter of Allah, then believe in the Day of Judgment, refer to Allah and His Messenger. That is the best determination.
Have you not seen those who assert that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They desire to worship the judgement of Allah, though they were commanded to deny him, and the Shaitan desires to lead them astray far astray.
And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down, and the Messenger,” and you see the hypocrites shunning you,
So how, when they are afflicted with a misfortune of what their hands have forwarded, then they come to you swearing by Allah, "We wish only only the good and conciliation."
These are the ones in whose hearts Allah knows what is in their hearts. So ignore them and admonish them, and say to them penetrating words.
And We sent not the messenger to be obeyed to be obeyed by Allah's leave; and when they were wronged, then when they had wronged themselves, they would have prayed to Allah and the Messenger, and the Messenger had forgiveness for forgiveness for them, they would not have found Allah the Turner, the Merciful.
But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they are believers, so that you may judge between them in the matter of their disputes, then do not find them in their hearts, in order that they may not find their hearts, in order that they are believers.
And if We had decreed them, [O Muhammad], or leave your homes, or leave your homes for a few of them, they would not have done it. But if they had done what they had done, it would have been better for them.
And We will have granted them from Us a great reward.
and guided them on the Straight Path.
And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, those who have been blessed, those who have been blessed, the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, and the righteous.
This is the bounty of Allah. Allah is All-knowing and All-knowing.
O you who believe! Take your precautions, then go forth in companies, or go forth in groups.
There are some of you who lag behind, but if a misfortune befalls you, he says, “God has favored me.”
And if a bounty from Allah comes to you, he would be sure as if there were no affection between you and him, “Would that I had been given me, I would surely have achieved a great success.”
So let those who sell the way of Allah, for the life of this world, and whoever fights in the way of Allah, We shall surely give him a great reward in the life of the world, or whether he is a great reward.
And what is the matter with you, that you do not fight in the way of Allah, and the oppressed men, and children, and children, who say, “Our Lord, bring us out of this town in this town, and bring us a protector from Yourself, and appoint for us from Yourself a helper.”
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Allah. So fight the friends of Satan. Indeed, the strategy of Satan is weak.
Have you not seen those who were concerned to your parents, and pay the alms, and pay the alms, and pay the alms, so that the earthquake of them were mentioned against them, so that the people of the town would say, “Our Lord, why do you have been destroyed against us?” And they will say, “Our Lord!” And when you say, “Our Lord is the Best of us.” And they will say, “Our Lord, give us a little, and the Hereafter.”
Wherever you may see death, you will see, though you are in fortified towers. But if good befalls them, they say, “This is from Allah.” But if a misfortune befalls them, they say, “This is from Allah.” Say, “All is the God, the Lord of this people?”
Whatever good happens to you is from Allah; and whatever misfortune befalls you, it is from your own souls; and We have sent you as a Messenger, and Allah suffices as a witness.
Whoever obeys the Messenger obeys Allah; and whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a keeper.
They say, "Obedience," and when they come to you, a group of them say to you by night. But Allah records what they plan by night. So turn away from them, and put your trust in Allah. God suffices as trustee.
Do they not ponder to the Qur’an? Had it been other than the other, they would still have been found in it.
And when there comes to them a news of security, they fear it, and when they had referred it to the Messenger, they would surely have followed it. And if they had referred to the Messenger, it would have been revealed to them. But Allah would not have mercy for you, except for a few, and if Allah had mercy, you would have followed the few.
So fight in the way of Allah; you are not responsible for yourself; and rouse the believers, and fight that Allah will restrain the disbelievers. Allah is Strong and Severe.
Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share of it, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will find it for a burden; and Allah is over all things competent.
When you are greeted with a greeting, greet with one another, or return to it. God is swift over all things.
Allah! There is no god but He; He gathereth you on the Day of Resurrection, wherein there is no doubt; and who is truer in speech than Allah.
And what are the matter with you that you are two parties regarding the hypocrites, and Allah has reverted them for their misdeeds? Do you want to guide him? God leads astray whom He wishes, and no one will find him astray.
They wish that you should disbelieve like those who disbelieve, so that they are unbelievers. So do not befriend them for the allies they emigrate in the way of Allah; then if they turn back, seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any friend or helper among them.
Except those who are with you, who are a treaty, and among you is a treaty, or when you fight to fight with you, fight from their own people. Had Allah willed, He would have given you power over you. If they turn away from you, they would not fight you, and if they turn away from you, then they will not fight you, and Allah does not guide you for a way.
There is no one who will find you to go out from you in security, and from their own people. Whenever they are angry, they rejoice in it, and if they turn away from you, they will not be able to offer you peace, and kill them wherever you find them, and kill them wherever you find them, and kill them wherever you have been given.
And let not those who believe find the way of the believers, and the faithful, and the faithful who are a Muslim of the faithful, and he has been made a slave, and He has made his affairs narrow. And if you are guilty of the religion of the believers, he will be more for the believers; and if you are guilty of the religion of the believers, then there is no expiation for you. And if you are the people of the past, then there is He who is the one of the believers.
And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his reward is Hell, and he is the fire of hell; and Allah has cursed him and has prepared for him a painful punishment.
O you who believe! When you are told in the cause of Allah, investigate, and say, "Do not speak to you." You say: 'You are not believers." But the life of the life of this world are greater for you. But Allah has bestowed favor upon you, and Allah has bestowed upon you His grace, and then, Allah is Aware of what you do.
The believers are not equal to those who are disabled, unless they are disabled in the way of Allah, and those who strive not in the way of Allah with their possessions and their lives. Allah has preferred those who strive with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah; and Allah has preferred them with the holdersback.
Ranks from Him and mercy and mercy. Allah is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
As for those who are wronging themselves, the angels will say to the angels, “What did you think?’ They will say, “We will surely be able to cause the earth.” They will say, “Was not Allah’s earth is spacious for you?” Their refuge will be hell; and wretched is the destination.
Except for the weak, men, men, men, and children, unable to find any change to them.
Surely Allah will pardon them. Allah is All-forgiving and All-forgiving.
He who emigrates in the way of Allah will find refuge in refuge in the earth and in the refuge of refuge, and he who goes on his house in the way of Allah and His Messenger, and his death is on his death. Allah is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
And when you travel in the land, then fear that you are in the journey, so that you may be able to disbelieve in it. Indeed, the disbelievers are your enemies.
And when you came to them, and set a group of them, and let them go back to them. And when they commanded them, they would not be divided with one another. And when they were commanded with you, they would not be able to adopt the religion of one another, and they will turn back to you in the way of the believers, and they will plead for their own tongues. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.
So when you have finished the prayer, remember Allah, standing, sitting, and lying on your sides. Remember, when you are secure, perform the prayer in prayer. Indeed, the prayer of the believers is a timed time.
And do not slacken in the pursuit of the enemy. If you are suffering, they are aching, and you hope that they may not expect it. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) to the truth, so that you may judge between mankind by the matter of Allah, and do not be successful.”
And seek forgiveness from Allah; surely Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.
And do not plead on behalf of those who deceive themselves; indeed Allah does not like the treacherous.
They hide themselves from men, and they cannot hide themselves from Allah. But when they hide themselves by night, Allah will approve them. God encompasses what they do.
Ah! you are those who pleaded in the life of this world; and who will argue on the Day of Resurrection on their behalf of Allah and on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be their defender?
And whoever does evil or wrongs his own soul and then seeks forgiveness from Allah, then Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And whoever commits an sin, earns it for his own soul; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And whoever earns a sin or a sin, then then blames it, then he who has burdened a slander and a manifest sin.
And were it not for Allah's grace upon you and His mercy, a party of them would have resolved to lead you astray, but they would not hurt you. And Allah has sent down to you the Book and taught you the Book and taught you what you did not know. And Allah is with the great bounty.
There is no good in their secret talks in secret, except that he enjoins charity, or reconciliation between men. And whoever does good, seeking the pleasure of Allah, seeking him to be a great reward.
And whoever opposeth the Messenger after the clear guidance has been manifested to him, and follows the way of the believers, We shall make him him, and We shall cast him into hell, and it is an evil destination.
Indeed Allah does not forgive association with Him, and He forgives whom He wills; and whoever associates partners with Allah, he is far astray.
They invoke none but worship of Him, and they do not invoke except the rebellious Satan.
Allah has cursed him. He said, "I will take for Your servants a share of Your servants."
And I will lead them astray and I will lead them astray, and I will prompt them to slit the slit-slit-slit-ears, and I will prompt them to slit the ears of the cattle, and I will command them, and I will command them. And whoever takes Allah as a friend, he is a manifest loss.”
He promises them and fills them with their own desires; and Satan promises them not.
Their refuge will be the Fire, and they will find no asylum from it.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever. God's promise is true.
It is not your fancies nor the fancies of the People of the Book. Whoever commits an evil deed will be recompensed for it, and none will find God for no protector or helper.
And whoever does good deeds, whether male or female, and is a believer, shall be admitted to Paradise, and they shall not be wronged.
And who is better in religion than he who submits his face to Allah, and is a doer of good, and follows the religion of Ibrahim? And Allah was the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth; and Allah encompasses all things.
Say (O Muhammad SAW) concerning them (O Muhammad SAW). Say: "Allah will judge to you, and that you may know that which you have given them (in the Oneness of Allah), and that which is recited to you (in the Oneness of Allah)." As for those who are true (in the Book), it is not for those who are concerned to the truth (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] of which they have been given them. And do not give them their wealth, and give the poor to you. And whatever you do good, Allah is All-knowing of what you do.
And if a woman fears her husband or desertion from her husband, then there is no sin between them. And if they forego reconciliation between reconciliation, it is no sin in it. And if you do good, then Allah is Aware of what you do.
And you will not be able to be equitable between your wives, even though you are eager. So do not incline to one another, and do not incline to one another. And if you are conciliatory, then Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.
But if they separate, Allah will enrich out of His grace. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Wise.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth. And We have been charged to you (O Muhammad SAW) and those who have been given the Book before you. So fear Allah, and if you disbelieve, know all that is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Allah is Rich and Praiseworthy.
And Allah's is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee.
If He wills, He could take you away, and bring others, and Allah is Able to do all things.
Whoever desires the reward of this world, for him is the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
O you who believe! Be maintainers of justice, bearers of justice, witnesses yourselves against yourselves. Whether you are guilty of your parents or be nearer to the poor or poor is poor, Allah will be more for you. Do not follow the desires of your desires, if you swerve or turn away, then Allah is aware of what you do.
O you who believe, believe in God and His Messenger, and the Book He sent down to His Messenger, and the Book which He sent down before him. Whoever disbelieves in God and His angels, His Books, His Books, and the Last Day, has gone far astray.
Those who believe, then then disbelieve, then then disbelieve, and then disbelieve, and then disbelieve, and disbelieve, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to a path.
Give glad tidings to the hypocrites that for them is a painful punishment.
Those who take the believers as allies instead of the believers. Do they seek honor from them? All glory belongs to God.
Indeed Allah has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah, and do not sit away with them, they do not fight with them until they engage with one another. Indeed, Allah will gather the hypocrites and those who deny the truth.
Those who wait with you, and if Allah comes to victory for you, they say: 'Were you not with us, or if the unbelievers are the unbelievers, they would not have been able to do you." And Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection.
And the hypocrites think that they are Allah's cause, and Allah has only to them, and when they stand up to prayer, they stand up to the people, and they are not remembering by Allah’s remembrance.
wavering between them, neither to their religion, nor to those who go astray, and whomsoever Allah leads astray, you will find no way for him.
O you who believe! Do not befriend those who believe, rather than the believers. Do you think that God should make clear clear to you?
The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire, and you will find no helper for them.
Except those who repent and amend, and hold fast to Allah, and hold fast to Allah, they are the believers; and Allah will give the believers a great reward.
Why should Allah punish you if you believe and do you believe? Allah is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Allah does not like any one of the shouting of good speech. God is All-hearing and All-knowing.
Whether you do good openly openly, or conceal it, or pardon evil, Allah is Pardoning and Competent.
Those who disbelieve in Allah and His apostles, and seek to differentiate between Allah and His apostles, and say: 'We believe in the signs of Allah, and disbelieve for them, and seek for them a way."
Those are they who disbelieve in the truth; and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
And those who believe in Allah and His apostles and do not differentiate between any of them, He will give them their reward; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The People of the Book ask you to bring down to them a Book from heaven. But they asked Moses greater than the other. They said: "Show us Allah." So the thunderbolt struck them for their sins, but they took their calf for a calf. And when they had come to the calf, they would surely have done a clear authority.
And We raised the Mount above them above them, and We said to them, “Enter the gate prostrating with humility”; and We said to them, “Do not violate the Sabbath,’ and We took upon them a solemn covenant.
So for their breaking their covenant, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and they said: Our hearts are hardened. Nay! Allah hath sealed their hearts for them, so that they may not believe.
And for their faithlessness, and the uttering of Mary, a monstrous calumny.
And because of their saying, “We killed the Messiah, son of Mary, son of Mary, son of Mary, son of Mary, and did not crucify him, nor crucified him.’ And those who differ concerning them are about in doubt concerning it; and they were not aware of it, but they were not aware.
But Allah raised him to Himself, and Allah is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
There is no one of the People of the Book but will believe in him before his death. On the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.
And of the evildoing of the Jews, We forbade them the good things of the good things which had been forbidden to them, and they have barred them from the way of Allah.
And as for those who were taking them, and they were prohibited from what they were forbidden, and consuming the people of the wealth of Allah, and We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
But those among them who believe in the knowledge, and believe in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed before you, and what was revealed before you, and pay the poor-rate, and believe in Allah and the Last Day; We shall give them a great reward.
We have revealed to you (O Muhammad SAW) as a revelation (Noah) and Noah (Noah) and Noah (Noah), and We revealed to him (Abraham), and to Ibrahim, and Ishaq, and Ishaq, and Ishaq, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Ayub, and Jonah, and Jonah and Sulaiman, and We gave the Psalms.
And We have already sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW), and We have not related to you (O Muhammad SAW), and We have not related to you (O Muhammad SAW), and Allah spoke to Musa (O Muhammad SAW).
Messengers and glad tidings to the people of the Messenger, and to warn the people after the people of God. God is Majestic and All-wise.
He bears witness to what He has revealed to you, and He has sent down His knowledge. And the angels bear witness, and Allah suffices witness.
Verily those who disbelieve and hinder the way of Allah from the way of the way of Allah, has strayed far astray.
Surely those who disbelieve and do wrong deeds, Allah will not guide them nor guide them to a way.
Except the way of hell, to abide therein forever. And that is easy for Allah.
O mankind! The Messenger has come to you the truth from your Lord. So believe in it, and if you disbelieve, Allah will know all that is in the heavens and the earth. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
O People of the Book! Do not make mischief in the way of Allah, nor do the religion of Allah. Say, "The son of Mary is the son of Mary, and His Messenger, and the angels, and a light from Him. It is not a light from Him. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and do not ask Him. God is the Guardian of all that is in the heavens and the earth. God is the Guardian of all things.
The Messiah disdaineth not the servant of Allah, nor the angels, nor the angels; and whoever disdaineth stiff-necked and stiff-necked, He shall gather them together.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, He will pay them their reward, and He will give them out of His grace; and they are proud and proud.
O mankind! Verily there hath come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.
Then as for those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy and mercy, and He will guide them to His mercy, and He will guide them to the Straight Path.
(Muhammad), tell them, "God will tell you about the case of Judgment." Say, "Allah will inform you of your people, if they have no female, or he is a child." And if they had a female, he would have given his brother as a child. And if they were a child, he would have put their wives as a child, and if they were a child, then some of the two of their mother are two months. God does not think that which is in the past. God has knowledge of all things.
O you who believe! fulfill your obligations. Lawful to you except that which is recited to you, except that which is recited to you, game in the chase. Allah creates what He wills.
O you who have believed, do not consume the bounds of God’s revelations, and the Sacred Mosque, and the Sacred Mosque, and the Sacred Month, and the trees, and the emigrants, and the Sacred Mosque; and the Holy Mosque, and the Holy Mosque, and the Holy Mosque, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer; and Allah is severe in retribution.
It is He who created you, and blood, and blood, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of the other, and the other, and the other, and the flesh of the other, and the flesh of the other, and the flesh of the other, and the dead, and the flesh of the dead, and you eat the flesh of the other, and He brought you forth, so that you may be compelled to Him. And Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.
They ask you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) for what they have provided them. Say: 'This is lawful for you, and you have made it known to the people, and that which you have taught by Allah has been taught you, so that you may eat what Allah has taught you, and that you may eat Allah, and Allah is swift in reckoning.”
This is lawful for you (O Muhammad SAW) and the food (of food), and the cattle, and the cattle, and the cattle, and the wayfarer, and the women, and the women, and the women, and the women who were not related to you. And do not obey the people who have been given you, and do not make unlawful to them a few. And whoever disbelieves in the Oneness of Allah, then indeed, he is in the Hereafter.
O you who believe! When you meet the prayer, then turn away from your hands, and extend your hands into your feet, and make your feet and feet and your feet, and you are tender in your place, and if you are given a journey, then you have bathed it, and if you find a journey, then you will find it, then you will find it, or you will find it, or you will find it, or you will find it, and Allah will give you out of your hands; and Allah has pardoned you, so that you may be grateful.
Remember Allah’s blessing upon you and His covenant which He bound with you, when you said, "We hear and we obey. Have fear of God. Indeed Allah knows all that is in the breasts.
O you who believe! Be maintainers of justice, bearers of justice, and do not let the hatred of your people deviate you, and do not make the people to be unfair. That is nearer to piety; and fear Allah. God is aware of what you do.
Allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds, for them is forgiveness and a great reward.
As for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the inmates of hell.
O you who have believed, remember Allah’s favour upon you when the people intended to extend their hands, and He withheld their hands from you, and fear Allah; and Allah is the faithful, the believers.
And Allah took a covenant from the Children of Israel and made them twelve of their descendants. He said: "I am with you, if you are patient, and pay the poor-rate, and if you obey My Messengers and give them a goodly loan to Allah, I will surely acquit you of your sins, and I will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow. Then whoever turns away from you, then indeed, you are astray of the truth.
So because of their breaking their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts hard, so that they had forgotten the words of their homes, and those who were reminded of what they had been reminded of. And so, the few among them would not be divided by a few of them. And pardon them and overlook them; and Allah loves the righteous.
And as for those who say, "We are Christians' We took a covenant from them, and they forgot a portion of what they were reminded of, and enmity between them and the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will inform them of what they did.
O people of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you the truth, revealing to you much of what you used to hide in the Book, and overlooking much. There has come to you from God a light and a clear Book.
It is He who guides the ways of peace to you and His mercy, and He brings them out of darkness into light, and guides them to the Straight Path.
They are those who say, “God is the Messiah, son of Mary, son of Mary.” Say, “Should Allah willed to the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and his mother, and his mother, and everyone on earth?” To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them. He creates whatever He wills, and He has power over all things.
The Jews and the Christians say: "We are the sons of Allah and His beloved." Say: "Why then does He punish you for your sins? Nay, you are mortals but mortals, He forgives whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is the return.
O People of the Book! There has come to you Our Messenger, until there came to you an Messenger, that you may say, “Do not give us a bearer of glad tidings to the Noble Messenger?” There has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner; and Allah has power over all things.
And when Moses said to his people: O my people! Remember Allah's favour upon you when He raised prophets among you and made you kings, and He gave you no one of the worlds.
“O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah has assigned for you, and do not turn back, and turn back to your heels.”
They said: O Musa! verily there is a great multitude in a city; and we shall not enter it until they leave it; then if they go back, we shall surely be of the winners.
Two one of those who feared God, and whom Allah had bestowed upon them, said, "Enter the gate, if you are victorious, you will be victorious. Put your trust in God, if you are believers."
They said, “O Moses, we will never enter it until they are in it; and your Lord and your Lord, and fight you; we are sitting sitting.”
He said: "O my Lord! I have no power over myself and my brother, so decide between us from the rebellious people."
(Allah) said: "It will be said to them for forty years for forty years, in order to wander in the earth. So do not grieve for the people of criminals."
Recite to them the tale of the two sons of Adam. When they offered a sacrifice, it was accepted from one of them, but he accepted from the other. He said, "I will surely kill you." He said, "God accepts the righteous."
If you extend your brother to kill me, I will not extend your hand to kill you, for I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
“Indeed, I desire that you should bear my sin and your sin, and you will be among the inmates of the Fire; and this is the reward of the wrongdoers.”
So his soul prompted him to kill his brother, and he killed him, and he became one of the losers.
Then Allah sent a crow scratching on the ground, so that he might show him to his brother's corpse. He said, "Woe to me! Am I not like this crow to be so that I could be able to hide the corpse of my brother?" And he was one of his brother.
To the Children of Israel, for the Children of Israel, who kills a soul to be killed in the land, as if he killed to commit corruption in the earth, he would be killed as though he had killed mankind. And whoever saves him, it is as though he had saved all mankind. Our messengers came to them with clear proofs, but many of them were transgressors.
Those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, and fight in the land, in order that they shall be killed or crucified, or be slain from their hands and their feet, and their feet, or their feet, or their feet, and their feet is in the life of this world; and in the Hereafter is a great punishment.
Except for those who repent after you repent, and know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! Be wary of Allah, and seek a means of access to Him, and strive hard in His way.
Indeed, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much as it had been offered to them, they would not be accepted from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, nor will they be accepted.
They will get out from the Fire, but they will not come to it, and theirs will be a lasting punishment.
As for the thief, he will be cut off for their hands, and he will be punished for their sins. God is All-Powerful, All-Wise.
But he who repents after his own deeds and reforms himself, then Allah will accept his repentance; surely Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He will and forgives whom He wills; and Allah has power over all things.
O Prophet! It is not for you to be grieved because of their disbelief. They say to those who believe, "We believe." And they are not aware of the people of the Book. And those who are in the Book say, "There is not for you." They will say, "If you are truthful, you will surely be able to be like those who have been given the Book." They will have a great punishment.
They are listeners to the unlawful, devourers of the unlawful. But if they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. And if you turn away from them, they will not harm you in the least. And if you judge between them, judge between them with justice. Indeed Allah loves those who are equitable.
And how could they come to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) when they are in the Torah, and that which is revealed to them? Then they turn away, and they are not believers.
Indeed, We have sent down the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)] and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Light of Allah (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)], and the prophets (Jews), and the prophets (Jews), and the prophets (Jews), and the rabbis (Jews) of the laws of Allah (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] were made those who were given the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah)], and those who were with the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] were the Taurat (Torah) of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)]. So do not warn Me but fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a paltry price.
And We appointed for them in the Book: life, a life of an eye, a nose for a eye, and a nose for a nose, and a tooth for a tooth, and a tooth for the tooth of it. And whoever forgoes it, then for it is he who does his reward; and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the evildoers.
And We sent upon them the son of Mary, son of Mary, confirming the Taurat, and We gave him the Gospel, the Gospel, the Gospel, the Gospel, and the confirmation of what was before it, confirming the Torah, and a guidance, and a guidance for the pious.
And let the people of the Gospel judge according to what Allah has revealed to you. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the transgressors.
And We have sent down to you the Book from the Book, and the Book which is before them; and Allah has sent down upon them the Book, and the truth, and that which is with the truth, do not follow their desires; and do not follow your desires and follow their desires; and if Allah had willed, He would have made you a community, so that you may be rightly guided. And Allah has guided you with a nation, and He has made you clear people. To Him you will all return.
And judge between them that which Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires, and beware of them lest they tempt you away from that which Allah has revealed to you. So turn away from them, and know that Allah intends to punish them for their sins; and most of mankind are transgressors.
Do they seek the judgement of the judgment of the world? But who is more better than Allah who is better in religion?
O you who believe! Do not befriend the Jews and the Christians, nor do they befriend each other; and whoever takes you takes friends of them, he is of them; indeed Allah does not guide the unjust.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease rushing to them, saying: "We fear lest a misfortune of fortune may befall us." But Allah will bring back a victory or a decision from Himself, and they will be regretful in their hearts.
And the believers will say: "Are these the men who swore by Allah their strongest oaths?" They are all that they have earned. They have lost their deeds.
O you who believe! Whoever turns away from your religion, Allah will surely send forth men as a people who love themselves, and who love those who believe, and those who believe in the way of Allah, and the disbelievers, and the believers. That is Allah’s grace; He gives whom He wills; and Allah is Ample, Knowing.
Your guardian is only Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, and the believers, and pay the alms, and bow down.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, then those who believe, verily Allah is the victorious, the Mighty.
O you who believe! Do not befriend those who have been given the Book before you, and those who have taken a mockery of you, and the unbelievers, and those who believe, if you are believers.
And when they call to prayer, they take it as a jest and fun of them. That is because they are a people who understand not.
Say: 'O People of the Book! Why do you resent us except that we believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was sent down before us? Indeed, you are most of the transgressors."
Say, “Shall I inform you of a worse punishment than the punishment of your Lord?” They were condemned by God and His wrath, and some of them were apes and swine and swine. They are worse in the worse way, and further astray from the right path.
When they come to you, they say: "We believe," and they believe in their disbelief; and Allah knows well what they conceal.
And you see many of them hastening with sin and transgression, and devour the unlawful. Evil is what they do.
Why do not forbid the rabbis and the priests forbid them and forbid the unlawful from their devouring. Evil is what they do.
And the Jews say: Allah is the pauper of their journeys, and their wives are that they were not for them. Nay, but Allah's hand is to be joined to you, so that he may be like what is revealed to you. And He has revealed to you in the way of your Lord, and He has revealed to them in the Day of Judgment, and in order that He may make them taste the people of the earth, and in order that He may make them taste the people of the earth. And Allah loveth not the Mufsidun.
Had the People of the Book believed and believed, We would certainly have redeemed their sins and admitted them into the Gardens of Paradise.
Had they were the Jews, the Gospel, and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them from their Lord, they would have been nourished from above them and from beneath their feet. Some of them are a community, and most of them do evil deeds.
O Prophet, have been revealed to what has been revealed to you from your Lord. If you do not, you would not have conveyed His message. God will protect you from the people. God does not guide the unbelievers.
Say: 'O People of the Book! Do not follow the religion of the Book, and the Gospel, and the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and do not grieve for the disbelieving people.”
Those who believe, Jews, Sabaeans, Sabaeans, Sabaeans, those who believe in God and the Last Day and do righteous deeds shall have no fear.
We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent to them Messengers. Whenever a Messenger came to them with their own desires, they would not believe, but some of the people who denied the truth.
They thought that they would not be able to harm it, but they were blind and deaf. Then Allah turned to them from His mercy; yet many of them were blind and deaf. God sees what they do.
The Messiah say, “God is the Messiah, son of Mary.” And the Messiah said, “Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever ascribes partners to Allah, the fire of the Fire, and the Fire, and the Fire, and the fire of hell. And the wrongdoers will be a helper.
They are the ones who say: "Allah is the third of the Three." There is no god but He. If they do not desist, the disbelievers will have a painful punishment.
Will they not turn to Allah and ask forgiveness for His forgiveness? Allah is All-forgiving and All-merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was naught but a Messenger, and many generations passed away before him; and his mother was a woman who ate food and they ate food. See how We explain Our signs to them, so how they are wont to see.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Why do you worship other than Allah that which you do not harm or harm of harm? And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Say: 'O People of the Book! Do not follow the religion of the Book, and do not follow the desires of the people who went astray before, and have strayed astray, and strayed astray from the right path."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of Israel and Jesus, son of Mary, and the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed their sins.
They did not forbid one another, nor did they forbid themselves from committing committing doing.
Thou wilt see many of them befriending those who disbelieve; for them is what they have earned, and the punishment of Allah is upon them, and they will abide forever.
And had they believed in Allah and the Prophet, and what was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends. But most of them are believers.
Thou wilt find the most hostile of the believers and the believers among the believers in the way of the believers, and in the cause of those who believe, and say, “We are Christians.” That are because among them are priests and monks, and they are not proud.
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears that they recognize the truth. They say, “Our Lord, we believe, so register us with the witnesses.”
And why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us, and that our Lord may admit us out of the righteous?”
God has prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever, and they will abide therein forever. That is the reward of the righteous.
As for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the inmates of hell.
O you who have believed, do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful to you, and do not transgress; indeed Allah does not like the transgressors.
Eat of what Allah has provided you, lawful and good, and fear Allah, and be wary of Him.
It is not for you that ye may not be able to bear a covenant against you, except that ye may not be able to be able to do, and that you may not be able to give your wealth in your mothers. And when you are unable to give birth to you, he will not be able to give you any one of your mothers, nor will He be able to give you a thousand months. And that you may be able to maintain a thousand months, then that you may be able to maintain the law of your oaths. Thus Allah explains His command to you that you may be grateful.
O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, gambling, and divination are abominations of Satan. Avoid them, so that you may prosper.
Satan seeks to make enmity and hatred between you and hatred of you, and to hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and the prayer, so that you will desist.
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. If you turn away, know that the duty of Our Messenger is only clear to you.
It is no sin for those who believe and do righteous deeds, that they should be cautious in what they have eaten, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and do righteous deeds, and believe, and do not believe, and fear Allah; and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! Allah will test you with the game of your game and spears, and that He may test those who fear Him in secret, and whoever fears it. And whoever transgresses after the limits that is a painful punishment.
O you who have believed, you are not in the state of ihram, when you have your multitude, and you have your blood, unless you are guilty of a train of a beast, so that it may be a single one of you. And whoever is given a poor, it is not for a man to be a means of a thousand months. And whoever does not repent, it is the same for the poor. And whoever pardons Allah, then Allah is the All-Mighty, the All-Mighty.
Lawful to you is the game of the sea, and that which is lawful for you, and for the travellers, and for the travellers, and that which is forbidden for you, in the jungle; and fear Allah; and fear of Him whom you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, the Sacred House, the Sacred month, and the sacrificial Month, and the garlands, and the garlands. That is that you know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and that Allah is Knowing of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger is only to convey the message, and Allah knows what you conceal and what you hide.
Say: "The good and the good are not equal, even though the abundance of the unclean attract you. So fear Allah, O men of understanding, that you may prosper."
O you who have believed, do not ask about things about that which Allah has revealed to you, and if you have been clear to you, they will be sent down to you; and if you ask them, they will be sent down to you. God is All-forgiving, All-clement.
A people before you asked questions before them, but they turned away in it.
Allah has not instituted the superstitions of Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah, Wasilah, Hami, Hami. Those who fabricate lies against God will be the liars. But most of them do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has revealed, and the Messenger," they reply: "Sufficient for us is our fathers." Even though their fathers had nothing nothing, they were not guided.
O you who have faith! If you are guided, he will not harm you, and whoever does you go astray, no harm to you, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
O you who believe! When you meet a part of a part of your parents, then let a two part of two of you, or if you are given a hundred, then you will be able to travel. And if you are able to travel, then you will have come to each other. God will say between them, and they will not be able to die.
And if it is discovered that both of them are guilty of the sin of the deceased, then two of them stand on two other than the two concerned of the deceased, and let two of them swear by Allah, saying: 'Our testimony is truer than our testimony, and we do not think that we shall be unjust.'
This is likelier that they will prove their testimony, so that they may bear testimony against their oaths, or be wary of their oaths. So fear Allah, and hearken, and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
On the Day when Allah will gather them all together, and say, “What is your response?” They say, “We have no knowledge. You are the All-knowing of the unseen.”
And when Allah's son was Mary, son of Mary, that I may remember Me and make your parents remember that I may take you out of the mount of the mount, and when I saved you of the angels, I shall have created the Children of Israel and settled in the earth. Then, when the Book was given to you, the Taurat and the Injil, and the Taurat and the Torah, and the knowledge of the Torah, and the Taurat, and the Taurat, and the Taurat, and the Book came to them, the truth of the truth of the truth, and the truth, and the truth, and the truth, and the truth, and the truth, and the people of the truth.
And when I revealed to the disciples, “Believe in Me and in My Messenger,” they said, “We believe, and bear witness that we are Muslims.”
And when the disciples said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord able to send down upon us a table from heaven?” He said, “Have fear of Allah, if you are believers.”
They said: We desire that we may eat of our hearts, and that our hearts may be satisfied, and we know that which thou hast promised us, and that thou art of the witnesses.
Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O Allah, our Lord, send down for us a table from heaven, to bring us a feast from the first of us and the last of us, and a sign for us, and give us sustenance, for You are the Best of sustainers."
Allah said: "I am sent down to you, but whoever disbelieveth of you, then I will punish him with a torment I will punish him."
And when Allah said, “O son of Mary, son of Mary! Why do you not believe?” He said, “What, do you not believe?” Say, “You do not say to you.” Say, “I have no knowledge of what you say.” Say, “I will surely know what is in my hearts.” And what is within your hearts, you know what is within your hearts; indeed you know the truth.
I did not say to them except that I commanded them to worship except Allah, my Lord, and your Lord. And I were a witness of them among them, and I were a witness over them; then when You took me, you would have watched them over them. You are the Witness over all things.
If You punish them, they are Your servants; and if You forgive them, You are the All-mighty, the All-wise.”
Allah will say: "This is the day when the truthful will benefit for their truthfulness, for them will be Gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the supreme triumph.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and He has power over all things.
Praise be to Allah, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and the darkness of darkness and light. Yet those who disbelieve take equals with their Lord.
It is He who created you from clay, then has decreed a term and a term, and there is a term in which you doubt.
He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. He knows what you do.
And there comes to them a sign from their Lord, but they turn away from it.
And indeed they denied the truth when it came to them, but the news of what they used to mock will come to them.
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them, who had not established you in the earth, and We sent down upon you abundant rain from the sky, and made rivers flow beneath them. So We destroyed them for their sins, and after their generation after them.
And had We sent down to you a Book, and they would have touched it with their hands, those who disbelieve would say: This is naught but plain magic.
And they say, “Why has not a angel been sent down to him?” Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided for them, then they would not be reprieved.
And had We made him an angel, We would have made him a man, and We would have confounded them in the matter which they were confounding.
And indeed there were Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW), but those who scoffed at them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Travel in the earth and see how was the end of those who denied (the Truth)."
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To Allah. He has prescribed for Himself mercy. He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection, there is no doubt. Those who lost their souls will not believe.
To Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing."
Say: 'Shall I take for myself a protector other than the heavens and the earth, and the earth, and the feeds of Allah." Say: "I am commanded to be the first of the first, and be not one of the polytheists."
Say: "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a dreadful Day."
Whoever is spared, on him is the mercy of that day, and that is the manifest triumph.
And if Allah touches you with hardship, none can remove it but He; and if He touches you with good, He has power over all things.
He is the All-dominant, the All-wise, the All-knowing.
Say to them: "The truth is with Allah." Say: "I am the witness of Allah. I have revealed to you that which you have been sent down to, and you have been sent down to Him." Say: "I have no knowledge over you." Say: "I do not bear witness with Allah." Say: "I do not bear witness to you."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own sons. Those who have lost their souls will not believe.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies His signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers do not prosper.
And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, then We shall say to those who associated others with Allah: "Where are the partners which you professed?"
Then they will not be able to say: "By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters."
See how they lie against themselves, and what they used to invent has forsaken them.
And among them are some who listen to you, and We put veils on their hearts lest they understand their ears, and deafness in their ears, and if they see the sign, they would not believe in it. And when they come to you with you, they say, “This is nothing but myths of the ancients.”
And they keep away from him, and they turn away from it, and they do not destroy except themselves, but they do not know.
And if you could see when they are made to see the Fire, they will say, “Alas, would that we had been sent back, and we would not deny the signs of the signs of our Lord.”
Nay, but they concealed what they had been concealing, and if they were returned to, they would surely have been forbidden, and they are liars.
And they say, “There is nothing but our life of this world; and we shall not be resurrected.”
And if you could see them when they are presented before their Lord, He will say: 'Is this not the truth?" They will say: 'Yes, by our Lord!" He will say: 'Then taste what you used to disbelieve."
Those who deny the meeting of Allah will be lost. When the Hour overtakes them suddenly, they will say: "Alas for us!" They will bear their burdens on their backs, and they will bear their burdens on their backs. Evil is what they did.
And the life of this world is nothing but a sport and an amusement; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for the pious. Will you not then understand?
We know what they say to you. It is not for you to deny them. The wrongdoers are the unbelievers.
And indeed many Messengers have already denied before you, and they exercised patience and constancy, until Our help came to them. There is none who can alter the words of Allah. And there has come to you the news of the Messengers.
And if their turning away is hard for you, then if thou canst a tunnel, then wert a tunnel into the heaven, or bring them a sign to them; and if Allah had willed, He would have made them all guidance; then do not be of the ignorant.
Only those who hear respond to Him; and the dead will be the dead, and to Him they will be returned.
They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Allah is Able to send down a sign, but most of them know not."
There is no animal on the earth, nor on its wings, nor its wings, nor its wings. We have nothing in the Book, but to their Lord.
Those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb. God leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. He will guide whom He wills.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me, if Allah's punishment comes upon you, or the Hour comes to you, will you call upon any other than Allah, if you are truthful?"
In fact, He will call you to Him, and He will remove what you call upon Him, and He will remove that which you ascribe to Him.
And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad SAW), and We seized them with poverty and hardship, so that they might humble themselves.
But why did they not submit when Our punishment came to them, but they were humble, and their hearts were hardened and Satan made their deeds appear to them.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened for them the gates of all things, and when they rejoiced in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were in despair.
So the people of Pharaoh were destroyed. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me, if Allah had put your hearing and your sight, and your hearts, and your hearts, who can restore you other than Allah?" See how We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and they turn away from it.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me, if Allah's punishment come upon you unawares or openly, or do not be destroyed except the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)?"
And We send not the Messengers except as bringers of glad tidings and warners. And whoever believeth and amendeth, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
But as for those who deny Our signs, they shall be punished for their punishment.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I follow only that which is revealed to me." Say: "Are the blind equal and those who are blind? Will you not then understand?"
And warn those who fear their Lord before them, that they may have no protector nor intercessor besides Him, so that they may be godfearing.
And let not those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His countenance. You are not accountable for you for their reckoning, nor are they accountable for you for what you seek them, so you turn away from them.
And thus do We try some of them in order that they may say: "Are these those whom Allah has favoured among us?" Does Allah not know those who do not know?
When those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: "Peace be upon you! Your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself. And whoever commits evil in ignorance, then thereafter repents, and thereafter repents, then He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Thus do We explain Our signs, and so that the way of the faithless is manifest.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not worship those whom you worship besides Allah.” Say, “I do not follow your desires, and I would surely be guided, and I will not be guided.”
Say: "I am only a clear proof from my Lord, and you deny Him. I do not ask what you seek to hasten. The decision of Allah is the truth, and He is the Best of deciders."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you seek to hasten for what you had been decided, I would have been settled between you and you would have been settled." And Allah knows well the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).
With Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them but He. He knows that which is in the earth and the sea. Not there is no leaf but He knoweth it, but there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, but there is no less than it, nor is it recorded in a clear Book.
It is He who brings you out of the night, and He knows what you earn, and He raises you to die, so that you may be returned to Him. Then to Him you shall return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
He is the Conqueror over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, and when death approaches you, Our messengers command him, and they are not neglectful.
Then they are returned to Allah, their True Master. His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest of reckoners.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Who rescues you from the dangers of the land and sea, and when you call upon Him in humility and in secrecy, (saying): "If only we could give us from this, we will surely be among the grateful."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "It is Allah who saves you from all and from every distress, and then you associate partners with Him."
Say: "He is Able to send down upon you from above you or from beneath you, or from your feet, or to divide you into discordant factions, and make some of you taste the violence of the other. Look how We explain Our signs, so that they may understand."
And the people of your people are the truth, and it is the truth. Say: "I am not a guardian over you."
For every soul is a finality, and you will soon know.
And when you see those who gossip in Our revelations, turn away from them, until they engage with one another. And if Satan forget you to forget, then do not sit away from the wrongdoing people.
As for those who guard (against evil), there is no sin on them in the past, so that they may fear.
And let those who have taken their religion a diversion and a pastime, and the life of this world beguiled the life of this world, and warn the Qur'an of the Day of Resurrection, and they will not have any protector nor intercessor besides Allah. And if any one can be saved from the leave of Allah, they will not be saved from it. Those who have been doing will have a draught of boiling water and a painful punishment.
Say: "Shall we inform you other than Allah, or He will not harm for us any harm?" Say, "If Allah had sent us back to us, we would have turned back to you a fly, so that they would turn back to their backs, and so that they are going to turn away in their hearts." Say, "In the way of Allah, we have been guided to you, and we have submitted to Him, and we have submitted to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds."
And to establish prayer, and fear Him; and it is He who is the Day of Judgment.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth with truth. On the Day when He says: "Be," it is. His Word is the truth. His is the dominion on the Day when the trumpet is sounded. He is the Knower of the unseen and the visible. He is the Wise, the Wise.
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols for gods? I see you and your people in manifest error."
Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of the believers.
So when the night covered a star, he saw a star. He said: "This is my lord." But when it set, he said: "I do not love those who do right."
Then, when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This is my lord.’ But when it set, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I would surely be among the astray.”
And when he saw the sun rising, he said: "This is my lord! This is the greatest lord." But when it set, he said: "O my people, I am innocent of what you do."
I have submitted to my face to Him who originated the heavens and the earth, and I am not of the idolaters.
And his people disputed with him. He said: "Do you dispute with me concerning Allah when He has guided me? I do not fear what you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills. My Lord embraces all things in knowledge. Will you not then understand?
And how should I fear what you fear with Him, and do not fear that you have associated with Allah any authority which He has not sent down to you any authority? Is there any of the two parties?
Those who believe and do not believe in their faith, for them are security, and they are rightly guided.
And this is Our argument which We gave to Ibrahim with his people. We raise whom We will in degrees. Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.
And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Jacob, and We guided them, and We guided Noah before Noah, and his descendants, and his descendants, and Job, Job and Ayub, and Moses and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the gooddoers.
And Zachariah and Yahya, and Isa, and Elias, and Elias was one of the righteous.
And Isma'il, Elisha, and Jonah, and Lot and Lot and Lot and Lot.
And from their fathers and their offspring and their brethren, and We chose them and guided them on a straight path.
This is Allah’s guidance, He guides whomever He wills of His servants; and if they had associated others with Him, they would have been annulled.
Those are they whom We gave the Book, and the Wisdom, and the Prophethood, and the Prophethood are not to believe therein; so do not believe in it, as a people who deny it.
Those are Allah's guidance; so follow their guidance. Say, “I do not ask for you any wage for it; this is only a reminder for all mankind.”
And Allah has not forbidden those who do not say, "God has not sent down any authority." Say: 'The Book has been sent down to you." Say: 'We have sent down the Book which is sent down to you, as a people who has been sent down to you, and what you conceal, and you know what you conceal, and what you say, you will have knowledge of it, and you do not know.”
And this is the Book which We have sent down, confirming what was before it, so that you may warn it before the Mother of Villages and those around it. And those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they keep their prayers.
And who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or say, "It is only revealed to me?" Say, "It is Allah who has sent down to us the Book, so that you will have been sent down in the Book." And when you were guilty, the wrongdoers will say, “Away yourselves.” And the punishment of your hands will be relieved, and the angels will say, “This is the Day of Resurrection.”
And indeed you have come to Us alone, as We created you the first time, and We have bestowed upon you as your successors. And We do not see any intercessors with you, as you claimed with your associates. And you were your associates, and you were your followers, and you were your followers.
It is Allah who brings the grain of the grain and the date-stone. He brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the living from the dead. That is Allah. How then are you turned away?
He is the Cleaver of the Daybreak, and He has made the night for you, and the sun and the moon for calculation. He is the All-mighty, the All-knowing.
It is He who has made the stars for you, so that you may be guided by the darkness of the land and the sea. We have indeed elaborated the signs for a people who understand.
It is He who created you from a single soul, then has a lodging and a resting place. We have explained the signs for a people who understand.
It is He who sends down water from the sky, and We have made it grow to grow with every kind of vegetation, and We bring forth from it grain from which We grow, and with the palm-palm trees, palm trees and pomegranates, and olives, and pomegranates. And the fruit of the palm-trees.
And of the jinn they have set up partners with Allah, though He created them, and they impute to Him sons, and daughters, and daughters. Glory be to Him! High be He above what they associate!
The Originator of the heavens and the earth; how can He have a son when He has no spouse? He created all things, and He has knowledge of all things.
Such is Allah, your Lord, La ilaha illa Huwa there is no god but He, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. He is the Guardian of all things.
Vision comprehendeth Him not, but He comprehendeth the sights, and He is the Subtile, the Aware.
Surely your insights have come to you from your Lord. So whoever sees it, so it is for his own soul; and whoever goes blind, it is to his own soul; and I am not a guardian over you.
Thus do We explain Our signs to them, so that they may say: "You have studied," and that We may make it clear to the people who know.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord; there is no god except Him; and turn away from the polytheists.
And if Allah had willed, they would not have associated others with Him. And We have not appointed you over them, nor are you to see them.
Do not revile those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they are disrespectful by ignorance. Thus, We have made every seeming to every nation to be attractive to their deeds. To their Lord they will return, and He will inform them of what they used to do.
And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they would believe in it. Say, “The signs are only with Allah.” And if it came to them, they would not believe in it, and they would not believe.
And We turned their hearts and their eyes, as they did not believe in the first instance, but We will leave them in their transgression, and We will wander blindly in their footsteps.
Even though We had sent down angels to them, and the dead had spoken to them, and the angels had gathered them all together, they would still not believe unless Allah willed, but most of them are ignorant.
And thus have We appointed for every prophet an enemy, and the jinn, and the devils, inspiring every one of their speech. And if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them with what they fabricate.
And those who do not believe in the Hereafter, that it may be the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter, and that they may be satisfied.
Say, “Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, when it is He Who has sent down to you the Book?” Those whom We have given the Book know that it is the truth from your Lord; so do not be among the skeptics.
And the Word of your Lord is the truth and the justice of justice. There is no changing to Him. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
And if you were most of the majority of the earth, they would lead you astray from the way of Allah. They follow nothing but conjecture, and they are only conjecturing.
Surely your Lord knows best those who have gone astray from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
And if you believe in Allah's Name, eat of what you have been mentioned.
And what is the matter with you that you do not eat the name of Allah when He has forbidden to you what He has forbidden to you, that you may be compelled to one another? Many of the people of knowledge are misled by their own desires. Your Lord knows the transgressors.
Forsake the outward sin and the inward sin. Those who commit sin shall be requited for what they used to do.
And eat not that which Allah hath not mentioned, and that which is in the name of Allah is; surely verily, the devils inspire their minions to make you dispute, and if you obey them, then you are idolaters.
Is he who was dead, then We gave him life and have appointed for him a light which he walks to one people? Is he not like those who are secure of the darkness of darkness, he will not emerge out from it? Thus are the recompense of those who labor.
And thus do We destroy every town in its city, to make mischief in the land, and they do not commit except except themselves, but they do not know.
When a sign comes to them, they say: "We will not believe until we believe in the Book of Allah." Allah knows that which He has bestowed upon His servants, and Allah is the best of those who are guilty of the Fire, and a severe punishment.
Whomsoever Allah desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills to misguide, He makes his breast narrow, tight as if he were climbing to the sky, he would climb it to the like of the sky. Thus Allah lays down those who do not believe.
This is the path of your Lord, straight. We have explained Our signs for a people who understand.
For them is the abode of their Lord, and He is their Master, and He is the Best of their deeds.
On the Day when He will gather them all together, He will say: 'Company of jinn! Many of you have turned away of the jinn." And the adherents of the jinn will say, “Our Lord, we have created some of us.” And We will say, “Your Lord, the Fire, the Fire.” He will say, “Your dwelling is the Fire; and your Lord is Wise, Knowing.”
And thus do We make the wicked among the wicked among the wicked of the wicked.
Did there not come to you apostles of your own Messengers, relating to you My verses, relating to you My verses, and warned you of the Day of Resurrection? They will say: 'We bear witness against ourselves." The life of this world beguiled them, and they bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers.
This is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly, but they were unaware of their ignorance.
And for all of them are degrees of what they have done, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
Your Lord is the All-sufficient, the All-merciful. If He wills, He could take you away, and He will raise you as He wills, as He produced you from the people of the seed.
Indeed that which you are promised will come to pass, and you cannot frustrate it.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Work according to your station. I am working (in your work). You will soon know that the Hereafter is in the Hereafter. The wrong-doers will not prosper."
And of the cattle, He has created for them as a share of the cattle and the cattle, and they say: "This is for Allah." And they say: "This is for Allah, and our associates is not to be fulfilled." And what is the partners of the partners of Allah, and that which they ascribe (to Allah). And what is they that which they judge!
And thus did the children of the children of the children of the polytheists seem made to seem fair to their children, and made their own desires, and made their religion blurred to them. Had Allah willed, they would not have done it. So leave them alone, and follow what they fabricate.
And they say: "These animals and crops are forbidden, except those whom we have forbidden to eat, except those whom we permit, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, and cattle, which they pronounce not pronounce to Allah." They will punish them with a terrible punishment.
And they say: "What is in the bellies of our cattle is reserved for our males, and for our wives, and it is born in the same." But if it be born, they will be partakers in all. He is All-knowing, All-knowing.
Lost are they who slay their children foolishly, without knowledge, and forbid what Allah has provided for them, inventing lies against Allah. They have gone astray and are not guided.
It is He who produces gardens trellised, and untrellised, and palm-trees, and crops of crops, olives, and pomegranates. Each one of them eat, so that they may eat its fruits and pay the day of its harvest; and do not be wasteful; indeed Allah does not love the prodigal.
And of the cattle are some, and some of the burdens of the cattle, and eat of what Allah has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; indeed he is your open enemy.
Eight pairs, of the sheep, and of the goats. Say: 'Is it the two males He has forbidden, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful.
And of the camels, two of the two camels. Say: 'Is it the two males He has forbidden, or the two females, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were you present when Allah enjoined you to forget?" And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, without knowledge? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I have not been forbidden to eat that which has been revealed to me in order to eat that which is forbidden to eat, except that which is dead, or blood, and blood. And the flesh of the swine has been forbidden to other than the name of Allah. And whoever is constrained by necessity, not desiring it, and indeed, your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.
And to those who were Jews We forbade the Jews, and the fat of them, and the fat of them, and the fat of them, and the entrails, and the entrails, and the entrails, and the entrails. That was the reward of their insubordination for them, and We have certainly punished them with their rebellion.
But if they deny you, say, “Your Lord is your Lord, and His mercy is not upon the guilty.”
The idolaters will say: "Had Allah willed, we would not have worshipped anything besides Him nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything." Thus those before them also denied the punishment. Say: "Did you bring any proof to you?" Say, "You do not follow the truth. You follow nothing but conjecture. You follow nothing but conjecture."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "To Allah belongs the conclusive argument. Had He willed, He would have guided you all."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Bring your witnesses (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)]." Say, "Bring your witnesses (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], do not bear witness with them, and do not bear witness with them, nor do you bear witness with those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and those who do not believe in the Hereafter, and those who do not believe in the Hereafter.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “O my people, your Lord has made lawful to you what you do not do, and do not associate anything with Him, and do not kill your children, and do not kill your children.” And you are not going to kill them. And do not take your wealth, and you do not die. That is because Allah has given you sustenance, and that you may not be able to eat.
And do not approach the property of the orphans except except the orphan’s property, until he attains his maturity. Give full measure and weight in the balance. We do not give any soul except a burden. And when you speak, then be witnesses, even though you are truthful. And fulfil the covenant of Allah, that you may remember.
And that my path is straight; so follow it, and do not follow the paths of those who lead you astray from His way. Thus, He has commanded you to be so that you may be godfearing.
Then We gave Moses the Book, completing to him a good favour, and explaining all things, and a guidance and mercy, that haply they may believe in their Lord.
And this is the Book which We have sent down, so follow it and follow it.
Lest not say that the Book was sent down to two other before the two groups, and that we were unaware of their teachings.
Or lest you should say, "Had the Book had been sent down to us, we would have been better than guidance than you. There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who is more unjust than one who denies the signs of God and turns away from them?"
Are they waiting for anything except that the angels should come to them or your Lord should come to them, or the signs of your Lord come to you? On the Day of Judgment, when the signs of your Lord will come to you, no soul would not believe in it. Say: 'Wait be with you; we too are waiting."
Those who split their religion into sects and sects, you are not with them. Their affair is only to Allah. He will inform them of what they used to do.
Whoever brings a good deed, it shall be a like of it; and whoever brings an evil deed, it shall be repaid with it, and they shall not be wronged.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Verily, my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path (i.e. the Religion of Islamic Monotheism), the religion of Ibrahim (i.e. the Religion of Islamic Monotheism), the religion of Ibrahim (i.e. the Religion of Islamic Monotheism), and he was not of the polytheists.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice and my sacrifice, my life and my death, is the Lord of all the worlds.
There is no god but He; and I am commanded to be the first of the Muslims.
Say: "Shall I seek a lord other than Allah, while He is the Lord of all things?" Each soul shall bear the burden of its own soul; and no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning what you used to differ.
And it is He who has made you successors on the earth, and has raised some of you above others in rank, that He may try you in what He has given you. Indeed your Lord is swift in retribution, and He is All-forgiving, All-merciful.
I're going to see.
This is a Book which has been revealed to you (O Muhammad SAW), so let it not be your breast in your heart, so that it may be a lesson for those who believe.
Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, and do not follow any other than Him. Little do you remember.
And how many a township We have destroyed, and Our punishment came upon them, while they were sleeping.
So when Our punishment came to them, they said, “Indeed, we were wrongdoers.”
Then We shall surely question those who have been sent to Our Messenger, and We shall question the messengers.
Then We shall narrate them to their knowledge, and We were not absent.
And the weighing on that day is the truth. And those whose scales are heavy shall be successful.
And as for those whose scales are light, it are they who have lost their souls, because they used to deny Our signs.
And assuredly We have established you in the earth and made for you a means of livelihood; little is the thanks you give.
We created you, then then We shaped you, then We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam”; and they prostrated themselves, except Iblis; he was not one of the polytheists.
He said, “What prevented you before prostrating?” He said, “I am better than you.” I said, “I am better than him; You created you from fire, and You created him from clay.”
(Allah) said: "Get down from it! It is not for you to be arrogant in this. Get out, for you are indeed among the humiliated."
He said: Reprieve me until the Day of Resurrection.
He said: "You are granted respite."
He said: "Because You have led me astray, I will surely guide you on a straight path."
Then I shall come to them from before them and from behind them and from their right, and from their right, and from their left, and You will not find most of them thankful."
(Allah) said: "Get out of this, despised, and expelled of those who follow you. I shall fill Hell with you and all of you together."
And We said, “O Adam, dwell in your wife, and eat of Paradise wherever you wish, and do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.”
Then Satan whispered to them so that he might reveal to them their nakedness, and he said to them, “Your Lord is your Lord, so that you may become angels, or you will become angels or immortals.”
And he swore to them, “Indeed I am the most-wisher of you.”
Then he caused them with deceit. Then when they tasted the tree, their nakedness became covered to them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called to them, “Did I not forbid you that I did not forbid you, and I say to you that Satan is an open enemy?”
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will surely be among the losers."
He said: "Get down, you will be enemies to one another. And you will dwell for earth in the earth, and for a appointed term.
He said, “In it you will live, and in it you will die, and you shall be brought forth.”
O Children of Adam! We have sent down to you clothing to conceal your shame, and the garment of piety and piety. That is the best for the people who understand.
O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan seduce you, as he brought your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their garments, so that he may show them their garments, and he sees you wherever you see no one of you, and he sees you wherever you do not see. We have made the devils friends for those who do not believe.
And when they commit an indecency, they say, “We found our fathers doing it, and Allah has enjoined it to us.” Say, “Indeed Allah does not command His commands, and you do not know what you do not know.”
Say: 'My Lord has commanded justice. Turn your faces on your faces, and call your backs to Him, making Him sincere your religion. In Him you will return."
He has guided a party of those who have been guided, and has deserved a party of them. They have taken Satans as allies instead of God, and that they are rightly guided.
O Children of Adam! Take your adornment, and eat and drink, and eat not; surely Allah loves not the prodigal.
Say, “Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has provided for His servants and the good things?” Say, “In this world are the enjoyment of this world, in the Day of Resurrection.” Thus We explain Our signs for a people who know.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has forbidden immoralities, and sin, and sin, and sin, and rebellion, and rebellion, without which you associate Allah without any sanction, and that which you say to Allah."
And for every nation there is an appointed term; and when their term comes, they cannot postpone it, nor can they advance it.
O Children of Adam! When there come to you Messengers from your own, rehearsing My verses to those who fear piety, and those who fear Allah,- they shall not grieve.
But those who deny Our signs and are proud with them -- they are the inmates of the Fire; therein they shall abide forever.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or denies the signs of the signs of his Lord? There is not for them to reach them until the angels came to them, and the angels will say to them, “Where are those whom you used to invoke besides Allah?” They will reply, “We have forsaken us, and they will bear witness against themselves.”
He will say: "Enter the gates of Hell, before those who passed away before you, and some of the jinn passed away before you." And they will be told: "Our Lord, we have led astray astray." Then will the last end of them in the end of the Day of Resurrection, when the last of them will say to the end of their Lord. He says: "Our Lord, we have led astray astray, for you know not."
And the first among them will say to the last of them: "You were not of us, but taste what you used to earn."
Those who reject Our revelations and turn away from them haughtily, the gates of heaven shall not be opened for them, nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. Thus do We recompense the guilty ones.
For them is a bed of fire, and over them is the Fire, and thus do We reward the wrongdoers.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, We do not burden any soul except according to its capacity. These are the inhabitants of Paradise.
And We shall remove whatever rancour in their hearts will be made to flow beneath them, and they will say: "All praise belongs to Allah, Who has guided us to the right path. Had Allah not guided us, we would not have been guided. Our Lord's Messengers has the truth." And it will be said to them: "This is the Garden which you used to inherit."
And the dwellers of the Garden will call out to the dwellers of the Garden: "Our Lord has promised us. Have we have found what your promise promised true true?" They will say: "Yes," and the Caller will say: "Yes, the curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers."
Who averted people from the way of Allah, and seek to make it crooked, and who do not believe in the Hereafter.
And between them is a veil, and on the Day of the Heights, every people will be presented by their mark, and they will call out to the inmates of the Garden, “Peace be upon you!” They will not have entered it, and they will be asked.
