The Beneficent, the Merciful,
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgment
Indeed, you are one of whom you worship, and those who are devoted to Him.
Guide us to the straight path.
The path of those who have believed and do not believe in the path of the devil.
Alif, Lam, Meem.
This is the Book which there is no doubt in it; and those who believe in Allah and follow the straight path.
Those who believe and do not believe in the prayer, and spend from what We have provided them,
And who believe in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed before you, and those who believe in the Hereafter.
These are the guided from their Lord. These are the successful.
As for those who deny the truth, you will not warn them, or warn them, and they do not believe.
God has sealed their hearts and their hearts, and their hearts is a covering, and a great punishment awaits them.
And those who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," and they believe not in the Hereafter.
They have believed in Allah and the believers, but they do not know anything but they are not aware.
They have taken their hearts in their hearts, and they have doubts, and a painful punishment awaits them.
And when it is said to them, "Do not commit corruption in the earth," they say, "We are only reformers."
These are the ones who do not commit evil, and they do not understand.
And when it is said to them: "Believe in the people," and they say, "Shall we believe in it?" They do not believe in it, but they do not understand.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe." And when they are with their devils, they say, "We are only mocking."
God mocks those who disbelieve, and will make them wander perplexed from the earth.
These are they who have purchased guidance for guidance, and they have not been guided, and they have not been guided.
The parable of those who kindled a fire is a fire, and when it lit to him, he took it in a light, and when it lit to them, they will not be able to see it.
Deaf, dumb, blind, and blind.
Or that He sends down water from the sky, and the clouds, and the clouds, and the clouds, and the darkness of the darkness of the clouds, and they have covered their fingers in the darkness of Allah; and Allah is the unbelievers.
The lightning have turned away from their eyes, and they were unable to walk in it. But when they see it, they could not have turned away, and God has made them their hearing, and He has power over all things.
O you who have believed! Worship your Lord, and make you successors before you, and that you may be righteous.
It is He who has made the earth a bed for you and the sky, and sent down water from the sky, and sent down water from the sky, so that you may be equal to God. Do not be equal to God.
And if you do not bring down the Qur'an, then bring down that which is revealed to you, that you may bring witness to Allah, if you are truthful.
And if you do not do, you will not be able to help you; and the Fire will be the fuel of the Fire and the Fire.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, and We have provided them with gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall be provided with bracelets of which rivers flow, and they shall say, “This is what we have been given.” They shall have spouses and their spouses, and they shall abide therein forever.
Allah has not made a example for a gnat. They are a people who believe in the way of Allah. They will say, "This is what is in the hearts of Allah." They are more astray than God. It is not for Allah's way, and He leads astray from the way. God does not guide the unbelievers.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after they break the covenant of Allah, and sever the covenant of Allah and the Last Day, and do not spread corruption in the earth, and they are the losers.
How do you not believe in Allah, and He gave you life? Then He will give you life, then He will bring you back to life, and He will bring you back to life.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth, and He sent down the heavens and the earth, and He has made a barrier between them, and He has knowledge of everything.
And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "I will make it a viceroy in the heavens and the earth." They said, "We will not shed it in the earth." He said, "Your Lord knows what you do not do."
And He taught Adam the names of Adam, and He said: "Bring down what you are promised."
They said: "Glory be to Thee! You have no knowledge of what You have taught us. You are the All-knowing, the All-knowing."
He said: "O Adam! Inform them (O Muhammad SAW), and We have not given you (O Muhammad SAW)." He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth? He knows what I hide and what you hide."
And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," they prostrated him, except Iblis, but he refused to be arrogant. He refused to be of the disbelievers.
And We said, “O Adam, dwell in Paradise and eat of your spouse, and eat you in Paradise, and do not approach her tree, lest you be wrongdoers.”
Then Satan made them leaders from them, and We made them to be a enemy from the sky, and We said, “Go down from your enemies.” And the angels will be settled from the land, and in the morning, and a place of years and security.
Then Adam prayed to his Lord, so that he might turn aright from his Lord; and He is the Relenting, the Merciful.
We said, "Get down from your staff." But when a guidance comes to you from Me, those who follow My guidance will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
But those who disbelieve and do not believe,- they are the inhabitants of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
Children of Israel! Remember My favour which I have bestowed upon you, and fulfil my covenant with Me, and I fear that you shall be of the righteous.
And believe in what has been revealed to you, and do not believe in the truth, and do not believe in the signs of the truth. My Lord is not inattentive of what you do.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth.
Establish the prayer and pay the zakat, and bow down with the poor.
Do you enjoin you who enjoin piety and forget you? Do you not understand?
Seek help in patience and prayer, and pray to the help of God.
Those who do not believe in their Lord, and their Lord will be their returning towards their Lord.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and I preferred you above the worlds.
And guard yourselves from the Day when no soul shall avail another another, nor shall intercession be helped, nor shall intercession be helped, nor shall they be helped.
And (remember) when We saved you from Pharaoh's people, who were afflicting you from your habitations, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. He was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you, and drowned the sea, and We drowned the people of the sea.
And We appointed to Moses forty nights, and We gave you a calf, and he was not unjust to the wrong-doers.
Then We pardoned you, so that you may be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, that he might be guided aright.
And (remember) when Moses said to his people: "O my people! Verily, I have wronged you, but your Lord's command is better for you, and your Lord is your Maker. So turn your back to your Lord, and turn away from Him. He is Forgiving and Merciful."
And (remember) when you said, “O Moosa, we will not believe in you until we see you, and you see the thunderbolt, and you see the thunderbolt.”
Then We gave you the life of your death, that you may be grateful.
And We sent down from you the clouds and the quails and the quails and the quails and the quails and the quails and the quails and the quails, “We have not wronged the wrongdoers.”
And (remember) when We said: "Enter the Garden, and eat therein therein, and eat therein in the gate, and say, "Our Lord will forgive you, and forgive us your sins, and forgive us the reward of the righteous."
But the wrongdoers changed those who were unjust to themselves, so that they had been unjust to the word of their Lord. So We sent down upon them a plague from the sky.
And when Moses said to his people, "Strike your staff." And when you gushed down, it will be in the ground, and We said to each other, "Strike the rock with your staff." And the tribe of the fruit of Allah will be said: "Eat in the land, and do not commit corruption in the land."
And when it was said to them, “Take your place of the morning, and do not be like the rock.” And when the prayer came to you, he said, “Do not be like your Lord’s command.” And the prayer of the House will be settled from your Lord, so that he may be one of those who have been given to you, and the enemy of the Children of Israel, and those who were arrogant, and the enemy of God, and the slaying of the Prophets, and the slaying of the Prophets, and the slaying of the Prophets, and the slaying of the Prophets.
Those who believe and follow the Jews and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and believes in God and the Last Day, and do not believe in their Lord, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We made the Mount above you, and We made the Mount above you, saying: "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you may take heed."
Then you turned away from your Lord, and if you turn away from your Lord, He would surely have destroyed you and many of the losers.
And you did not know those who were given the Sabbath before you, and We said, "We were afraid of you."
Then We made it a example for the people of the city, and We made a lesson for the pious.
And (remember) when Moses said to his people, "Indeed, Allah has made you a cow." They said, "If you are a cow, you are like us." He said, "Indeed, I fear that you are one of the polytheists."
They said: Pray unto our Lord that He may make it a cow. He said, “This is the cow. It is not for us to be a cow, nor virgin, middling, so that she may be a cow.”
They said, "Pray to our Lord that He may make us a sign for us." He said, "This is a cow, a yellow cow."
They said: Pray to our Lord that He may make us a cow that we may make it a cow, and that we may make it a cow, so that we may be guided. And Allah will forgive us.
He said, “He says, “It is not for a cow that she should be able to be able to be a cow or a cow.’ She said, “It is a cow, so that she may be a cow, so that she may be a cow, so that they may be sacrificed.”
And when you did not come to you, after the other, and your mother has reached you, and Allah is aware of what you do.
And We said to him: "Strike not a piece of the mountain." Thus Allah shows you the dead, and shows you the dead, and that you may understand.
Then your hearts became hardened, and We have made for them a flood of which rivers flow, and We have prepared for them stones of which rivers flow, and from which rivers flow, and from which rivers flow; and Allah is not unmindful of what you do.
Or do you believe that they should believe in the way of Allah, and that they should have a party of those who have been given a party of them, and they understood it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe." And when they are with you, they say: "What is the matter with your Lord?" They will say: "What is your Lord." Then do you not understand?
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they hide?
And among them are those who do not know the Book, but they follow the knowledge of the Book, and they do not hear.
So woe to those who have been given the Book, and they say: "This is from Allah." So woe to them for what they have earned, and woe to them what they have earned, and woe to them what they have earned.
And they say, “The Fire shall not touch us for a day.” They will say, “If God had willed, you would have no power to change it.” Do you not know that Allah sees what you do not know?
But those who do evil shall be the worst-doers, and they shall abide therein forever, and they shall abide therein forever.
And those who believe and do good deeds, they shall be the dwellers of the Garden, and they shall abide therein forever.
And (remember) when We made the Children of Israel (O Children of Israel), (O Muhammad], "Do not worship anyone except Allah." And to the parents, and the orphans, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and that you may not turn away.
And (remember) when We made a covenant from you (O Muhammad SAW), that you might not shed your blood, nor your mother's blood, nor your blood, and you are witnesses.
And you will not kill you from your father, and that you may expel you from the Sacred Mosque, so that you may not expel you from your homes, and you will not be able to change your homes. And if you do not believe in this world, and do not have a portion of the life of this world, and those who have been given you will be lost in the life of this world. On the Day of Resurrection, the punishment of the Hereafter will have come to you, and what you do not know.
These are they who buy the life of this world in this world, but they shall not be helped, nor shall they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book, and We gave him the son of Maryam, and We gave him the son of Maryam, and We gave him the Gospel, and We gave him the Gospel, and there was no sign for you. And when you were told, the party of you took the calf, and the other-doers.
And they say, “Our hearts are sealed by the hearts of God.” So God will punish them because of their disbelief, and they will not believe.
And when it had been revealed to those who have been revealed to the Book and that which was revealed to them, they would not believe in the first time. And when they come to them, they disbelieved in it, and the curse of Allah is severe.
Evil is because they have sold evil of what Allah has sent down, so that He may make the people of whom He wills to be feared by His mercy. And those who disbelieve in God's wrath will be wrath from the wrath of God, and there is a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Believe in what God has sent down," they say, “We believe in what has been sent down to us, and we believe in what has been sent down to us.” Say, “God's command is better than you.” Then did you not believe?
And indeed We sent Moses with clear proofs, but he came to you with clear proofs, but you were not unjust.
And when We raised the Mount above you, and We raised the Mount above you, saying: 'Hold down with what We have given you, and do not obey the Children of Israel.” They said, “We hear what you have done.” They said, “It is not for you that you are believers.”
Say: "If the abode of the Hereafter have come to you, and the exclusion of the exclusion of you is exclusively for you, if you are truthful."
And they will not wish that they will be returned to their own hands, and Allah knows best that they are doing.
And they will not find a portion of the life of the life of the life of the world, and there is no more than a thousand years, but if he had a thousand, he would live in the life of this world, but he will be a punishment for them, and Allah sees what they do.
Say, “Whoever is a enemy from Gabriel, so that he may warn the heart of the heart of God, confirming what has been revealed to him, confirming what has been revealed to him, and a guidance and good tidings to the believers.”
Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His angels, and Gabriel and Michael, and that you may be victorious.
And indeed We have sent down to you a clear signs, and none of them will not be unjust.
Why did they not make a covenant from the time of the Prophet, when they broke a covenant from them? But most of them do not believe.
And when the Messenger came to him from Allah, confirming that which is revealed to them, confirming that which has been revealed to them, and the party of those who were given the Book, and they know not.
And they did not follow the people who had followed the Torah, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, who were the ones who had followed him, and they were not guided. And We have given them the Book, so that they should have followed them, and they have followed the way of Allah, and they have forgotten them, and they have forgotten them, and they did not have a portion of the life of the world, and they did not believe in the life of the world, and they have forgotten them. This is the life of the life of the world, so that they may have forgotten.
And if they had believed, and they would have believed, and Allah's reward is better.
O you who believe! Do not say to those who say, “Do not listen to the words of God.” They say, “It is a painful punishment.”
There is not a party of those who disbelieve in the Oneness of your Lord, and they have no faith from your Lord. It is a mercy from your Lord. He chooses whomsoever He wills, and He is the possessor of mighty grace.
And if We take a verse or We abrogate it, or bring it to a means of that which is better, or that you may not know that Allah is Able to do all things.
Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that Allah will not help you?
Or did you come to you with a Messenger before you, and he who believed in the way of Allah? Whoever exchanges the way of his own soul, he will guide him astray.
Many of the People of the Book would not believe after you have become clear to you, after they have become clear to you, and to make clear to you what they were in the Book, and to forgive you. God has power over all things.
And give the prayer and pay the poor-rate, and do not give your charity with it. God is aware of what you do.
And they say, “There is no Jew but a Christian.” They will say, “Do not follow the inhabitants of Paradise.” They will say, “Bring the truth, if you are truthful.”
Yes, but he who submits his face to Allah, and does good, and his Lord will have a fear of his Lord, nor shall they grieve.
And the Jews say, “The Christians are not the Christians, nor Christians.” They say, “The Jews, the Christians, the Christians, the Christians.” They say, “This is what they did not know.” And the Day of Resurrection is the truth. On the Day of Resurrection they will be judged concerning the truth.
And who is more unjust than he who prevents the mosques of Allah, and strives in the remembrance of Allah? They have no fear in the land, nor shall they enter it. Such is the punishment of the Hereafter.
And Allah is the East and the West, and He is the East and the West. So Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
And they say: "Allah has begotten a son." Glory be to Him! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him belongs all things.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees, He says, “Be”; and it is.
And those who say, “Why does not Allah speak to us?” They say, “Why does it not come to us?” They said, “We have neglected what they had done.” Thus is the signs of those who have knowledge of Our signs. Thus are signs for those who believe.
Indeed, We have sent you as a bearer of good news and a warner, and We shall not be among those who deny the truth.
And you will not be asked to ask the Jews, nor the Christians, nor the Christians. And if they follow you, they say, “This is the guidance of Allah.” And if the knowledge of the Book had come to you, you will have no guardian other than Allah.
Those who have been given the Book to whom We have given them a Book, and they believe in it. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter believe in it.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favour which I bestowed unto you, and I preferred you above the worlds.
And guard yourselves from the Day when no soul shall be helped, nor shall intercession be helped, nor shall intercession be helped, nor shall they be helped.
And (remember) when his Lord said to the people of his Lord, and said: "I will make him a leader of you." He said: "I shall not believe in my Lord." And he said: "I do not think of the wrong-doers."
And We made the House of the House (the Ka'bah) as a place of the sanctuary, and We made the House of the House of the House, and We said: "Take the House of my House, for those who have been given the House and the House, and those who bow round, and those who bow down, and those who bow down, and those who bow down.
And (remember) when Abraham said: "O my Lord! Make for me a secure land, and provide the fruits of the heavens and the earth." He said: "As for those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, I shall surely give them a increase in the earth, and I shall increase for him the torment of the Fire, and I shall increase for him the torment of the Fire."
And (remember) when Abraham and Ishmael (Ishmael) and the people of the House: "Our Lord! Accept us from us, for Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing."
And pray to our Lord, and make us submissive to Thee, and make us submissive to the House of the House, and make us submissive to Him, and forgive us. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
O our Lord! follow the people who have come to them, and teach them the Book, and teach them the Book and wisdom; and Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.
And who is more unjust than he who follows his religion, and he who chose him? We chose him in the world of this world and in the Hereafter.
When his Lord said to him: "Submit!" He said: "I am the Lord of the Worlds."
And (remember) the legacy of his father, and he said: O my son! Allah hath chosen you, and be not a Muslim, and we have not been Muslims.
Did you think that when We raised the children of the Children of Israel, when he was said to him, “Do you worship me?” They said, “We worship God, the Creator of the Descendants of Jacob, and Isaac, and Isaac, and to Him we have submitted.”
This is a nation who have passed away, so that they may be rewarded with what they have earned, and what you have earned.

And if they believe in Allah, they have believed in you. And if they turn away, they will not cease to believe in it. And if they turn away, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
It is Allah who guides us from the right path, and who is the Best of those who have submitted.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What is the matter between you, if you dispute in Allah? Our Lord is your Lord, and our Lord, and to Him we have put our trust, and to Him is your return.”
Or do you say, "Abraham, Isaac, Isaac and Jacob, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Jews, and the Christians?" Say, “Who is more unjust than he who conceals the testimony of Allah, and who is more unjust than he who does not wrong?”
This is a nation who have passed away, so that they may be repaid to what they have earned, and what you have earned, and you shall not be questioned.
The people who say, “What has turned away from them.” Say, “Then will He be the East and the West?” He guides whom He wills, and guides whomever He wills.
And We did not find you as a helper in the land, and We have made you a warner, and We have not related to you a Messenger, and a party of those who have passed away before you, and he who turns away from his own soul, and he is not for those who have believed in God, so that he may change the way of Allah. God is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
We will see you from the sky, and We will make you turn away from you, and you will turn away from you, and you will turn away from your Lord, and you will turn away from your Lord, and that it may be the truth, and that they may know the truth; and the truth is the truth from your Lord. God is not unaware of what they do.
And if you have given them the Book, they do not follow you, nor follow you to follow the qiblah of those who have been given you. And if they follow you, they will not follow you. And if the knowledge of the Book had come to you, you will be among the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We have given the Book know it, and they know what they did not know, and they know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be of the skeptics.
And there is one who turns away from it, so that it may be good to you, and that you may seek that Allah is Able to do all things.
And when you turn away from you, your face is the Sacred Mosque, and your Lord is the truth; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you turn away from the Sacred Mosque, and turn away from the Sacred Mosque, so that you may turn away from your Lord, and do not turn away from you, and do not turn away from you. I fear that you fear Me, so that you may be guided.
(O Muhammad), you have come to you a Messenger from among you, who recites to you Our revelations, and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know.

Those who conceal the signs of Allah and the Book after We have revealed to them, We have clarified the Book of the Book which We have given them. God curses the curse of the disbelievers.
Except those who repent and do good deeds, and forgive them; and I am the Relenting, the Merciful.
Those who disbelieve, and die, and die, and the curse of Allah will be the curse of the angels.
They will live in the Fire, and they shall not be able to repel it, nor shall they be reprieved.
And Allah is Allah, there is no god but He, the Merciful, the Merciful.
The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, and the day, and the day, and the day, and the day, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the heavens and the earth, and the stars, and the heavens and the earth, and that there is a sign from the sky.
And there are no other than Him who call to Allah, and they are not equal to Him. They do not believe in God and the Last Day, and do not see the way of Allah. And if they see the punishment, they will know that God is severe in punishment.
And when they are followed, then those who are given the Fire, and they shall be judged in their faces.

And when it is said to them: "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say: "What is the matter of us." They say, "Even though we had found their fathers following their fathers, even though they were guided."

Those who conceal that which Allah has sent down in the Book, and purchase not a portion of the price of Allah, it shall neither be doubled for them on the Day of Resurrection, nor shall they speak to the Day of Resurrection. They shall be a painful punishment.
These are the ones who have purchased guidance for guidance, so that they may turn away from the way of Allah, and that they shall be abiders.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book in truth, the Book of the Book, in the Book, in the sight of the Book.
And of the two-Arabs, there is no blame in the heavens and the earth, and those who believe in the way of Allah, and those who are given the prayer and the needy and the emigrants, and those who are rich, and those who are rich, and those who are rich, and the prayer, and those who are rich, and they are rich, and they are rich.

It is not for the People of the Book, that it may be a guide, and that he may be a party of those who have followed it, and he who goes away from the way of his own soul, and he who goes away from it, and he is not for you to change it. And if you have been exhorted, He will make you independent, so that you may be guided. God guides you that you may be guided.
And when My servants ask you, I say, "I am near." But when the answer of the supplicant comes to Me, he says: "I am only going to believe in the believers, so that they may believe."

These are the truth of Allah, which We recite to you, and to you is the messengers.
Those of whom We have given the Jews and the Christians, but We have given them a son, and We have given them a son, and We have given them a son, and We have given them a son, and We have not made a covenant for them, and they have not followed them.

Have you not seen that Allah has made a example to you that he might be raised by the earth? He said, “Do you think that God will bring him back to you?” Then We will bring you down from the land, and it will be struck from the dead, so that it might see it, so that it might see it, so that they might see it, and it is how the camel of the dead. Then when it came to them, he said, “What is the matter of God.” He said, “This is how God has power over all things.”
And when Abraham said: O my Lord! Lo! I have not raised unto you the dead, and I shall not be able to make the dead to bring you forth from the name of my Lord. And when they come to you, they said, “Do you come to me from the name of Allah?' So when they come to you, they will turn away from it, and said, “Indeed, I are the All-knowing.”

O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders and injury, but God who spends the Last Day, and who spend the like of God, and do not be like a rock, or a smooth rain. It is a smooth rain for a people who do not know it, and it is a smooth rain. God does not guide the people who do not know. God does not guide the unbelievers.

Those who spend the night and the night, and the night, and those who are with their Lord, their reward shall be their reward, nor shall they grieve.
It is not for a man who is sick in the way of Allah, and he is a evil man, and he is in the way of Allah. And he who is in his own accord will be better than it, and he who is in the sight of Allah; and it is more than that which Allah has given you. And whoever is given it to Allah's pleasure, it is they who are the inmates of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
God effaces usury and nurtures usury; and Allah does not love the ungrateful.
Those who believe and do good deeds, and perform the prayer and pay the zakat, their Lord will pay them their wages, and they shall not be helped nor shall they grieve.

And if you do not know the words of Allah, then know the truth, and do not know the words of justice. God is aware of what you do.
And if you are in a journey, then if you do not find a scribe, then if he is a sin, then if he is a sin, then he who fears his trust in his Lord. And if you do not know Allah, he will be his guardian. And whoever conceals Allah, his heart is the truth. God knows what you do.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Whether you conceal what is in your hearts or conceal Allah, He will punish you with what He wills, and He punishes whom He will. And Allah is Able to do all things.
The Messenger has believed in that which has been sent down to him from his Lord, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, and the angels, saying, “We have heard what we have been commanded.” They say, “We have submitted to our Lord.” They say, “We have submitted to our Lord, and You are the best of all things.”
He has no power to forgive him except that He wills. And if they do not forgive us, he will have no power to forgive us. Our Lord, forgive us, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and forgive us, and forgive us from the way of the Fire.”
I don't worry.
God! There is no god but He, the Living, the Eternal.
He has revealed to you the Book that is revealed to the truth, confirming what was revealed before it and the Torah and the Gospel
That is a guidance and guidance for the people who have been revealed to Allah and the Last Day. For God is severe in punishment. He is the Almighty, the Avenger.

It is He Who has sent down the Book with the Book, the Quran, the Holy Mosque, and the Balance, and the Balance, and the Balance, and the Balance.

Our Lord! Make us not a guide of our hearts, so that He might guide us from the hearts of our hearts. Thou art the Grantor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.
Our Lord! You shall gather you together from the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, the promise of Allah does not fail.
Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them against Allah, nor shall they be helped.
Like the people of Pharaoh's people and those before them, but they rejected Our signs; and Allah seized them for their sins. God is severe in retribution.
(Muhammad), say to those who disbelieve, “You will be overcome in the Fire, and it is the abode of the Fire.”
There is no party of you who have been divided in the two religion, but there is a sign for you in the way of Allah. There is a party of you who have disbelieved in the way of God, and He has made a way for them. God is sufficient for those who do good.

Indeed, the religion of the Book is the religion of Allah, and those who differ in the Book after it had come to them, after they differ in the Book after it had come to them. God is swift in reckoning.
And if they argue with you, say: "I have submitted to my religion, and I am not guided." Say: "If you follow the religion of the Book, they will not follow you." And if they follow you, they will be guided. And if you turn away, then, Allah is All-Aware of all things.
Those who believe not in the signs of Allah, and slay the prophets, and slay the prophets, and give a painful punishment.
These are they who have lost the life of this world and the Hereafter, and they shall have no helpers.
Have you not seen those who have given a portion of the Book who have given a portion of the Book of the Book of the Book of the Book? But they turn away from them, and they turn away.
That is because they say, "The Fire will not touch us from the Day of Resurrection." They will have no helpers, and they will be wronged.
So how will it be, when We shall gather them all together in the Day of Resurrection, that every soul shall be repaid for what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
Say: "Praise be to Allah! If Thou givest to whom Thou givest sovereignty, He will forgive whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt. Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt, Thou abasest whom Thou pleasest, and Thou art Able over everything.
You cause the night to enter the night, and the day and the day, and the day, and the dead, and the dead and the dead; and You shall bring forth the dead from the living; and Thou givest forth the measure.
Do not be like those who believe in God and the believers, but if he should not be able to harm them. And fear God, and fear Him; and Allah is ever towards you.
Say: "Whether you conceal what is in your hearts or conceal it, Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He is Able to do all things."
On the day when every soul shall be confronted by what he has earned, and he will be wronged in what it had done, and it will be that Allah will wish it, and He warns you of His command. God is ever Forgiving and Merciful.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you love Allah, I will love you, and Allah will forgive you your sins and forgive you your sins. God is Forgiving and Merciful."
Say: "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger." But if they turn away, then Allah does not love the disbelievers.
Indeed Allah chose Adam and Ishmael and the descendants of Noah and the descendants of the worlds.
The descendants of the two parties, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
And the wife of Imran said: "O my Lord! I have vowed to Thee in dedication of dedication of my womb, so that I may do that which is in my womb, for Thou art All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
And when she reached her, she said, “My Lord, I have vowed to myself, so that she may be a female.” She said, “Do not be like a female, and I have named her Mary, and I have named her Mary, and I am a guardian from the devil.”
So her Lord accepted her from the acceptance of his Lord, and gave her her good, and provided her in the care of the Garden. Whenever she had made her a sanctuary, she said, “O Maryam, why you have not come to you.” She said, “This is God, the Lord of whom He wills.” And Allah provides a provision for whomever He wills.
Zachariah prayed to his Lord, saying: "Lord, grant me my offspring. You are the All-Hearer, the All-seeing."
Then he stood praying from the sanctuary, saying, "We have given you good tidings of John." Thus God has given him a Word from Allah, and a prophet, and a prophet and a prophet.
He said, “O my Lord! How can I have a son when old age has overtaken me, and my wife is barren?” He said, “God does whatever He wills.”
He said: O my Lord! Lo! there is a sign unto me, but I shall not speak to you except a sign from thy Lord. And when there is a sign unto you, and thy Lord's glory, morning and evening.
And (remember) when the angels said: "O Maryam, Allah has chosen you and purified you, and He has chosen you above you and sons.
O Mary! Be obedient to your Lord, and bow down to those who bow down before Him,
These are the news of the unseen which We have revealed to you, and We have not given you any of you, nor did they see their pens, nor did they see the calf, and they disputed in it.
And the angels said, “O Mary, the son of Maryam has come to you from your Lord.” He said, “The Messiah of Maryam, son of Maryam, son of Maryam, son of Mary, and a honorable abode.”
And he will be in the cradle, and in the cradle, and he shall be of the righteous.
He said, “My Lord! How can I have a son when I have not touched myself?” He said, “It is only Allah who creates what He wills. He creates what He wills, and He says, “Be”; and it is.
And We gave the Book the Book, the Torah, the Gospel,
And We sent the Children of Israel, saying: "I have come to you with clear proofs, and I shall make you a Sign from your Lord, and that you may see that Allah will make it a sign from your Lord, so that you may see that Allah will raise it from the land and the earth, so that you may see it, and that you may see that God will make you know, and you are believers."
And I have been given the Torah which has been revealed to you, confirming the Torah and the Gospel, so that I may make clear to you a sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me.
Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him. This is the straight path.”
And when the unbelievers saw them, he said: "Who shall be my helpers in Allah?" He said: "Allah is the helpers of Allah. We believe in Allah and bear witness that we are Muslims."
Our Lord, we have believed in what we have sent down, and follow the truth and follow the witnesses.”
And they schemed, and Allah's plan, and Allah is the Best of planners.
And (remember) when He said, "O Adam, I have chosen you, and I shall be with you, and those who do not believe in the Day of Resurrection, and those who follow the truth, and those who follow the truth will be brought to you, and you will not be able to dispute between you.
But those who disbelieve, and gave them a taste of the life of this world, and in the Hereafter there shall be no helpers.
And those who believe and do good deeds, He will pay them their wages, and He does not love the unjust.
These are the Verses of your Lord, the Verses of the wise Book.
And the example of Allah has made the example of a man who created him from a man, then He created him, and said: 'I am of him.”
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be of the skeptics.
And when they come to you with clear arguments, say: 'We shall not return to our sons, and our sons, and our sons, and our women, and our women, and our women, and we are of you, and the curse of Allah.”
This is the true narration. There is no deity save Him. God is the Almighty, the Wise.
But if they turn away, then surely Allah knows the corrupters.
Say: "O People of the Book! Come to us, and do not associate anything in the Book, and do not associate anything with anything except anything." They will say: "It is no god but He." If they turn away, they will say: "If we submit to Allah, if we are believers."
O People of the Book! Why do you argue in the Torah and the Gospel, and what was the Torah and the Gospel? Why do you not understand?
(O Prophet), you have no knowledge over you. Do you argue in what you have given you? God knows what you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew nor a Nazarene. And he was a upright friend, and he was not of the idolaters.
Indeed, he was a group of those who believe in his Lord, and the Prophet, and the believers, and the believers; and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
Some of the People of the Book follow you, but they lead you astray, but they lead you astray, but they are not aware.
O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah, and do not make witness?
O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth and conceal the truth and know what you conceal?
Among the People of the Book say: "Believe in the Book of the Book, and be not in the morning and the morning, and that they may turn away in the morning."
And do not be like those who follow the religion of his religion. Say: "This is the way of Allah." Say: "What is the way of your Lord." Say: "What is Allah's Hand, or He will bring it to whom He wills, and He is the All-embracing, the All-knowing."
He singles to whom He will, and He is the Owner of Mercy.
Among the People of the Book, there is no blame for you, if you entrust them with a heap of gold, and if you entrust a treasure, you will not be able to change it. And if you do not know it, he will have been better for you. They say, "This is nothing but a witness." But Allah knows what they say.
Yes, but he who fulfilleth the covenant of his Lord, and Allah loves the righteous.
Those who sell the covenant of Allah, and sell the covenant of Allah, and do not fear the Day of Resurrection, nor shall they fear the Day of Resurrection, nor shall they fear Him. They shall have a painful punishment.
And among them there is a party of them who distort the Book, and they say, “It is not for you to recite the Book.” They say, “It is not God who has sent down the Book, and it is not for God. God is not unaware of what they do.”
It is not for any soul that he should take to his Lord, and He has given him the Book and the prophethood, and he would say: "I have been commanded to save my Lord." Say: "This is my Lord's command, and that which you do not know."
And they did not believe in the angels, nor did We make you a witness from your Lord, so that He might make you a religion, if you are believers.
And recall what time Allah sent down the Book, and the Prophets, and the Book, and We gave you the Gospel, saying: "Come to you." And when the disciples had come to you, he said: "Come to me." And when the disciples said, "The covenant of Allah is with you." They said, "If you follow the covenant of Allah, we will surely be of you."
But those who turn away from it, it is they who are the transgressors.
Is he not that Allah's is the religion of the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, willingly and unwillingly?
Say: "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us, and the Children of Israel, and the Children of Israel, and the Children of Israel, and the Children of Israel, and to the Children of Israel, and to the Children of Israel, and to Him we submit.
And whoever seeks the religion of Allah, he will not be helped for him, and he will be among the losers.
How who will not believe after they had believed after they had believed in Allah and the Messenger after the truth had come to them. The truth has come to clear proofs. God does not guide the wrongdoers.
These are the ones who have lost their souls, and the angels descend from Allah, the angels.
Abiding therein forever, and they shall not be able to escape therein.
Except those who repent and repent and amend; verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who repent, after having accepted faith, then repent, and then repent, their repentance will be accepted, and they are the wrongdoers.
Those who disbelieve, and die, and die, and will not be accepted by a earthful of gold, nor will they be accepted by a ransom from the earth. They will have a painful punishment.
It is not for you to give you a good deed, and spend you in the way of Allah. God knows whatever you do.
The Jews of the Children of Israel said to the Children of Israel: "Bring fast to the Children of Israel." Say, "Bring down the Torah, if you are truthful."
But whoever fabricates the lie to Allah, then surely Allah is the unjust-doers.
Say, “God has spoken the truth, and follow the creed of Abraham; he was not one of the polytheists.”
The first House of the House is the first one of those who have been blessed in the blessed language.
There is clear signs in the Book, and of him there is a place of security; and whoever enters the House of Allah, it shall be a need of the House of the House, and it is for Allah who gives him a way, and it is not for whom God is Self-sufficient, All-laudable.
Say: "People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the signs of Allah, and know that Allah is witness in what you do?"
Say: 'O People of the Book! Why do you wish to change the way of Allah, who believes in the way of Allah? Do you know? God is not aware of what you do.”
O you who have believed! If you obey a party of the People of the Book, We will turn you to you, and you will disbelieve.
And how can you disbelieve, when you are recited to you, and the Messenger of Allah and His Messenger? And whoever obeys Allah, He will guide him to a straight path.
O you who believe! Fear Allah and fear Him, and do not be Muslims.
And hold fast to the religion of Allah, and do not follow the favor of Allah, and He has made you taste your hearts, and He has made you taste the Sacred Mosque, and He will make you taste the brink of the pit, and He has made you taste the Fire, and He has made you clear to you, so that you may be guided.
And there is no blame for you in this world, and forbidding those who do good, and forbid what is wrong, and forbidding the wrongdoers.
And be not like those who were divided in the Book after they had come to you, after they had come to them, and there is a great punishment.
On the day when the faces will be whitened, and the faces of the faces will be blackened, and they will be told, “Did you disbelieve?” Then you will be said to the disbelievers, “Taste the punishment for the faithless.”
And as for those whose faces will be whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the Verses of Allah, which We recite unto you, and Allah does not guide the unjust.
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and to Allah is the return.
It is not for the people of the two generations and the two parties, and that you may act righteously in the way of Allah, and that you may believe in it, and that they may believe in it. That is better for those who believe in the Book, and they are believers.
They will not be able to harm you, but if you turn away from them, they will not be helped.
They will be pitched on one another in the cave, and they will be in the wrath of Allah. They have incurred the wrath of Allah, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the Prophets, and the prophets. That is because they disbelieved in the signs of Allah, and because they did not believe.
They are not the People of the Book, but they recite the people of the Book. They recite the Verses of Allah, and they are in the night.
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and forbid what is wrong, and forbid what is wrong, and forbid what is wrong, and they are virtuous.
And those who do not have any reward of what they have done; and Allah is Knowing of the pious.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them against Allah. They are the inhabitants of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
The parable of the life of the life of this world is like a frosty wind which smites the harvest of a people who have wronged it, and destroys it in the land. God does not wrong to them, but they wronged themselves.
O you who have believed! Do not take your friends to you if you do not spare you, but you will not harm you, but you will not harm you in the least. Hatred knows what is in the breasts of their mouths. God knows what you do not know.
It is not for you who love you, but if you are expelled with them, they say, "We believe in you." And when they see you, they say, "We hear," and when they turn away, they bite their fingers in rage. God knows what you hide.
And if good good befalls you, it grieves you, but if you do good, they rejoice in it; and if you are patient, they will be niggardly, and God knows what you do.
And when the two hosts came to you, the two armies met the believers, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
When two groups among you were among you, and Allah has forgiven you, and Allah is the Guardian of the believers.
And Allah has made you victory in Badr, but that you might help you, and that you may fear God.
And when the angels said, “What is the matter with your Lord?” He said, “Will you not help you with God?”
Yes, but if you are patient and fear the enemy, you will not be able to assist you from your Lord, and you will be victorious.
And Allah has made a covenant for you, that you may be comforted in the hearts of that which Allah has given you; and Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
He will destroy them from the unbelievers, or that they might cut off the punishment, and they are disappointed.
It is not for you that He may punish them from the least, or whether He intends to punish them from the punishment.
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and punishes whom He wills; and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and redoubled, and fear God, that you may prosper.
And guard yourselves from the Fire, for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, and that you may receive mercy.
So enter forgiveness from your Lord, for His forgiveness, for the heavens and the earth, prepared for the heavens and the earth. That is a great success.
Those who spend their wealth and spend from the cause of Allah, and pray to the anger of their own hands, and pardon Allah, and Allah loves the virtuous.
And those who commit evil sins, and when they commit wrong, remember Allah, who shall forgive forgiveness from Allah, and forgive the sins of the sins, and who does not know anything of Allah.
Their reward will be forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. Such is the reward of the Garden.
You have already lived before you before the people of the earth, and travel in the land and see what was the end of the rejecters.
This is a reminder for mankind, and a guidance and a admonition for the believers.
And do not be saddened in the least, and you will not be accepted, if you are believers.
If there is a wound for you, a wound is like a wound, so that they may be like those who have been warned, and that We may make the people of those who have faith in the way of Allah. God does not love the unjust people.
And that they may believe in Allah and the Last Day,
Do you think that you will not enter the garden, and that God has promised you, and those who do not believe in the cause of Allah, and who are patient?
You were longing before the first death before you, and you did not see the first time.
Muhammad is the Messenger of a Messenger. If you have passed away before him, then he will not be able to help you from your heels, nor will you turn back on your heels, nor will he turn on his heels. God will reward the grateful.
It is not for the time of the time of the time of Allah, until He has ordained the term of the night, and He will give him a good life, and We shall give him the reward of the world, and We shall give him the reward of the good.
And many of the Children of Israel, who did not believe in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, and Allah loves the steadfast.
And they said, “Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses in our sins, and forgive us and our feet, and forgive us from the disbelieving path.”
So Allah gave them the reward of this world, and the reward of the Hereafter; and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back from your heels, and you will become losers.
Nay, Allah is your Guardian, and He is the Best of helpers.
He has promised those who disbelieve and do not associate anything with Allah with which He has sent down to them, and they will abide in it; and the abode of the Fire is the worst abode.
And Allah has promised you the truth, that you may capture you. And when you were averse to the matter, you would surely have made it to be of you. But if you were averse to the matter, you would surely have been better to you, and He has endeared you to you, and He has endeared you to you, so that you may be guided in the life of this world, and that you may know that God will restrain the believers and the believers.
And you did not come to you, but when you came to you from the side of your Lord, so that you might not grieve in the rear, and you will not grieve in your rear, and you will not grieve for you. God is aware of what you do.
Then He made you successors in the land, and made the covenant between you, saying: "We have no power of you." Say: "Do you not know that Allah has not given you a portion of the earth, or that He might know you, or that you may not be able to stay back in the way of Allah." Say, “God knows what you do not know, and He knows what you do not know. God knows what you do not know. God knows what is in the hearts.”
Those of you who turned away on the Day of Judgment, it will not be averted from the devil, and that Satan might make them slip in the way of Satan. God is Forgiving and Forbearing.
O you who have believed! When they have disbelieved in the way of Allah, they would have followed you, but if they were in a journey, they say, “Had we not slain, we would not have died, and we have not been slain. God will give life to the dead. God is aware of what you do.”
And if you are slain in the way of Allah, or die in the way of Allah, will be better than forgiveness.
And if you do not die or die, then surely Allah will surely help you.
That is because of the grace of Allah, that He may test you, and that they may be patient, and pardon you, and forgive them, and consult them with their affairs; and if you turn away, then put their trust in Allah. God loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, there is no help for you. If He forsakes you, He will help you, if you are believers.
It is not for the Prophet, nor that he may be treacherous to his own soul, and he will be paid back to the Day of Resurrection, and he shall be paid back to what he has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah, he is he who is laden with the wrath of Allah, and his abode is Hell, and he is the abode of Hell?
They are the ones who are in Allah's presence, and Allah is aware of what they do.
Indeed Allah has conferred the believers to the believers, who recites to them a Messenger from among themselves, who recites to them the Book, and teaches them the Book and wisdom, although they were in clear error.
And when you had come to you, he would have befallen you twice, and said, “What is the matter?” Say, “It is only for you, and God has power over everything.”
And on the day when the two hosts met, the two armies met by the permission of Allah, and that He might test the believers.
And that He might make the hypocrites and the hypocrites, and the hypocrites say: "If we have slain, we would not believe in you." They will say, "If we have slain, we would not believe in you." They will say, "The hearts of those who disbelieve and do not believe in their hearts." God knows what they hide.
Those who have taken their covenant and say to their brethren, “If we had listened to us, they would not have been slain.” Say, “Then if you are telling the truth, you will surely be helped.”
And do not think of those who are slain in the way of Allah, but they are dead, and they are in their Lord.
They rejoice in what God has given them, and rejoice in what they have been given. They have no fear of what they have done, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in Allah and His bounty, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers.
Those who responded to the way of Allah and His Messenger, and do good deeds, they shall have a great reward and a great reward.
Those who were arrogant said to those who were arrogant, “Indeed, you are afraid of you.” So they believed in their faith, and said, “God is sufficient for us; and Allah is sufficient in need.”
So they returned to Allah and His grace, and they had not touched them, but they did not expect the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the possessor of bounty.
It is only Satan who frightens you, so that you may not fear him; so fear Me, and fear Me.
And do not grieve for those who disbelieve, lest you have no power to harm them. God will not forgive you in the life of the world, and they will have a portion of the Hereafter.
Those who do not believe in the way of Allah will not harm it, and for them is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think of the disbelievers that We have given them respite, but We have given them a respite for them, and We have prepared for them a humiliating punishment.
It will not be able to believe in Allah in the way of Allah, and that He may show you the good, and that which is in the heavens and the earth, that He may guide whom He wills. And believe in God and His messengers, and believe in Him and His Messenger. And if you believe in Allah and His Messenger, you will have a great reward.
And do not covet those who have been given bounty with Allah, that they should not be able to repel it from the way of Allah, for that which they have earned, and that which is bad for them, and that which they have earned is in the Day of Resurrection; and Allah is the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
God has said to those who say, “God is poor.” And when they are rich, they say, “We have been given to the Prophets, and we shall be among the people of the Fire.”
This is because of what your hands have sent before you; and Allah does not oppress the unjust.
Those who say: "Allah has promised us that we will not believe in it, nor shall we have a angel." Say: "Did you come to come to you with clear signs?" Then the warner came to you with clear signs, and say: "Why did you come to you?"
And if they belie you, and those who were before you were messengers, and clear proofs and scriptures and the enlightening Book.
Every soul will taste death, and you will be brought back to your Lord, and you will be paid back to the Day of Resurrection, and he will be admitted in the Fire, and he will be admitted in the Fire, and he will be in the life of the world.
They will be in your possessions and your lives and your lives in the life of the Book and the Book, and that you may have a party of those who have been given the Book before you, and you will be patient. God is better for you.
And (remember) when Allah has given the Book (the Quran) in the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel) in the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel) of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), their hearts will be cut down to them, and they did not fear it, and it is a evil bargain.
Do not be like those who spend their wealth with their own hands, and they have no hope of what they have done, and they have no hope of the punishment, and they will have a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Able to do all things.
And in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, and the night and the moon, for the people of the night.
They remember Allah, sitting, sitting, sitting, and reclining in the heavens and the earth, and say: "Our Lord! You have created us from Thee. Glory be to Thee! You shall be of the Fire."
"Our Lord! You have disgraced on whom You have disgraced, and the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)."
Our Lord, we have heard the caller, so believe in us. Our Lord, forgive us in our sins, and forgive us from our sins. Our Lord, forgive us in the best of the righteous.”
Our Lord! Grant us what You have promised us, and abase us from the Day of Resurrection. You shall not be fulfilled."
Then they will return to their Lord, saying, “Do not take your homes in your homes.” But he will be among you in the Sacred Mosque, and they will live in the Sacred Mosque, and do not approach the Sacred Mosque, and they will live therein forever, and will admit them in the Gardens of Eden. That is the reward of Allah; and God is ever pleased for them.
Do not let the strutting to the disbelievers, the disbelievers,
This is a brief enjoyment; and it is the abode of Hell, and it is an evil destination.
As for those who fear their Lord, their Lord will admit them with gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. Such is the reward of Allah. That is the reward of the virtuous.
And those who have been given the Book in the Book, and that which has been revealed to you, and that which has been revealed to you from Allah and the Last Day, and sell not the price of those who have been given the price of their Lord. For Allah is swift with reckoning.
O you who believe! Endure, and be patient, and be patient, and fear God, and fear Him.
O mankind! Fear your Lord who created you from a single soul, then He created you from a single soul, and created you in the wombs of two years and blood, and that you may fear Him. God is the Guardian of all things.
Give the orphans their property, and do not consume the property of their property, and do not consume their property. This is a great sin.
And if you fear that you do not fear the orphan and the orphans, then do not marry your wives, or if you should not be able to marry you; and if you do not know that you should not be able to marry you. This is better for you, so that you may fear.
Give the women who have divorced their wives, and do not consume the dowry with their own accord. And if you have divorced them, you shall have a share of it.
And do not spend the property of Allah that you may provide the sustenance of God for you, and feed them from the means of the House, and give them the poor, and speak to them kindly.
And spend of the journey, and do not approach them until they have reached their maturity, and give them a share for them, and give them a share for the needy, and give them a share for the needy and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer; and if you do not know them, you shall have no share over them. God is aware of all things.
Men shall be a share for the parents and the needy, and the needy and the needy, and the needy and the wayfarer, and their share shall be written by a little share.
And when the relatives and the orphans are near, and the division of the division of the division of the division, and speak kindly to them.
And fear those who feared their wives and have touched them, or fear their hands, and fear Allah.
Those who devour the property of orphans, and fill up their bellies, and the Fire shall be the Fire.
Allah has forbidden you with a single number, and that which is in the wombs of Allah, that it may be a share between them, and that he may not be able to marry them in the year of marriage; and if it is not for you, he will be better for you, and if you are compelled, then that you may not be able to eat them, and if you should know that the name of Allah is better. And if you do not know the limits of your Lord, then that you may know the limits of your own accord. That is better for you. God is All-knowing and All-wise.
There is no blame for you that you should marry the wives of God, if you have divorced them, but if he should take a bequest, then if it is a sin for them, or if he should take a bequest, and if they have been given a bequest, it shall be better for them, but if they should be better, or if they should be better, and if it is a sin in the way of the marriage, and that it should be better for them, and that he should be better for them. God is the All-knowing, the All-knowing.
These are the limits of Allah. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the supreme triumph.
And whoever disobeyeth Allah and His Messenger, and transgresseth the limits of Allah, He will admit him into the Fire, wherein he will abide forever; and for him is a terrible punishment.
And those of you who commit lewdness in the way of Allah, then if they testify against you, confine the witnesses, and if they testify, confine to them, until they do not desist until they are admonished.
And among the two men who commit fornication, then if they repent, then repent and reform; and if they repent, then verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The repentance of those who repent and do good deeds, that he may be a sin from his own soul. And whoever turns away, then surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Knowing.
And those who do not repent of their sins, and when death comes to them, he says, “If I repent, I will not forgive you, and I have prepared a painful punishment.”
O ye who believe! Lo! there is no blame for you that ye have no wealth, nor that they have not touched you. And if you have not touched them, they would not have given you a year. And if you have been exhorted, you would have made them a little thing, and that you may take a little thing.
And if you have divorced her of the wife of a woman, then that you may take a provision between you, and if you have no power to give you a clear amount, and you would have a manifest authority.

And do not marry your wives of your wives which has been given lawful to you. This is a indecency and a evil thing.
There is no blame for you, when you find your wives, and your mother, and your mother, and your mother, and your wives, and your mother, and your wives, and your mother, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and your wives, and their hearts, and you are not in the right hand.

And if you do not repent, it is better for you. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
Allah wants to make you clear to you, and to guide you from the ways of those who have gone before you, and He is All-knowing, All-wise.
He wants to forgive you from your Lord, and follow those who follow their own desires.
Allah wants to lighten you for a single soul.
O you who have believed, do not approach your property and your children in the property of mutual consent. Do not kill your own people. Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful.

And of the relatives, We have provided for you a share of what We have given them, and those who fulfil their wives to their wives, and speak to them. God is Witness over everything.
Men are not for those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, that they may spend their wealth and their lives in their hearts, and their hearts are straitened from Allah, and that they are rich of their hearts, and that they are rich of their own hands.

Those who are niggardly and bid people to be stingy, and remember what God has given them. They have prepared for them a humiliating punishment.
And those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah, and do not believe in the cause of Allah, and the Day of Resurrection, and who is a companion, and a evil companion.
And why they would not believe in Allah, and the Last Day, and the believers, and those who believe in Allah, and He knows their hearts.
Allah does not wrong the weight of a atom's weight, and if He does good, He will multiply it with a good reward.
So how will it be, when We come to them a witness from the truth, and We shall bring you a witness.
On the Day when the Messenger will come to those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger, and they will not be able to hide anything.
O you who have believed, do not approach your prayers, and do not approach the journey, until you are sick, until you have bathed, or that you may be needy and destitute, and you will not be able to take your faces from your side, or if you should be driven away from your side, or you will be driven away from your side. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
Have you not seen those who have given the Book better than the People of the Book? If you are guided to the way of the way, you are guided to the way.
And Allah knows best that you are in variance. God is sufficient as a Guardian.
Those who have been given the Jews and the Christians, and when they come to you, they say, “We have given them a Book.” And when they come to them, they say, “This is better than us.” But the punishment of Allah is greater than them, so that they may say, “This is better than us.” So the punishment of the unbelievers will have come to them, if they are believers.
O People of the Book! We have revealed to you that which is revealed to you, so that they may turn away from them, and We have not seized them, and We seized them with the words of the Sabbath; and the command of Allah is the truth.
Indeed, Allah does not forgive any other than Him, but He forgives whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills, and he is a great sin.
Have you not seen those who have taken a lie with Allah? He is whom He purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged in the least.
See how they invent lies against Allah? This is a manifest sin.
Have you not seen those who have given the Book a portion of the People of the Book, and those who have been given the Book and those who have been given the Book say: "This is better than the believers?"
These are the ones whom Allah has cursed, and whomsoever Allah curses, there is no helper for them.
Do they have a share in the world? If they have a share, they would not be able to do in the land.
Or do they envy the people who have been given to Allah's grace? He has given them the Book and wisdom, and given them the Book and wisdom and wisdom.
And of those who have been given the Book, they have followed them, and some of them are the Fire.
As for those who reject Our signs, We shall cast them into a Fire, and We shall replace them into their skins, and We shall replace them from the Fire. Indeed, Allah is the All-mighty, the All-wise.
And those who believe and do good deeds shall be admitted into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall live forever; and they shall live therein in the Garden, and We shall admit them with plenteous shade.
God commands you to make your trusts in order that you may judge between you, and judge between you with justice and justice. God is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not quarrel between you, and if you judge between you, then know that God will judge between you and the Last Day. And if you believe in Allah and the Last Day.
Have you not seen those who have believed in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to you? And they have not believed in what has been sent down to you, and they have not gone away from them, and Satan has strayed far astray.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has revealed, and the Messenger, and those who do not turn away from you."
So how will it be, when their misfortune came to them because of what they had earned, and that they might return to Allah, and that which they had been earning.
These are they who have hearts that Allah knows what is in their hearts, and that they may avoid their hearts, and admonish them with their words.
And We did not send any Messenger except to be obeyed by the permission of Allah. Had they obeyed him, they would not have done it, but if they had been wronged, God would forgive you and forgive forgiveness. And Allah is Most Merciful, Most Merciful.
But you will not believe in those who have believed in your Lord, until they have become true to you. And if you judge between them, they will not believe in it.
And had We revealed unto them: "Slay not your habitations or a few," they would not have done it, but they would not have done it, but they would have done it, and they would have been better in the past.
And indeed We have given them a great reward.
And guided them to the Straight Path.
And those who oppose Allah and His Messenger shall be among those who have been given the Book and the martyrs and the martyrs and the martyrs and the martyrs, and the martyrs and the martyrs.
This is the bounty of Allah. God is aware of all things.
O you who believe! Take your precautions in your homes, and let a foot of the two groups go forth.
There is some of you who lag away, but if a misfortune befalls you, he says: "I have been given to you, but I would not be of those who have been given."
And if Allah had pleased for you, He would say, “If I had not associated you, I would surely have been given to me.”
So let those who sell the way of Allah and fight in the life of this world, who will find the life of the life of the world, and who fighteth in the way of Allah, and who shall be victorious.
And why should you not fight in the way of Allah, and fight in the way of the Cave and women, who say, “Our Lord! Rescue us from our town, and appoint us from Yourself, and appoint us from Yourself, and appoint a helper from Yourself.”
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the devil, and fight in the way of Satan, and fight the minions of Satan.
O you who have seen! When the people of the Prophet, then when they have reached you, then, when the Messenger came to you, and the people who had reached them, and the people who had been given to you, who would say, “Our Lord! Give us a respite for us.” And when they do good, he will say, “This is better than us.” And whoever is a good thing, and a good life will be better for you, and they will not be wronged.
Wherever you will find you to die, and if you are with a journey, then if you return to you, they say, “This is with God”; but if a misfortune befalls them, they say, “This is what is with you.” Say, “What is what you have been given?”
Whatever good befalls you is only for Allah, and that you may take a trial from you, and to warn you, and to warn you. God is Witness over all things.
who obeys the Messenger, and whoever obeys him, and he who obeys him, then We have not sent you as a keeper.
And they say, "We have listened to one another." But when they turn away, they turn away in the name of the night, and say, “Do not turn away in the name of Allah. God is sufficient for you. God is sufficient for all things.”
Do they not ponder that Allah has not made the Qur'an upon you, that He would not have a party of them to differ in it?
And when there comes to them a party of the good, they have not yet come to them, and when they had reached them, they would have followed them. And if they had reached the Book, they would have followed it. And if they had been given to the grace of Allah, He would have given you a little friend.
So fight in the way of Allah. It is not for you for you who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and fight in the way of Allah. God is severe in punishment and a great punishment.
Whoever intercedes with a good deed shall be better than it, and whoever is with his own good shall be better for him. God has power over all things.

Allah! There is no god but He; He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection, which is in the Day of Resurrection, and that is the truth.
Do you think that you are in the two groups? God has done their deeds, so that they may have a evil reward of Allah, so that He may show you their hands, so that He may guide you whom you guide?
It is not for those who disbelieve, if you disbelieve in the way of Allah, so that they may turn away from them; and if you turn away from them, then turn away from them; and if you turn away, then kill them wherever you find them, and do not find any friend for them.
Do not fight for those who have broken their homes in the way of Allah. If you have come to you, they will not fight you, and if you have fought, you would not fight you in the least. Had God willed, He would have given you a group of you; and if you fight you to fight, you will not fight you.
There is no blame for you that you will find a army from them, and turn away from them; and if you fear them, they will not restrain them, and if you fear them, they will not restrain them, nor kill them, and they restrain the hands of them, and kill them, and kill them.
There is no compulsion on the believers, except one who follows him, except one who follows him, who believes in the way of Allah, and follows his heart, and he who believes in Allah and his heart, and he who believes in the way of Allah, and follows the way of his own soul; and whoever follows the way of Allah, he will be better for him, and he who believes in his own accord, and he who does not know the way of his own accord; and Allah is Knowing and Knowing.
And whoever kills a believer, he shall be admitted into the Fire, and he will abide therein forever, and he will be wroth with him, and He has prepared for him a terrible punishment.
O you who have believed, do not follow the way of God, and do not follow the Sacred Mosque, and do not say to those who have been given you in the life of this world, and say, “This is better than you.” And if you are with you, you will surely be satisfied in the land. God is aware of what you do.
Those who have believed in the cause of Allah, and they are content in the way of Allah. They are content in the way of Allah, and those who are rich in the way of Allah, and those who are rich in rank, and those who are rich in rank, and those who stay behind with God. Such is the reward of Allah. God has promised the mujahideen.
Degrees from their Lord and forgiveness; and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Indeed, those who commit wrong will say to those who were unjust, “Do you see the earth?” They will say, “We were in the earth.” They will say, “Was you not Allah’s earth, the earth, the earth, and the earth?” Their abode is the abode of the Fire.
Except for men and women who have no wealth and children, who have no power to give them a way, and they are guided.
That is because Allah will forgive them. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
Whoever emigrates in the way of Allah will find the way of the land, and the earth, and he who emigrates in the way of God, and his home, and his death, and his death, and he who goes away from his Lord, and God is Forgiving and Merciful.

And if you have been commanded, you would have been better to you. And Allah's command is to you, so that you may know what you have done, and to you you will be returned to God. He is your Lord's judgement, and what you do not know.
And that they may argue in what Allah has revealed, and do not follow the desires of those who have been sent down to you, and do not turn away from them. But if you turn away from them, then know that God will punish them with their sins. Indeed, many of them are transgressors.
Or do they argue in the life of the world? And who is better than those who believe in Allah and the Last Path?
O you who have believed! Do not befriend the Jews and the Christians, and you are one of another another; and if you are allies of one another, then surely one of you is one of you. God does not guide the unjust people.
And they will see the hypocrites, lest they say, “This is a misfortune of fortune.” Say, “Perhaps God’s command is nearer to you, or that they may return to the misfortune of the misfortune of the misfortune.” And God knows what they do.
And those who believe will say: "What is the matter with Allah?" They will say, "We swear by the same ones." They have done their deeds, and they will be lost.

And when you call to the prayer, they turn away from the life of the world. That is because they are the heedless.

Say: "Shall I inform you of that which is worse for you?" And those whom Allah has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those whom He has cursed, and those who have fallen astray, and the devil's curse is worse, and they are worse astray.
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe," and when they come to you, they say, "We believe in what they have done. God knows best what they do."
And they see many of you who commit sin, and forbid men, and forbid men, and what they earn.
Why do they prohibit the rabbis and the doctors of their fathers, and that which is forbidden for them? Evil is what they used to commit.
And those who have said, “God is not one of you, except what is in your own hands.” They will be told in the life of the Day of Resurrection.

Indeed, those who disbelieve say: "O Maryam son of Maryam, indeed Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary." The Messiah said, "God's son is my Lord, and my Lord is the Most Merciful, and whoever is in the heavens and the earth is Hell, and whoever is in the abode of Allah, and the abode of the Fire, and a helper for the wrongdoers.

Will they not repent that Allah will not forgive them? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The Messiah of the son of Maryam, did not come to him, before him, before the people of Moses, who lived before him, and the other, and the other, and We gave them clear signs. See how they see the signs of Allah, how they are liars.

And if they had believed in Allah and His Messenger, and that He had not sent down the believers, they would have no guardians. But many of them are believers.

O you who have believed! When you find a portion of the two Mosque, you will not be able to change the Sacred Mosque, and if you are in a journey, you shall not be able to speak to you until you should be able to do, but if you speak to you, he will not be able to speak to you, but God will speak to you, and say, “This is the promise of God.”
And if they see that he is a sin in the way of the deceased, then they are two than the two parties, and they are two than those who say, “Our testimony is truer than Allah.” And if the testimony of the testimony say, they say, “We do not be wrongdoers.”

The son of Maryam (Mary) said: "O our Lord! We have sent down to us from the sky, and from the heaven, and from us, so that we may be a festival from the heaven and the last. This is a sign for us, and give us a sign for us, for You are the Best of providers."
Allah said: "I will surely send you to you, but I will bring you a sign from you, but I will punish him with a torment of the torment of the Fire."
And when Allah said to his son, “O my son! Do I not raise you as a son, and I shall not be able to speak to me.” He said, “Did I not know that I have no power of Allah, and that I should know what I did not know? You know what you do not know. You know what you do not know.”

If You punish them, they will have patience, and forgive them. You are the Almighty, the Wise.

All praise is to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made darkness and light, and the sun and the moon are not equal to their Lord.
It is He who created you from a single soul, then appointed a term between you and a specified term, and that you are truthful.
He is Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and He knows what you do.
There is not a sign from the signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it.
And they belied the truth when it came to them, but they will come to them, and the news of what they used to ridicule.
Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them? We have established them in the heavens and the earth, and We sent down rain from the sky, and We sent down gardens beneath which rivers flow, and We destroyed them with their sins. And We destroyed them with their sins.
And if We had sent down to you a Book which is revealed to them, and they would not have done it, but they said, “This is a obvious magic.”
And they say, “Why has not a angel been sent down to him?” Had We sent down a angel, the matter would have been decided, and they would not be reprieved.
And had We willed, We would have made him a angel, and We have not made them a thing, but they were in confused confused.
Other Messengers were mocked before you, but those who scoffed before them were besieged by what they used to deride.
Say: "Travel in the land and see how was the end of the rejecters."
Say, “To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and all that is in the earth?” Say, “To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth.” He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection, and they will not believe.
And to Him belongs all that is in the night and the day. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Is there any god other than Allah, Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth?" He said: "He is He Who feeds for you, and gives me good measure, and be not of the polytheists."

He is the Almighty, the All Knowing.
Say: "I do not say to you that I have the knowledge of Allah, and what is revealed to me." Say: "I have no knowledge other than Allah." Say: "I have no knowledge other than Allah." Say: "I do not know what Allah has revealed me, and that I should be a idolater."
Those to whom We have given the Book know what they say, and those who do not believe in their own souls, and they do not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects the truth? The wrongdoers does not prosper.
On the Day when We shall gather them all together, then say to those who associated partners to Allah, “Where are you whom you used to worship?”
Then they will not be able to say, “Our Lord, we have not been associated, and we were not of the polytheists.”
See how they lie against the truth, and that which they used to invent lies against them?
And among them there are some who listen to you, but We have put veils to their hearts, and they have not ears of their hearts. And if they see the clear signs, they will not believe in it; and if they come to you, they say, “This is nothing but a clear sorcery.”
And they turn away from it, and they turn away from it, and they are not aware.
And if you see it, they will surely say to the Fire, “What!” They will say, “If only we had been sent back to our Lord, and that we may be of the believers.”
Nay, but they have come to the truth that they had come to them, but they were going to be lost, and they are liars, and they are liars.
And they say, “There is nothing but our life in this world, and we shall not be resurrected.”
And when you see the angels, they will not be able to ask your Lord. They will say, “Yes, why will it come to us?” They will say, “Yes, the promise of your Lord is true.”
Those who deny the truth will have come to them, and when the Hour comes upon them suddenly, they will say, “Woe to us!” They will carry the burdens of what they have earned, and they shall carry their burdens.
The life of this world is nothing but a sport and a diversion and the life of this world. Do you not understand?
Indeed, those who do not know that you have no power to grieve you, but it is the same ones who say, "Indeed, the Zalimun (proofs and wrong-doers, etc.)."
And indeed We have sent apostles before you before you, but they were patient, until they were patient, until they were patient, and they were patient. And there is no changing for you who is the messengers.
And if they turn away from them, then seek a tunnel from the earth, and if it is a sign from the earth, then that they may bring a tunnel from the sky. Had Allah willed, He would have guided them. And do not be of the ignorant.
It is they who are the ones who listen to Allah, and He will raise them to the Day of Resurrection, and He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection.
And they say: "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "It is Allah Who has sent down a sign from Himself, but most of them know not.
There is no crawling creature on the earth and its wings, nor has its wings over its wings. And they have not neglected the Book of their Lord; and they shall be gathered to their Lord.
Those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb, dumb, and guides whom He wills, and guides whom He wills.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you disbelieve in Allah's punishment, then the punishment will come upon you from the Day of Resurrection, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but, if He wills, He will call you, and if you call to Him, He will call you with what you associate.
And indeed We have sent before you many nations before you, so We seized them with distress and adversity, so that they might humble themselves.
And when Our punishment came upon them, they did not humble them, but their hearts became hardened from their hearts, and their hearts became hardened.
And when they forgot what they had been reminded, We opened the gates of the heavens and the earth, and We had opened them to them, and they were seized by it, and they were despondent.
So the people of the people of the wrong-doers were cut in the heavens and the earth, and all praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.
Say: "Have you considered that Allah has forbidden you, and He has made you hearing, and hearts, and hearts, so that He may bring you a seal, so that He may make clear to you a sign? Thus do We explain the signs.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me, if Allah's punishment comes to you, or the punishment of the Zalimun (polytheists, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), who would not be destroyed by the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)."
And indeed We have sent down to you the Messenger, and the givers of good news and warners, and whoever believes and does not fear nor shall they grieve.
And those who deny Our signs, for them shall be a disgraceful punishment.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah." Say: "I do not know what I say, and I am not a angel." Say: "I follow only what is in the heavens and the blind, and I am not alike."
And warn those who fear their Lord in fear and fear their Lord. There is no intercessor but intercessor of Him.
And do not ask those who seek the praise of their Lord morning and evening, morning and evening, and do not ask any of them. You have no power to do you, but you will be among them.
And We have made some of them some of them who say, "We are more than those who have been given." And who is more unjust than those who believe in Allah and does not know?
And when those who believe in Our signs say to those who believe, “Peace be to you, for your Lord is your Lord, and He forgives you, and does not repent, and repent, and repent, and repent, and repent; and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”
And thus We make plain to you the clear path, and We will guide the guilty.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Call upon those whom you call to besides Allah, and do not follow me." Say, "I do not follow my desires, and I will not be guided."
Say: 'I have come to you from clear evidence from my Lord. I do not know anything except what I have given you. God knows what is in the truth, and He is the Best of deciders.”
Say: "If you wish to hasten to hasten, I will surely have done between you. And Allah knows best those who do wrong."
And the keys of the unseen is not equal to Allah. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He knows the grain of the grain, and He knows the earth, nor is there a grain of grain.
It is He who has made you taste the night and the day, and He will make you taste that which is in the day, and He will make you taste that which is before you, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
It is He who has made His servants over you and His angels, and when He had willed, He would have made you a second time, and We shall not neglect the people of those who do not believe.
Then they will be returned to Allah, their Lord. His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest swiftest.
Say, “Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and the sea, and when you call upon Him, He will surely forgive you, and we will surely be thankful.”
Say: 'God delivers you from every distress, and then turn away from Him, that you are of Him.
Say: "He has sent down from you from above you from above you, or from beneath you, or that He may make you taste the two groups, and We have made you taste the Children of Israel, so that you may see."
And the truth has come to you (O Muhammad SAW), but the truth has come to you. Say: "I am not responsible for you."
There is a prophecy for you, and that you may know.
And when those who do not believe in the signs of Our signs, then turn away from them, but if they turn away from you, then turn away from them. And if you turn away, he will be among the wrongdoers.
And those who do not believe in God and the Last Day, and do not turn away from them.
And those who do not believe in the life of the world, and the Hereafter, and those who have followed them in the life of the world and the Hereafter. And they will not be able to change Allah, and He will bring them to the extent of which they have earned, and they will not be able to change it; and they will have a draught of the Fire, and they will have a draught of the Fire, and they will have a painful punishment.
Say, “If we should take a way from Allah, we will surely be guided to our Lord.” And if they do not believe in Allah, we will surely have put down from our Lord, or that they should change the way of Allah, or that they may change that which they have been promised, and those who follow the truth will say, “This is the way of Allah.” And He is the Lord of the Worlds.
And to establish the prayer, and fear Him, and be wary of Him.
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth, and the Day when He will say, “Be,” and it is the Day of Resurrection. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He is the All-knowing, the All-knowing.
And (remember) when he said to his father, “Do you worship idols instead of God? Indeed, I see that you are in clear error.”
And We gave him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that he might be of those who believe.
Then, when the night came to him, he saw the star, and said, “This is my Lord.” But when he saw it, he said, “I do not think it.”
And when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This is my Lord.” But when he saw it, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will surely be of the erring lot.”
Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, “This is my lord.” But when it set it, he said: "I am innocent of what you associate."
I have commanded me to worship the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and I am not one of the polytheists.
And the people of his people came to him. He said: "Do you argue with me about Allah? I have no power to worship Him." He said: "I fear that my Lord wills to change my Lord. He is the Best of all things. Will you not understand?"
And why should you not fear that Allah will not fear you, nor do you fear that which you have associated with Him? Do you not know that which has been sent down to you from your Lord? That is better than the two groups.
Those who believe and do not believe in the way of Allah, they shall have a security for them, and they are rightly guided.
And this is Our argument which We bestowed to Abraham from the people of his own people. We have given him the power of the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is All-Knowing, All-Knowing.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and We gave them the Book, and We gave the descendants of Israel, and the descendants of Noah and his descendants, and Solomon, and Sulaiman, and We gave the righteous.
And Zakariya and John and John, and Elias, and We were of the righteous.
And Isma'il (Ishmael) and Yunus and Yunus and Yunus, and We gave them a great kingdom.
And their descendants and their descendants and their descendants, and We chose them and guided them to a straight path.
This is the guidance of Allah, that He may guide whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills, and that they were wont to have lost.
These are the ones who have given the Book, and We gave them the Book, and We have given them the Book, but they do not believe.
These are they whom Allah has guided, so follow them. Say, “I do not ask you for any payment for you. This is a reminder for the worlds.”
And they say, “What is not Allah's command has been sent down to you, nor has He sent down to you the religion of the heavens and the earth, that He may make clear to you the religion of the heavens and the earth, that you may know what you did not know, and you conceal what you did not know.”
It is a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, confirming that which is revealed to you, and that which is revealed to you, and warn those who believe in the Hereafter and those who believe in the Hereafter, and they are steadfast.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects the truth? Say: "It is not for me to change it." And when it had come to you, he says, “Do not enter your Lord's command to you, and you will not enter the punishment of your Lord.” And the punishment of the Fire will be said, “Suffer the punishment of God, and you were disbelievers.”
We have created you from the first time, and We have not created you, so that you may not be able to help you with your own selves, and you will not be able to help you with your own selves, and you have claimed you in the lurch, and that you were among those who were lost.
It is God Who splits the grain and the date-stone, and He brings forth the living from the dead, and He brings forth the living from the dead; and He is the Protector, and how you are deluded.
The Cleaver of the sun and the moon, and the sun and the moon, and the sun and the moon. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Knowing.
And He it is Who hath made the stars for you, so that He may guide you in the sea, and made the ships subservient to you, and that there may be a sign for those who have knowledge.
It is He Who created you from a single soul, and made a light for you, and a repository for you, and a sign for a people who have knowledge.
And it is He Who sends down water from the sky, and We produce for them gardens of date-palms and grapes, and We have placed forth from the sky a kind of fruit, and We have placed forth water from the sky, and in the midst of the date-trees, and the olive and the pomegranates, and the trees, and the pomegranates, and the trees, and the pomegranates; and in that are signs for those who believe.
And they have not created that which Allah has created for them, and He has created them, and He has created the sons and the females. Glory be to Him! Glory be to Him!
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. He creates the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills, and He is the All-knowing, the All-knowing.
Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no god but He, the Creator of all things. So worship Him. He is the Guardian.
No eyes can grasp Him, and He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Indeed, your Lord has come to you from your Lord, so that he may neither benefit it, and whoever goes astray, his own soul is loss; and I am not a guardian over you.
Thus We make them clear signs, that they may say, “We have studied, and that you may recite in the way of God. This is how a clear thing.”
Follow that which has been revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He; so turn away from the idolaters.
And if Allah had willed, they would not have associated them. We have not made you any guardian over you, nor can they have any guardian.
Do not insult those who call upon God, lest they insult the limits of Allah. Thus We have made the example of their deeds seem attractive to them. And their Lord will inform them their deeds, and their Lord will inform them what they used to do.
And they swear by Allah that they will not be able to believe in Allah. And if a sign came to them, they say: "This is more than Allah." But if they come to you, they will not believe.
And We shall put their hearts to their hearts, so that they should not believe in the first instance, and We shall leave them in their insolence, and We shall make them taste their religion.
And if We had sent down the angels to you, and We have raised the dead, and they would not be able to hide the earth, nor would they be able to believe in Allah. But most of them do not know.
And thus We have made a party of jinn and jinn, and jinn, and jinn, and the jinn, and the jinn, so that they may not be able to change your Lord, so that they may return to their Lord, so that they may return.
And those who do not believe in the Hereafter, so that they may incline to the remembrance of their Lord, and that they may incline to them, and what they earn.
Say: "Shall I seek a judge other than Allah, that He has given you the Book, and that which has been revealed to you, and that which has been revealed to me, and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord? It is not for those who do not believe."
The Word of your Lord is the truth, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
And if you do not see the earth, they would surely follow the way of God, and they follow the truth, but they follow nothing but conjecture.
Indeed, your Lord knows best those who have gone astray from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.
So do not believe in the signs of Allah, that you may be of the thankful.
And what is you that you do not eat for Allah's Name, or that He may make you lawful in the name of Allah, after that He has forbidden you to you? But those who have gone astray from you have gone astray from them. Your Lord knows best the transgressors.
And avoid the outwardness of sin and indecencies, and avoid what is wrong, and they shall not be wronged.
And do not eat in the name of Allah, nor do not oppress the people of the cattle, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil. But if you obey them, they will surely obey you; and if you obey them, you will be of those who are idolaters.
Is he who has made the life of life, and We have made him a light for him, and he is like him who is in a light like him like a light which is like him, so that he may be like the like of it; and they have forgotten the truth.
And thus We have made for the people of the city a town, and they commit evil in the land, and they do not commit themselves, and they are not aware.
And when a clear sign came to them, they say: "We shall not believe in it." They will not believe in Allah, and He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah will destroy the punishment of the disbelievers, and they shall have no punishment.
Whomever Allah guides whom He wills, and guides whomsoever He wills; and whoever goes astray, He opens his breast to whomsoever He wills; and whoever goes astray from his Lord, He does not guide the unbelievers.
This is the Straight Path of your Lord. This is the guidance for those who have knowledge, and We have explained the signs for a people who believe.
Their reward is the Garden of their Lord, and their Lord will be pleased with what they used to do.
On the day when He will gather them all together, and those who were arrogant will say to those who were arrogant, “Our Lord! You have given us the earth, so that you may have followed us in the way of our Lord.” They will say, “This is the refuge of your Lord.” It will be enough for you in the Fire, and there is no refuge in it. Your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Knowing.
And those who do not believe in the way of their own souls, and that they may be frustrated.
Say, “O people of jinns and humans! Why did you come to you to come to you My signs and warning you before the Day of Resurrection?” They will surely say, “We have neglected the life of this world and the Day of Resurrection.” They were the wrongdoers.
This is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly, so that they were unaware of it.
And all of them are degrees of what they have done. Your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
Your Lord is the Self-sufficient, the Owner of Mercy. If He wills, He will take you away, and He will remove you with whom He wills, and He has made you a single nation.
Indeed, the promise of what you are promised, and you cannot frustrate it.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Act according to my ability, and I am working to work. I will know that you will be lost in the life of the Hereafter, and who will not be successful."
And they say to the cattle, and that which is in the bellies of Allah, and they say: "This is our opinion." They shall say, "This is what is in our bellies." They will say, "This is what is in our own hands." God is the best of what they say.
And that they have no helpers in that which they have been forbidden, and that they have been forbidden to them, and that they should not be able to prevent them from the way of Allah, and they would not have followed them. Therefore, if Allah willed, they would surely have done themselves.
And they say, "We have forbidden to eat in the land and eat of cattle." They do not eat them, and We have forbidden them to eat in the name of the cattle, and forbidden to eat the name of cattle. God has forbidden them for what they used to fabricate.
And they say: "There is no animal in the bellies of our males and children." Say: "It is that which is in the wombs of our Lord." And He will punish them with their attribution, and He is All-Knowing, All-Knowing.
Those who have lost their wealth without their offspring, and do not have the knowledge of Allah, and they have been forbidden to themselves. Those who have lost their own souls will have lost, and they are not guided.
It is He Who made gardens trellised and untrellised, and untrellised, and date-trees, and crops of fruit, and olives and pomegranates, and the mountains, and the mountains, and the pomegranates, and the fruits of the fruit, and the sea, and the reckoning, and that they do not spend.
And of the cattle, there is a animal for you, and eat in the sea, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan, and follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is a open enemy.
He has created the two pairs of sheep. Say, “Is the two males and the two females, or the two females, or the two females, or the wombs of the two females? Inform me, if you are truthful.”
And a pair of the two camels, and the pair of the oxen, and the oxen, and the oxen, and the two females, and the two females. Say: 'What is Allah that you do not know?” And if Allah has forbidden you to be a witness, he will have no knowledge in the land, and who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah? And Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Say: "I have forbidden that I have forbidden that which is forbidden to be forbidden for me, or that which is forbidden for you, or that which is forbidden for you, or that which is forbidden for you, or that which is forbidden for you, or that he may not be able to change the limits of Allah. And whoever is the limits of Allah, He is Forgiving and Merciful.
We forbade the Jews and the Jews, and the fat of the sheep, and the fat of the sheep, and the entrails, and the goats, and the entrails, and the entrails, and the bone. We forbade them what they did. We are truthful.
And if they turn away, say, “Your Lord is mercy from mercy and mercy from His mercy.”
Those who say, “If God had willed, we would not have associated anything before Him.” They did not have anything anything, nor did We have forbidden to them anything of what they have been forbidden. You have tasted what is before them, and what is before them. You follow nothing but conjecture.
Say: "It is He who has sent down the Book, and He has guided you, and He guides you to a straight path.
Say, “Bring witness to your witnesses, and do not bear witness with the witnesses.” And if they testify to the truth, they say, “Do not follow those who have been given the signs of the world and those who do not believe in their Lord.”
Say: "I have forbidden you to take your wives from your own accord, and that you should not take your parents to you, and do not take your wealth to you." And he who forbids you from your own accord, and do not eat you, and he who forbids you, and he who forbids you. Do you not know that Allah has forbidden you to you, and that you may know that God has forbidden you to know the truth? That is how Allah's command which you do.
And do not approach the property of the orphan, until he is not in the measure and the balance. And when We give you a measure, the measure and the balance, and the measure, and the poor. And if you speak to you, you shall not speak to you. And fulfil the covenant of Allah, and fulfil the covenant. That is how He explains you that you may take heed.
And this is my way, so that I may follow the path of the straight path, and do not follow your religion, lest you follow them, so that you may guide you from the path of Allah. That is what you have been commanded.
Then We gave Moses the Book, that he might be one of those who have been given the Book, and that which is in the sight of his Lord, and a mercy for those who believe.
This is a blessed Book which We have revealed; so follow Me, and be wary of what you do.
Lest you say, “The people of the Book have been sent down to us, before the people of the Book had been revealed.”
Or lest you say, "If the Book had been sent down, we would surely have been guided to it." And who will have a guidance from your Lord, and guidance and mercy from your Lord. And those who deny the signs of Allah will have a painful punishment.
Do they wait that they will not be able to come to you from your Lord, or your Lord's signs come to you? On the Day when the Hour comes to you from your Lord, who will not believe in it, and they will not believe in it. Say, "Wait, we have done a good lot."
Those who have broken their religion in sects, and they have no power to be divided with them. God will inform them of what they have done.
Whoever brings a good deed shall be like a good deed, and whoever brings a good deed will be repaid to his own soul, and they shall not be wronged.
Say: "It is my Lord who guided me to guidance, and guided to the religion of Abraham, the upright religion, and he was not of the idolaters."
Say, “My prayer is my prayer, and my prayer and my death; and my Lord is the All-returning, the All-merciful.”
He has no partner to Him, and I am the first of the Muslims.
Say, “Shall I seek a lord other than Allah, Who is the Lord of all things?” No soul is to whom you have no soul, nor can any soul bear, and your own soul will bear your burden, and your Lord will judge between you about what you used to differ.
It is He who has made the heavens and the earth in succession, so that He might try you to be in the midst of that which He has given you. Your Lord is swift for you. He is Forgiving and Merciful.
I don't worry.
This is the Book which We have revealed to you, so that you may warn you from that which has been revealed to you, and a reminder for the believers.
Follow that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and do not follow anything other than Him, so that you may understand.
How many a village We have destroyed, or We have destroyed them, while they were sleeping at noon.
And when Our punishment came to them, they said, “This is nothing but what they used to do.”
Then We shall surely question those who have been sent to the Messengers, and We shall question them all.
So We gave them their knowledge, and We were not absent.
On the Day when the secrets will be light, and those whose scales are heavy, and they are the prosperers.
And those whose scales are light, they shall be those who have done their souls, and they have denied Our signs.
And We have made for you the earth for you, and made for you a livelihood, and that you may give thanks.
And We created you, then We shaped you, and We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam”; and they bowed down from Iblis, but they refused to prostrate.
He said, “What prevented you from prostrating?” He said, “I am better than him. I created me from fire, and I created him from clay.”
He said, “Get down from your land, for you will not be able to stay away from it. Indeed, you are of those who are humiliated.”
He said, “Give me respite till the Day of Resurrection.”
He said, “You are waiting.”
He said: "Because I have led me astray, and I will guide you from the Straight Path."
Then they shall come before them, before them and behind them, and from their right hand, and from them will not find mercy.
He said, “Go away from here, then go away from Me. I will fill Hell with you and fill you into Hell.”
“O Adam! Dwell your wife in Paradise, and do not dwell in the Garden, and do not approach your tree, lest you will be wrongdoers.”
Then Satan whispered to them from their hearts, and said, “This is because of your Lord.” He said, “Your Lord does not send a enemy to you, and you will not be able to immortals in it.”
And he said to them: "I am a trustworthy advisor to you."
So Satan seduced them, and when they tasted the tree, their shame became vislible upon them, and they began to cover themselves from the leaves of their Lord, and they said, “Did I not forbid you from the tree of Adam?” He said, “Did I not forbid you from Satan, the One, the seduced?”
They said, “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You have wronged, we will not have mercy, and You shall be among the losers.”
He said, “Get down from your enemies, for you will be a abode from the earth and the earth, and for a appointed time.
He said, “You will live in it, and you shall live in it, and you shall be brought forth.”
O Children of Adam! We have sent down to you a garment from your clothing, and a adornment for your elegance, and that which is right for you, and that which is good, and that which is in the sight of Allah.
O Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you from your parents, so that he might dwell in the Garden, stripping them from their garments, and their clothing, and their clothing, and their clothing, and they did not see you, and they are not believers.
And when they commit a indecency, they say, “We found our fathers practising the creed of Allah.” Say, “God knows what you do not know.” And Allah is not aware of what you do.
Say: "This is my Lord, and He has enjoined the command between you, and He will make you stand to Him, and to worship Him, and to worship Him, and to Him you will be brought back."
He has made a way to the people, and he has followed them, so that he may be a party of them, and Allah has chosen them, and they are rightly guided.
O Children of Adam! Take your adornment and eat, and do not be wasteful, and do not be wasteful. God does not love the wasteful.
Say, “Who has subjected the sustenance of Allah, and has subjected for you the sustenance of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “This is for those who believe in the life of this world and in the Hereafter, and those who do not believe in the Hereafter.”
Say, “My Lord has forbidden indecencies and indecencies, and do not hide the sin of sins, and commit excesses in sin.” And what has been sent down to you from Allah, what has no knowledge.
And every nation is a nation appointed, and when it comes, they shall not be able to change it nor can they advance it.
O Children of Adam! whenever there come to you a Messenger from amongst you, rehearsing to you My signs, and whosoever practices piety and fear themselves, shall not fear nor shall they grieve.
But those who deny Our signs and are arrogant, they shall be the inmates of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects the truth? And when they come to them, they shall not say to those who have been given the Book, and they will say: "Where is Allah's help?" They will say, "We have forsaken them." They will say, "They are liars."
He will say, “Enter the groups of the two groups.” And the groups of the two groups will come to them, and they will say, “Our Lord, we have not adhered to you.” They will say, “You will surely taste the Fire.” And the punishment of the Fire will be said, “You will have the punishment of the Fire.”
And the first among them will say to those who were despised, “Do not be like us. We will taste what you used to do.”
As for those who deny Our signs, and those who were conceited to them, they shall not enter the gates of the needle's eye, nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes to the needle's eye. Thus do We requite the guilty.
They shall have a bed of Hell, and We shall make them taste the Fire. Thus We recompense the wrongdoers.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall not give him any soul. They are the dwellers of the Garden, where they shall abide forever.
And We shall remove their hearts from their hearts, and rivers flow beneath them, and rivers flow therein, and they will say: "Our Lord! If we have not guided us, we would not have been guided, and we would not have been guided. This is the word of your Lord. This is the Garden which you have promised."
And the dwellers of the Garden will say, “Our Lord! Our Lord has promised us.” They will say, “Our Lord, why did you not speak to us?” They will say, “Yes, it is your Lord.” And the wrongdoers will say, “This is the curse of the wrongdoers.”
And those who bar the way of Allah, and hinder others from the way of the Path of Allah, and do not believe in the Hereafter.
And there is a barrier on the Heights, and the Heights shall enter their faces, and their faces shall be in the Garden, and they will say, “Peace be to you!” They will not be entered.
