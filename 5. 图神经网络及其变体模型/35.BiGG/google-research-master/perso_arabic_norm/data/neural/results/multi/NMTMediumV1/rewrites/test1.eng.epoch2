And He is He Who has decreed the angels, and He will raise you from your Lord, and He calls you to die, and when he comes to Us, and they will not be able.

And do not see those who disbelieve in Our verses, when they turn away from you, they turn away from you, and if you turn away, you would not have seen the unjust of the evildoers.
And those who do not believe in the way of the world, but that that that they may be a lesson.
And do not make the People of the Book, and the earth, and the sport, and the life of the life of the life of this world, and that which you may warn the Day of Resurrection, and the Day of Resurrection will be a ransom of the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will not be able for them, and Allah will not guide any guardian, nor He will be a painful punishment.
Say: "Shall I show you to whom He wills, or He will harm to us, or He will harm to us, and we will bring you from the way of the land, and we will not be raised to you?"

So We gave them to what We have given them, and We were not unaware.
And on the day when the weighing will be blown, and it will be the prosperers, and they are the successful.
And as for those whose scales will be changed, and those who were wont of Our signs, they would have been convinced.
And He has made you in the earth and the earth, and He has made for you a sustenance.
And We created you, and We sent you to you, and We sent down to you, saying: "Prostrate down to Adam," and when he was proud, he was not one of them.
He said: "What prevented you prostrating to you, when you see your Lord, He said, "I am better than you, and I created you from the fire."
He said: "This is the rain of your staff, and you will not be like you. Indeed, you are the liar."
He said, "I will give me respite of the Day of Resurrection."
He said: "You will be among the respited.
He said, "I have been guided to you, and I have been guided to you.
And We will turn them back from their own hand, and when their hands will come to them, and they will not find them, and you will not find any way.
He said: "Get your hand with the land, and turn away against you, and turn away from you, and I will fill you with the Fire."
And We said: "O Adam! Enter the Garden of your wife, and eat for you, and eat for you, and do not be of the evildoers."
So when Satan whispered to them, they said to them, and said: "Your Lord is your Lord, your Lord and your Lord, so that you may not be able?"
And He said to them: "I am afraid of you."
So they tasted the tree, and the tree of the tree, and they tasted the tree, and the tree of the tree, and the women, and the women, and their feet, and they said: "Did I not forbid you what you forbid you?"
They said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, if we may forgive us. You will surely be the losers."
He said: "Get your hand, and your houses, and your people, and in the earth, and in the earth.
He will say: "You will enjoy you in the land, and you will be raised to you."
O Children of Adam! We have sent you to you (O Muhammad SAW), and We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW), and the raiment of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the sight. That is the reward of Allah that they may take heed.
O Children of Adam! Do not take your enemy to you, when he may be your wife, your wife, the wife of Paradise, and He will make them from their hands, and He will not make you from your sins, and He will not make you with their sins, so that they may see those who disbelieve.
And when they commit the indecency, they say: "We have heard our fathers, and we testify to our fathers. Say: 'God is not a witness of Allah." Say: "God is not aware of what you do.
Say: "O my Lord, worship of your Lord, and turn witness to Him, and turn away to Him, and turn Him to you, and Him will bring you to you."
A nation who have followed a guidance after them, and those who follow the way of Allah, and those who have incurred God, they are the guidance.
O sons of Adam! Take your sons and your adornment, and do not eat for it, and do not waste the evil.
Say: "Who has forbidden the forbidden of the heavens and the earth." Say: "You have forbidden the best of the heavens and the earth." Say: "These are the life of the life of this world."
Say: "O my Lord, whoever acts is the bounds of my Lord, and the inward of the inward, and the inward, and the inward, and those who commit evil to you, and that which He has sent down to you, you do not know.
And every nation of every nation is a term, but every term comes to them, and they will not be able.
"O Children of Israel! If you come to you a Messenger from your Lord, you will have come to you, and will fear the fear of God, nor will no fear grieve.
And those who deny Our verses, and those who deny themselves, they shall be the inmates of the Fire, and they are the inmates of the Fire.
Who is more unjust than he who invents the lie against Allah, and denies those who have been reminded, and when which is revealed to them, they will say, "Where is the sign of us." They will say, "Where will help God?" They will say: "Then we swear to you," and they will swear to them.
He will say: "Enter the day of Resurrection, the inhabitants of the Fire will be brought to you." They will say, "Our Lord, the group of the jinn." They will say, "Our Lord, we have led astray from the Day of Resurrection." They will say, "Our Lord, we have led astray from a Fire." He will say: "Our Lord! You have no power for you."
And some of them are some among them who will say: "We will not be recompensed to you."
And those who denied Our verses, and those who disbelieve in the Fire, they shall not enter the gates of the heavens and the earth, nor they shall not enter it until they will enter it. Thus, We have prepared a painful punishment.
They shall be the bed of Hell, and the Fire will be opened for them, and We will recompense the evildoers.
And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We will not have any power in any capacity, and they will not be in the inhabitants of the Fire.
And We will remove their deeds in their hearts, and they will be admitted to them, and they will say: "Praise be to us." They will say: "Our Lord! Had we not not have guided us, we would not have been guided to us." Say, "This is the Garden of your Lord."
And the dwellers of the Fire will say: "Our Lord, what we have been promised to us, we would not have been been sent to our Lord." They will say: "Yes!" They will say: "Yes," they will say, "Yes!" They will say: "Yes!"
And those who disbelieve fight in the way of Allah, and those who believe in the way of Allah, they will not believe in the Hereafter.
There is the veil of the town and the Heights, and the inhabitants of the Heights, and the inhabitants of their Lord will be brought to them, and they will say: "Peace," and they will not be able.
