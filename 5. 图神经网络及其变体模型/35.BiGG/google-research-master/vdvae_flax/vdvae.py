    """Evaluates a VDVAE.

    Args:
      sample_rng: random key for sampling.
      num_samples_to_generate: number of images to generate from the prior
        distribution, conditioned only on optional context vectors. This
        argument should be provided only when inputs is not provided. If
        provided, it should be positive.
      inputs: an optional batch of input RGB images of shape [B, H, W, C], where
        H=W. These should be provided when training the VDVAE. These inputs
        should be of type uint8.
      context_vectors: an optional batch of input context vectors of shape [B,
        D] that the VDVAE is conditioned on. These can be omitted, in which case
        the samples will be conditioned on the inputs only if they are provided,
        or not conditioned on anything otherwise.
      temperature: when inputs are not provided, each decoder block samples a
        latent unconditionally using the mean of the prior distribution, and its
        log_std + log(temperature).

    Returns:
      A VdvaeOutput object containing sampled images. If inputs were provided,
      the sampled images are sampled using the posterior distribution,
      conditioned on the inputs (and optional context vectors). In this case,
      the output also contains the elbo, reconstruction loss and KL divergences
      between prior and posterior for each block of the decoder. If inputs are
      not provided, samples are produced using the prior distribution,
      conditioned only on the optional context vectors.
