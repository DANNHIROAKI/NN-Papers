# Skillful Precipitation Nowcasting Using Deep Generative Models of Radar

This repository is a supplement to "Skillful Precipitation Nowcasting using Deep
Generative Models of Radar" and provides necessary code for loading data from a
large scale nowcasting dataset and obtaining predictions with the pretrained
model.

Please see the Colab notebook for further details:
