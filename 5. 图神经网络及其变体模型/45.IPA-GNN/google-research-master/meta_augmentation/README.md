Meta-Learning Requires Meta-Augmentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the code and dataset for [Meta-Learning Requires Meta-Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05549),
which was accepted to NeurIPS 2020.

DClaw data is available at `data/dclaw`. See the README in that folder for
details. Omniglot and mini-ImageNet data should be downloaded separately,
copied to the `data/` directories, then processed. Processing should only need
to be done once.
