# Activation Clustering

## Overview

This is an implementation of the Activation Clustering model used in [Explaining Deep Neural Networks using Unsupervised Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07477).

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/google-research/google-research.git --depth=1
    ```

1. Build the docker image (includes downloading example model and notebooks):

    ```
    cd google-research/activation_clustering && docker build -t activation_clustering .
    ```

1. Run the docker image as follows, which starts a jupyter server in the docker container and allows access from the host machine:

    ```
    docker run -it -p 8888:8888 activation_clustering
    ```

1. In a web browser, navigate to the address shown by the docker run command above, it should look something like `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=1234abcd...`.

1. Follow the example notebooks in `examples/cifar10/` for training an activation clustering model from a baseline model, and for visualizing similar images and concepts.
