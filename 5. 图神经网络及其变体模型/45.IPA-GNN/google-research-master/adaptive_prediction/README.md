### Overview
This package contains code for online learning of dynamical systems via adaptive dynamics prediction. The code is self-contained in the included iPython notebook rigid_body_adaptive_prediction.ipynb, and considers rigid body rotational dynamics as a worked-through example.


### Usage instructions
