While exact sales figures for flip-flops are difficult to obtain due to the large number of stores and manufacturers involved, the Atlanta-based company Flip Flop Shops claimed that the shoes were responsible for a $20 billion industry in 2009.	虽然由于商店和厂家的数量庞大，很难获得确切的人字拖鞋销售数据，但在 2009 年，一家总部在亚特兰大的公司 Flip Flop Shops 声称人字拖鞋带来了 200 亿美元的收益。
Furthermore, sales of flip-flops exceeded those of sneakers for the first time in 2006.	2006 年，人字拖鞋的销量甚至首次超过了运动鞋的销量。
If these figures are accurate, it is remarkable considering the low cost of most flip-flops.	如果这些数据是准确的，考虑到大部分人字拖鞋的成本很低，这是个惊人的事实。
The modern flip-flop has a very simple design, consisting of a thin rubber sole with two straps running in a Y shape from the sides of the foot to the gap between the big toe and the one beside it.	现代人字拖鞋设计简约，包括薄的橡胶鞋底和两条 Y 型带子，带子从脚的两侧一直延伸至大脚趾和第二个脚趾之间。
They typically do not have a strap around the heel, although heeled varieties are available, as well as flip-flops designed for sports, which come with added support common to athletic shoes, with the thong between the toes.	虽然有高跟的版本，但通常跟部没有带子。此外也有专为运动设计的人字拖鞋，带有运动鞋常见的附加支撑以及脚趾处的人型带子。
Most modern flip-flops are inexpensive, costing as little as $5 USD, or less in some parts of the world.	大部分现代人字拖鞋价格便宜，只需 5 美元，在部分地区价格甚至更低。
They are made from a wide variety of materials, as were the ancient thong sandals.	与老式人字拖鞋一样，它们也由多种材料制成。
The modern sandals are made of more modern materials, such as rubber, foam, plastic, leather, suede, and even fabric.	现代凉鞋会由更现代的材料制成，包括橡胶、海绵、塑料、皮革、绒面革，甚至还有布料。
Thongs made of polyurethane have caused some environmental concerns; because polyurethane is a number 7 resin, they can't be easily discarded, and they persist in landfills for a very long time.	聚氨酯制成的人字拖鞋引发了一些对环境的担忧，因为聚氨酯是 7 号树脂，难以分解，会在垃圾填埋场保存很长一段时间。
In response to these concerns, some companies have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber, such as that from used bicycle tires, or even hemp, and some offer a recycling program for used flip flops.	为了回应这些担忧，有的公司开始销售用可回收橡胶（例如从自行车旧轮胎上回收的）或大麻制成的人字拖鞋，有的公司为旧的人字拖鞋提供回收计划。
Because of the strap between the toes, flip-flops are typically not worn with socks.	由于脚趾中间有带子，人字拖鞋通常不会搭配袜子穿着。
In colder weather, however, some people wear flip-flops with toe socks.	但是天气冷的时候，有的人会用分趾袜搭配人字拖。
The Japanese commonly wear tabi, a type of sock with a single slot for the thong, with their zōri.	日本人通常会穿足袋，这是专为 zōri 设计的分趾袜子。
While flip-flops do provide the wearer with some mild protection from hazards on the ground, such as hot sand at the beach, glass, thumb tacks or even fungi and wart-causing viruses in locker rooms or community pools, their simple design is responsible for a host of other injuries of the foot and lower leg.	虽然人字拖鞋确实能为穿着者提供轻微防护，免受地面隐患危害，例如沙滩的热沙、玻璃、图钉，甚至还可以在更衣室或社区游泳池里避免感染真菌或导致疣的病毒，但其简单的设计可以回导致脚部和小腿遭受其它伤害。
Walking for long periods in flip-flops can be very tough on the feet, resulting in pain in the ankles, legs, and feet.	长时间穿着人字拖鞋走路对脚非常不好，可能会导致脚踝、腿部和脚部疼痛。
A 2009 study at Auburn University found that flip-flop wearers took shorter steps and their heels hit the ground with less vertical force than those wearing athletic shoes.	奥本大学 2009 年的研究发现，与运动鞋穿着者相比，人字拖鞋穿着者步伐更小，鞋跟碰地时垂直方向的力量更小。
Individuals with flat feet or other foot issues are advised to wear a shoe with better support.	患有扁平足或其他足部问题的个人建议穿支撑力更好的鞋子。
The lack of support provided by thong sandals is thought by some to be a major cause of injuries.	有的人认为由于人字拖鞋缺乏支撑力，更容易造成伤害。
Some flip-flops have a spongy sole, causing the foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground (over-pronation).	有的人字拖鞋鞋底柔软，导致足部在落地时比平常更向内卷（足外翻）。
Flip-flops can cause a person to overuse the tendons in their feet, resulting in tendonitis.	人字拖鞋会导致足部肌腱使用过度，最终造成肌腱炎。
Ankle sprains or broken bones are also common injuries, due to stepping off a curb or tumbling; the ankle bends, but the flip-flop neither holds on to nor supports it.	由于走下路缘或摔倒，很容易造成脚踝扭伤或骨头断裂；脚踝弯曲时，人字拖鞋不跟脚或无法支撑它。
The straps of the flip-flop may cause frictional issues, such as rubbing, during walking.	走路时，人字拖鞋的带子可能会导致摩擦问题，例如磨脚。
The open-toed nature of the thongs may result in cuts, scrapes, bruises, or stubbed toes.	由于人字拖鞋无法包裹脚趾，可能会造成割伤、划伤、瘀伤或踢到脚趾。
Despite all of these issues, flip-flops do not have to be avoided completely.	尽管有这些问题存在，但没有必要完全避免穿着人字拖鞋。
Many podiatrists recommend avoiding the inexpensive, drug store varieties and spending more on sandals with thick-cushioned soles, as well as ones that have a strap that's not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle.	许多足科医生建议避免在药妆店购买平价凉鞋，应该花多点钱购买有厚底的凉鞋以及带子材质不是帆布并且覆盖面接近脚踝的凉鞋。
A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a device used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped shape (though some are covered in plastic).	回形针是用来固定多张纸张的工具，通常用钢丝制成，弯成环形（有的表面会用塑料覆盖）。
Most paper clips are variations of the Gem type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire.	大多数回形针的原型都是 19 世纪 90 年代或更早出现的宝石型回形针，其特点是钢丝被弯成了两个几乎完整的圆形。
Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper.	回形针的原理是利用了钢丝的可弯曲性和弹性，以及钢丝和纸张之间的摩擦力。
When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two "tongues" of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together.	当在回形针两“舌”之间插入合适数量的纸张时，回形针的两舌会被分开，发生弯曲，并将纸张固定在一起。
Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes.	回形针的形状通常是有直边的椭圆形，但也可能是三角形或圆形，或是更复杂的形状。
The most common material is steel or some other metal, but moulded plastic is also used.	最常用的材料是钢或其他金属，但也会使用模压塑料。
Some other kinds of paper clip use a two-piece clamping system.	有些其他类型的回形针会使用两片夹紧的结构。
Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips.	最新的创新产品包括多彩涂塑回形针和弹簧装订夹。
According to the Early Office Museum, the first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay in 1867.	根据早期办公室博物馆，首个弯曲钢丝回形针的专利于 1867 年在美国颁给了塞缪尔·B·费伊。
This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together.	虽然专利认可回形针可以用来把纸张固定在一起，但这种回形针最早用于将标签固定在布料上。
Fay received U.S. patent 64,088 on April 23, 1867.	1867 年 4 月 23 日，费伊收到了美国专利 64,088 号。
Although functional and practical, Fay's design along with the 50 other designs patented prior to 1899 are not considered reminiscent of the modern paperclip design known today.	虽然这些设计很实用，但费伊的设计以及 1899 年以前取得专利的其他 50 种设计都不会让人联想起今天的现代回形针设计。
Another notable paper clip design was also patented in the United States by Erlman J. Wright in 1877.	另一种著名的回形针设计也是由艾尔曼·J·赖特于 1877 年在美国获得专利。
This clip was advertised at that time for use in fastening newspapers.	当时的广告宣传称这种回形针可用于固定报纸。
The most common type of wire paper clip still in use, the Gem paper clip, was never patented, but it was most likely in production in Britain in the early 1870s by "The Gem Manufacturing Company", according to the American expert on technological innovations, Professor Henry J. Petroski.	研究科技创新的美国专家亨利·J·彼得罗斯基教授表示，宝石型回形针是如今仍在使用的最常见的钢丝回形针类型，从未获得专利，但最可能是由“The Gem Manufacturing Company”于 19 世纪 70 年代在英国生产的。
He refers to an 1883 article about "Gem Paper-Fasteners", praising them for being "better than ordinary pins" for "binding together papers on the same subject, a bundle of letters, or pages of a manuscript".	他提到了 1883 年有关“宝石纸张固定器”的文章，赞扬它们在“同一个物体上固定纸张、固定一堆信件或多页手稿”时“比普通别针更好用”。
Since the 1883 article had no illustration of this early "Gem", it may have been different from modern paper clips of that name.	由于 1883 年的文章中没有附上早期“宝石”的图片，可能会与现代同名回形针有所不同。
The earliest illustration of its current form is in an 1893 advertisement for the "Gem Paper Clip".	它现在形态最早的图片出现在 1893 年“宝石回形针”的广告中。
In 1904 Cushman & Denison registered a trademark for the "Gem" name in connection with paper clips.	1904 年，Cushman & Denison 为回形针注册了“宝石”这个名字的商标。
The announcement stated that it had been used since March 1, 1892, which may have been the time of its introduction in the United States.	公告表示它自 1892 年 3 月 1 日开始使用，这可能是引入美国的时间。
Paper clips are still sometimes called "Gem clips", and in Swedish the word for any paper clip is "gem".	回形针有时仍被称为“宝石针”，瑞典语用“gem”表示所有类型的回形针。
Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest, is the patent granted to William Middlebrook of Waterbury, Connecticut on April 27 of that year for a "Machine for making wire paper clips." The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type.	现代回形针的确切证据可以追溯到最近的 1899 年。在那一年的 4 月 27 日，康涅狄格州沃特伯里的威廉·米德尔布鲁克因“制作钢丝回形针的机器”获得了专利。图片清晰显示了那个回形针恰好是宝石型的回形针。
The fact that Middlebrook did not mention it by name, suggests that it was already well known at the time.	米德尔布鲁克没有以自己的名字来命名，这说明当时它已经很出名了。
Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented.	从那以后，同个物品的无数变体获得了专利。
Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip.	有的是尖头的而不是圆头的；有的尾部的圆环会微微弯曲，更容易插入纸张；有的钢丝上有凸起或小勾，能起到更好的固定作用。
In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular, star, or round shapes.	此外，纯美观的版本也获得了专利，例如三角形、星形或圆形的回形针。
But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular.	但是拥有一百年历史的原始宝石型是最实用的，因此也最受欢迎。
Its qualities—ease of use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling—have been difficult to improve upon.	它的品质（容易使用、固定却不会拉扯以及有序存放）已经达到最佳水平。
National Paperclip Day is May 29.	国际回形针日是 5 月 29 日。
It has been claimed, though apparently without evidence, that Herbert Spencer, the originator of the term "survival of the fittest", invented the paper clip.	虽然明显没有证据，但据称“适者生存”一词的创始人赫伯特·斯宾塞发明了回形针。
Spencer claimed in his autobiography to have invented a "binding-pin" that was distributed by Ackermann & Company, and he shows a drawing of the pin in his Appendix I (following Appendix H).	斯宾塞在自传中声称他发明了一种“装订别针”，由 Ackermann & Company 进行分销，他还在附录 I（以下附录 H）中展示了这种别针的图片。
This pin looked more like a modern cotter pin than a modern paper clip, but it was designed to hold sheets of paper together.	这种别针看起来更像今天的开口销，而不是今天的回形针，但它的确用于固定纸张。
It is approximately 15 cm unfolded.	它展开大约长 15 厘米。
A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866–1910), has erroneously been identified as the inventor of the paper clip.	挪威人约翰·瓦勒（1866—1910）被错认为回形针的发明者。
He was granted patents in Germany and in the United States (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire.	他的类似设计的回形针在德国和美国（1901）获得了专利，但这种回形针没那么实用，因为钢丝的最后部分没有弯曲。
Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway.	瓦勒可能不知道市场上已经有更好的产品，虽然在挪威还未存在。
His version was never manufactured and never marketed, because the superior Gem was already available.	他的版本从未进行生产和市场营销，因为已经有更好的宝石版本。
Long after Vaaler's death his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognised Norwegian genius.	在瓦勒逝世很长时间后，他的同胞编造了一个国家传说，错误地认为是一位得不到认可的挪威天才发明了回形针。
Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip, and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips.	自 20 世纪 50 年代起，挪威词典称瓦勒为回形针的发明者，随后国际词典和许多有关回形针的国际文学也收录了这个传说。
Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of more useful paper clips, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions.	虽然此前已有更实用的回形针，但瓦勒可能成功地在国外为他的设计获得了专利，因为当时的专利机构相当慷慨，会给现有发明的任何类似修改版本颁发专利。
Johan Vaaler began working for Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor in Kristiania in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death.	1892 年，约翰·瓦勒开始在克里斯蒂安尼亚的 Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor 工作，后来晋升为办公室经理，一直在这个职位上工作到逝世。
As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway.	作为专利办公室的员工，他很容易就在挪威获得了专利。
His reasons for applying abroad are not known; it is possible that he wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally.	无人知晓他在国外申请的原因；可能是因为他想确保在国际上拥有商事权。
Also, he may have been aware that a Norwegian manufacturer would find it difficult to introduce a new invention abroad, starting from the small home market.	此外，他可能也意识到挪威制造商很难从小的当地市场向国外引入新的发明。
Vaaler's patents expired quietly, while the "Gem" was used worldwide, including his own country.	瓦勒的专利悄无声息地过期了，而“宝石”却在全球范围广泛使用，包括他自己的国家。
The failure of his design was its impracticality.	他设计的失败之处在于不够实用。
Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip.	由于它没有成熟回形针所拥有的两个完整环形，因此很难将其插入纸张中。
One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle.	人们可以操控内侧钢丝的尾部，使其能够卡在纸上，但外侧钢丝是个死胡同，因为其无法运用扭转原理。
The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper.	回形针会像船的龙骨一样突出，垂直于纸张。
The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.	从常规的宝石型回形针上切下最后的外侧环形以及一条长边，即可验证瓦勒设计的不实用性。
The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country.	挪威回形针传说的提出者是一名挪威国家专利局工程师，他在 20 世纪 20 年代到访德国，登记在德国注册的挪威专利。
He came across Vaaler's patent, but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip.	他发现了瓦勒的专利，但没有认识到它并不是当时常见的宝石型回形针。
In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip.	他在专利局的前五十年报告中写了一篇文章，声称瓦勒发明了常见回形针。
This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.	第二次世界大战后，一些挪威百科全书收录了这则信息。
Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip.	那场战争中的事件很大程度上造成了回形针的神秘状态。
Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway were forbidden.	爱国者在翻领上佩戴它们，用来表示对德国占领者和当地纳粹机构的反抗，因为当时禁止使用其他反抗标志，如国旗徽章或表示被驱逐的挪威哈康七世的密码的徽章。
Those wearing them did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time.	佩戴者没有认为它们是国家标志，因为当时挪威起源的传说不为人所知。
The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity ("we are bound together").	回形针代表着团结统一（“我们紧密相连”）。
The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them could risk severe punishment.	很快就禁止佩戴回形针，佩戴者也可能会面临严厉处罚。
The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952, but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention.	挪威领先百科全书曾在 1952 年的补充卷中提及回形针作为反抗的标志，但没有声称回形针是挪威发明。
That information was added in later editions.	后来的版本中添加了该信息。
According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in France.	根据 1974 年版，使用回形针表示反抗的想法起源于法国。
A clip worn on a lapel or front pocket could be seen as "deux gaules" (two posts or poles) and be interpreted as a reference to the leader of the French Resistance, General Charles de Gaulle.	在翻领或胸前口袋上佩戴回形针可以看作“两杠”的标志，可以指代法国抵抗运动的领导者夏尔·戴高乐将军。
The post-war years saw a widespread consolidation of the paper clip as a national symbol.	战后几年里，回形针被广泛认为是国家象征。
Authors of books and articles on the history of Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial.	有关挪威科技史的书籍和文章的作者都渴望让这个小故事变得更有依据。
They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the fully developed Gem-type clip.	他们选择忽视瓦勒的回形针与成熟的宝石型回形针不一样这一事实。
In 1989 a giant paper clip, almost 7 m (23 ft) high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler.	1989 年，发明获得专利的九十年后，为了纪念瓦勒，在奥斯陆附近的一所商学院的校园里建造了一座几乎 7 米（23 英尺）高的大型回形针雕塑。但这座雕塑是宝石型回形针，并不是瓦勒获得专利的那种。
The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the paper clip culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent.	为回形针起源于挪威这一传说举办的庆祝活动于 1999 年达到高潮，距离瓦勒提交德国专利申请刚好一百年。
A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness.	那年发行了纪念邮票，这是首个引起人们重视挪威创造的系列。
The background shows a facsimile of the German "Patentschrift".	背景是德国“Patentschrift"的摹本。
However, the figure in the foreground is not the paper clip depicted on that document, but the much better known "Gem".	但前景中的形象并不是文件记载的回形针，而是更出名的“宝石”型回形针。
In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (Norsk biografisk leksikon) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the paper clip.	2005 年，挪威国家传记百科全书发表了约翰·瓦勒的传记，表示他发明了回形针。
Wire is versatile in its nature.	金属丝用途广泛。
Thus a paper clip is a useful accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force.	因此，回形针在包括电脑运作等多种机械运作中都是实用配件：只需一点力就可以展开金属丝。
Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need.	有的设备需要使用非常薄的杆按压嵌入式按钮，用户很少需要按压此按钮。
This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an "emergency eject" should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh).	例如，大多数只读光盘驱动器上都有“紧急弹出”，避免突然断电；早期的软盘驱动器（包括早期的 Macintosh）上也有类似设置。
Various smartphones require the use of a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device.	多种智能手机都需要使用回形针等薄的长形物体弹出 SIM 卡，有的 Palm PDA 也建议使用回形针重新设置设备。
The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel.	可以使用回形针作为外壳的钥匙从早期的罗技定点设备中移除追踪球。
A paper clip bent into a "U" can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header).	将回形针弯成“U”型即可在无需连接至主板（将绿色连接至主板顶部的黑色）的情况下启动 ATX PSU。
One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a RS232 interface (or indeed many interfaces).	使用一个或多个回形针即可为 RS232 接口（或其他多种接口）制作回环设备。

The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.	牙医可以使用回形针的钢丝来制作牙桩钉。
Paper clips can be bent into a crude but sometimes effective lock picking device.	回形针可以弯成粗糙但有时很有效的开锁设备。
Some types of handcuffs can be unfastened using paper clips.	有些类型的手铐可以用回形针打开。
There are two approaches.	有两种方式。
The first one is to unfold the clip in a line and then twist the end in a right angle, trying to imitate a key and using it to lift the lock fixator.	第一种是把回形针展开变成直线，然后将尾部扭成适当角度，尝试模仿钥匙并用其抬起锁固定器。
The second approach, which is more feasible but needs some practice, is to use the semi-unfolded clip kink for lifting when the clip is inserted through the hole where the handcuffs are closed.	第二种方法更加可行但需要练习，具体方法是把半展开的回形针插入锁好的手铐中抬起内部结构。
A paper clip image is the standard image for an attachment in an email client.	回形针图像是邮件附件中的标准图像。
In 1994, the US imposed anti-dumping tariffs against China, on paper clips.	1994 年，美国对中国的回形针强制收取反倾销关税。
The Band-Aid was invented in 1920 by a Johnson & Johnson employee, Earle Dickson in Highland Park, New Jersey for his wife Josephine, who frequently cut and burned herself while cooking.	1920 年，强生公司的一名员工厄尔·迪克森在新泽西州海兰帕克市发明了创可贴，缘由是妻子约瑟芬做饭时经常割伤和烫伤自己。
The prototype allowed her to dress her wounds without assistance.	这款最初的创可贴可以让她在没有人帮助的情况下包扎伤口。
Dickson passed the idea on to his employer, which went on to produce and market the product as the Band-Aid.	迪克森把这一思路带到公司，强生公司于是生产了这种产品并以“Band-Aid（创可贴）”的命名进行销售。
Dickson had a successful career at Johnson & Johnson, rising to vice president before his retirement in 1957.	迪克森在强生的事业很成功，1957 年退休前干到了副总裁的位置。
Perhaps a curiosity, the word "Band" in German means tape.	怕有人好奇，此处解释一下，“Band”在德语中是“绷带”的意思。
The original Band-Aids were handmade and not very popular.	最初的创可贴是手工制作的，买的人并不多。
By 1924, Johnson & Johnson introduced machine-made Band-Aids and began the sale of sterilized Band-Aids in 1939.	到 1924 年，强生公司开始推出机器制作的创可贴； 1939 年，强生开始销售消毒创可贴。
In 1951, the first decorative Band-Aids were introduced.	1951 年，第一款装饰创可贴面世。
They continue to be a commercial success, with such themes as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Oliver & Jenny, Superman, Spider-Man, Rocket Power, Rugrats, smiley faces, Barbie, Dora the Explorer, Batman and Duck Dynasty.	这一类创可贴也在市场上大获成功，有米奇老鼠、唐老鸭、奥利弗和珍妮、超人、蜘蛛侠、火箭动力、淘气小兵兵、笑脸、芭比娃娃、爱探险的朵拉、蝙蝠侠、鸭子王朝等主题。
In World War II, millions were shipped overseas, helping popularize the product.	二战期间，数以百万的创可贴被运到国外，帮助推广了这一产品。
Since then, Johnson & Johnson currently has estimated a sale of over 100 billion Band-Aids worldwide.	自那时起，强生迄今在全球销售的创可贴估计已经超过 1000 亿张。
Johnson & Johnson continues to defend the Band-Aid trademark against it being genericized.	强生公司一直维护 “Band-Aid”这个商标名，反对将其通用化。
Band-Aid arguably has, over time, become a genericized trademark in the United States, and a generic term cannot function as a trademark; but Johnson & Johnson has registered Band-Aid as a trademark on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the registration is valid and legal.	随着时间的推移，“Band-Aid”可以说已经成为美国的通用商标，而通用名称是不能用作商标的。然而，强生公司已经在美国专利商标局的主薄注册了“Band-Aid”商标，注册是合法有效的。
A registration on the Principal Register does not create ownership rights under the laws of the United States, and a registration may be challenged and removed if the challenger proves as a matter of fact that the alleged trademark has become generic.	根据美国法律，在主薄上注册并不会产生所有权，如果有人提出要注销某注册商标，并在事实上证明其指称的商标已经成为通用商标，则该注册商标有可能会被注销。
To protect the name, their trademark, Johnson & Johnson always refers to its products as "BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages", not just "Band-Aid".	 为了维护这个品牌名，即他们的商标，强生一直以"BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages"指代这种产品， 而非仅仅叫"Band-Aid"。
