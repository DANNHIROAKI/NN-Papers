In September 1988, during the 20th anniversary celebration of Evergreen Marine Corporation's founding, company chairman Chang Yung-fa announced his company's intentions to establish Taiwan's first private international airline.	1988 年 9 月，為慶祝長榮海運創辦二十周年，長榮公司董事長張榮發宣布，該公司將創辦台灣第一家民間創立的國際航空公司。
The opportunity to create a major Taiwanese airline had just arisen following a decision by the Taiwanese government to liberalise the country's air transportation system.	在台灣政府實施空運系統自由化後，就有機會可以創造一家台灣主要航空公司。
Government requirements still mandated global experience and financial capital requirements for any company seeking permission to initiate international airline service from Taiwan.	但在台灣要成立一家國際航空公司，政府仍然要求必須具備國際經驗與財力。
Upon receipt of regulatory approval, EVA Airways Corporation was formally established in March 1989.	在取得監管單位批准後，長榮航空正式於 1989 年 3 月成立。
The airline was originally to be called Evergreen Airways, however this was deemed too similar to the unrelated Evergreen International cargo airline.	長榮航空的英文公司名稱原本為 Everygreen Airways，但是這和不相關的 Evergreen International 空運公司過於接近。
In October 1989, the newly formed EVA Airways Corporation placed a US$3.6 billion order for 26 aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, including Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners.	1989 年 10 月，新成立的長榮航空，以 36 億美元向波音與麥道公司訂購 26 架飛機，包括波音 747-400 型與 MD-11。

First year revenues reached US$40 million.	頭一年的營收達 4000 萬美元。
In 1992, EVA Air received the first of its Boeing 747-400 aircraft on order, and launched its premium economy class, "Economy Deluxe", on its 747 transpacific flights to Los Angeles, beginning in December of that year.	1992 年，長榮航空訂購的第一架波音 747-400 型飛機交機，同時於該年 12 起在飛往洛杉磯的 747 航班中推出豪華經濟艙。

Internationally, EVA Air's rapid expansion and increased passenger volume was boosted by its safety record, in contrast to its primary competitor, China Airlines.	長榮航空由於優異的飛安記錄，特別是和主要競爭者華航相比，因此能夠在國際線上快速擴張，吸引大量乘客。
In addition to receiving IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) certification, EVA Air in 1997 achieved simultaneous official ISO 9002 certification in the areas of Passenger, Cargo, and Maintenance Services.	除了獲得 IOSA ( IATA 營運安全稽核）認證之外，1997 年長榮航空同時在客運、貨運與維修服務得到 ISO 9002 認證。

Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as hunter-gatherer societies.	發現的史前文物指出，高雄港在古代可能是個潟湖，原始居民可能主要是採獵社會。

The Dutch named the place Tankoya, and the harbor Tancoia.	荷蘭人稱之為 Tankoya 或 Tancoia 港。
The Dutch missionary François Valentijn named Takau Mountain "Ape Berg", a name that would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century.	荷蘭傳教士瓦倫丁將打狗山命名為「猴山」，且出現在 18 世紀的歐洲海圖之上。
Tankoia was located north of Ape's Hill and a few hours south from Tayouan (modern-day Anping, Tainan) by sail.	Takonia 位於猴山北邊，距大員（今台南安平）僅數小時航程。

In November 1901, twenty chō were established in total; Hōzan Chō (鳳山廳) was established nearby.	1901 年共新設 20 個廳，鳳山廳也在當時成立。

On this film Wei worked as an assistant director and worked with producer Jimmy Huang.	魏在這部片中擔任副導演，也與製片黃志明共事。
Their collaboration was important to Wei's career, as Huang would later produce Wei's Cape No.	他們的合作對魏的生涯很重要，黃後來成為《海角

Since 1996, Wei had been trying to make the war epic Seediq Bale, but he could not raise the funds.	1996 年起，魏就想要拍攝史詩戰爭片《賽德克・巴萊》，但募不到資金。
Double Vision's director, Chen Kuo-fu, suggested that he make a film that could win the people's trust.	《雙瞳》導演陳國富建議他，先拍一支能獲取眾人信心的電影。
In July 2004, Wei read about a Yunlin postman who successfully delivered a piece of mail addressed in the old Japanese style.	2004 年 7 月，魏讀到一篇故事，是說一個雲林的郵差，成功地將一封信寄到日本式老地址的故事。

As the production went over budget, Wei had problems securing additional capital; he then refinanced his home and put his family NTD 30 million (nearly USD 900,000) in debt before the release.	因為製作超出預算，魏無法取得後續資金，因此在電影發行前，魏抵押了自己的房子，而且讓家人背負台幣三千萬元（約 900,000 美元）債務。
During filming Wei could barely afford the film rolls and lodging for the crew.	拍攝期間魏幾乎付不出膠卷費用與工作人員的住宿費用。
Wei later said this film's zealous reception should help him manage his debts.	魏後來說，這部電影的瘋狂賣座，應該能讓他還清債務。
Wei believed "that the films that hit the screens before the end of summer vacation in 2007 were all 'safe bets'", because they avoided competition from Hollywood blockbusters.	魏相信「該片在 2007 年暑假結束前上片，是『打安全牌』，因為可以避開好萊塢賣座大片的競爭」。
Wei followed this theory when he released Cape No.	魏以同樣的想法，於 2008 年推出《海角
7 in 2008. Besides, Wei focused on the promotion of the film.	7 號》，並專注於推廣該片。

Also, Cape No. 7 earned Wei a subsidy of about NTD 100 million from Government Information Office.	《海角 7 號》同時也獲得行政院新聞局一億元新台幣的輔導金。
Seediq Bale was released in 2011, but Wei began to work on the film much earlier.	《賽德克・巴萊》於 2011 年上映，不過魏很早就開始籌拍本片。
According to an interview, Wei got the idea to make the film Seediq Bale in 1996 when he saw a protest demanding land to be returned to Taiwanese aborigines.	在一次訪談中指出1，魏在 1996 年看到一場台灣原住民爭取還我土地的抗議中，有了拍攝《賽德克・巴萊》的構想。
Wei began to study history relevant to the aborigines and decided to make a film about chief Mona Rudao.	魏開始研究台灣原住民史，決定要拍攝莫那魯道的故事。
In late 2003, Wei raised NTD 2.5 million and shot a five-minute demonstration film in order to further raise NTD 300 million (USD 10 million) to shoot the complete film.	2003 年末，魏集資新台幣 250 萬元，拍了一部 5 分鐘示範短片，希望能募得 3 億元資金（約 1000 萬美元）以完成該片。
The fundraising failed, and director Chen Kuo-fu advised Wei to make another film to win the trust of investors, so Wei turned his attention to make Cape No. 7.	募資失敗後，導演陳國富建議魏另外拍一部電影以說服投資人，因此魏轉而拍攝《海角 7 號》。
After the success of Cape No.	在《海角
7 in 2008 Wei returned to work on Seediq Bale.	7 號》於 2008 年大獲成功後，魏回頭開始籌拍《賽德克・巴萊》。
However, in 2009 Typhoon Morakot destroyed the set, and the cost grew from NTD 200 million to NTD 600 million.	然而，2009 年的莫拉克風災，摧毀了拍片場景，經費從 2 億元新台幣增加到 6 億元。
Aside from technical problems, Wei said that he had to direct the film and raise the money at the same time, and the company often ran out of money.	除了技術問題外，魏說他得一邊拍片，一邊籌款，公司經常沒有現金。
Wei said this made him nervous and grouchy, and he had to rely on the patience of the family and employees.	魏說這讓他不安且易怒，他必須依賴家人與員工的包容。

The film's title was inspired by the 52Hz whale, a creature dubbed the "world’s loneliest whale" because no other whales can hear its 52 Hz frequency calls.	該片片名來自一隻被稱為「世界最寂寞鯨魚的」 52Hz 鯨魚，因為其他鯨魚聽不到牠低達 52Hz 的呼聲。
As Wei said in a teaser, "Just like how no one hears this lonely whale, how many people have love inside of them but nobody knows?	魏在試片時說，「就像沒聽得到的寂寞鯨魚一樣，有多少人心中有愛卻無人得知？
Or simply need a chance to say ‘I love you’ and be heard?"	其實只需要一個說出『我愛你』而被聽到的機會？」

For a time, Gulangyu had the peculiarity of having constituted the only international settlement on Chinese soil apart from the more celebrated International Settlement at Shanghai.	有一段時間，鼓浪嶼的特色是成為中國在上海這個更加知名的公共租界外，中國土地上唯一的公共租界。
Soon after Xiamen became a treaty port resulting from China's loss in the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, foreign residents on the island established an informal organization that became formally organized several decades later when its Land Regulations were approved by the government of China in May 1902.	1842 年中國打輸第一次鴉片戰爭，簽下南京條約，使廈門成為通商口岸後，島上的外國居民成立了非正式的組織，而在數十年後的 1902 年 5 月政府核准該島的規範後，成為正式的組織。
Eventually 13 countries, including Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Japan, were to enjoy extraterritorial privileges there and take part in the Kulangsu Municipal Council that administered the settlement.	最終有 13 國，包括英國、法國、荷蘭、日本等，可以享有治外法權，在居地參與鼓浪嶼參議會。
As with the Shanghai International Settlement, the British played a predominant role in the administration and Sikh policemen from British India were charged with the policing of the Settlement under the Kulangsu Municipal Police.	如同上海公共租界，英國在行政方面扮演重要角色，派任英屬印度的錫克警察，受鼓浪嶼警局管轄，維持租界治安。
The consulates, churches, hospitals, schools, police stations, etc. built by those foreign communities explain the predominantly Victorian-era style architecture that can still be seen throughout Gulangyu.	由外國社區建立的領事館、教堂、學校、警察局等，是整個鼓浪嶼仍留存許多維多利亞時代風格建築的主因。
Japanese occupation of the island began in 1942, and lasted until the end of World War II.	日本自 1942 年起佔領該導，直到二戰後結束佔領。
The Hokkien dialect is spoken on the island, as it is in Xiamen.	由於位在廈門，該區的方言是福建話。
After the establishment of the PRC, Gulangyu was a district of Xiamen, one of four in the municipality not located on Xiamen Island until 2003.	在中華人民共和國建國後，鼓浪嶼在 2003 年之前，是廈門市的四個不在廈門島上的區之一。
In May of that year Gulangyu District was absorbed into Siming District, and has since been administered, policed, and adjudicated from Xiamen Island, just across the Lujiang River.	該年 5 月鼓浪嶼併入思明區，由就在鷺江河對面的廈門島管理行政、警務、司法。
Gulangyu is unique in China as a "traffic-free island".	鼓浪嶼是中國的「無車島」，十分特別。
It is connected to the main island of Xiamen only by ferry.	該島只透過渡輪連接廈門主島。
Neither cars nor bicycles are allowed, thus providing an alternative to the frenetic Xiamen Island across the river, although the recent introduction of electric tourist buggies may be damaging the island's charm.	汽車和自行車都禁行，對河對岸的人廈門島形成對比，但最近導入的電動旅遊車，可能降低該島的魅力。

Churches and museums were built, and people enjoyed going to music halls to hear performances.	到處建有教堂與博物館，民眾也喜歡到音樂廳聽音樂會。
Since then, the island's local cultural environment mingled with introduced foreign music and art, which is why the Gulangyu cultural scene differs from other parts of China.	之後該島的文化環境就融入了外來的音樂與藝術，也讓鼓浪嶼的文化風景與中國其他地方不同。
A number of China's most famous classical musicians come from Gulangyu, including the pianist Yin Chengzong, the violist Jing Yang, and the pianist Xu Feiping.	不少中國最知名的古典音樂家就來自鼓浪嶼，包括鋼琴家殷承宗、小提琴家楊璟、鋼琴家許斐平等。
Historically, Shu'an Zhou, Junji Lin, and Zuohuang Chen are other well-known classical musicians from the island.	其他該島出身的知名古典音樂家，還包括周淑安、Junji Lin、陳佐湟等人。
Gulangyu's piano ownership per capita ranks the first in nation, and by 2002, Gulangyu Island was given the name of "The Island of Music" by Chinese Musicians' Association.	鼓浪嶼的家戶鋼琴擁有台數是全中國第一，於 2002 年該島獲得中國音樂家協會頒給「音樂之島」頭銜。
The piano exhibition halls and museums and overall artistic atmosphere attract many musicians domestically and internationally.	鋼琴展示廳、博物館與整體的藝術氣息，吸引國內外許多音樂家。
The 580-seat Gulangyu Concert Hall is one of Fujian Province's most notable acoustic classical music venues.	擁有 580 席的鼓浪嶼是福建省最著名的古典音樂廳之一。

Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties.	自南北朝開始，中國就有了烤鴨。
A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor of China in the Yuan dynasty.	元朝時，有多種不同烤鴨呈獻給皇帝。
The dish, originally named "shāo yāzi" (燒鴨子), was mentioned in the Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages (飲膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen.	這道菜在 1330 年由飲膳太醫勿思慧撰寫的《飲膳正要》一書中名為「燒鴨子」。
The Peking Roast Duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming dynasty, and by then, Peking Duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus.	北平烤鴨之名在晚明一代逐漸發展起來，當時北平烤鴨是宮廷菜單上的一道主菜。
The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.	第一家專精北平烤鴨的餐廳便宜坊，於 1416 年成立於北京前口附近的鮮魚口。
By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish.	在清朝乾隆年間（1736-1796），北平烤鴨在上層階級開始普及，給了許多嗜食此物的詩人與文士許多靈感。
For instance, one verse of Dūmén zhúzhīcí, a Beijing local poem was, "Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig".	例如在《Dumen zhuzhici》中的一首北京當地詩句，就提到「以烤鴨和乳豬盛盤」。
In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing.	1864 年全聚德餐廳於北京成立。
Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks.	全聚德創始人楊全仁發明了烤鴨用的烘爐。
With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the Peking Duck to the rest of the world.	由於其創新與便於管理，該餐廳變得聞名全中國，且讓北平烤鴨之名傳遍世界。
By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike.	二十世紀中期，北平烤鴨已成為中國的象徵，受觀光客與外交人員喜愛。
For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China.	例如美國國務卿季辛吉，於 1971 年 7 月 10 日首次訪問中國時，在人民大會堂拜會周恩來。
After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite.	在早上一輪沒有結論的會談後，午餐的菜色是北平烤鴨，後來成為季辛吉的最愛。
The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972.	隔日發表中美聯合聲明，並邀請尼克森總統於 1972 年訪問中國。
Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck.	1976 年周恩來去世後，季辛吉再度訪問北京，享用北平烤鴨的美味。
Peking Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.	北平烤鴨，特別是全聚德的，已成為各國政要如卡斯楚、德國總理柯爾等人的最愛餐點。
Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.	北京最有名的兩家餐廳是全聚德與便宜坊兩家百年老店，不但街坊聞名，且各有特色：全聚德以其烘爐烤法聞名，便宜坊則使用閉爐古法。
Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water.	育肥的鴨隻，在屠宰後拔毛、取出內臟，並且以水完全洗淨。
Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat.	接著自頸部開孔，灌入空氣，以將皮肉分開。
The duck is then plunged in boiling water for 1 to 5 minutes, and then hung to dry.	接著將鴨過滾水約1到5分鐘，接著掛起晾乾。
This will tighten the skin and help the duck to achieve its traditional crispy texture.	這會讓鴨皮緊繃，以創造出傳統的鴨皮酥脆口感。
The duck is then glazed with a layer of potentially spiced and flavored maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water.	之後在鴨身抹上一層加有香辛料的麥芽糖漿，內部再以清水洗淨一次。
A marinade of traditional flavorings, including soy sauce and five-spice powder, and more maltose, is then applied inside the body cavity.	接著自鴨身開口處灌入含有醬油、五香粉、大量麥芽糖的傳統滷汁。
This will flavor the duck during the next step.	這樣在接下來的步驟中，即可讓鴨肉入味。
The duck is then left to dry for between 24 hours and several days in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator).	之後將鴨子置於乾冷處（或是冰箱內）存放 24 小時至數天，以便乾燥。
The drying allows the skin to crisp while roasting.	乾燥過程可讓鴨皮在烘烤時變得酥脆。
It is then roasted in an oven until the skin turns shiny brown.	接著放入爐中烘烤，烤到鴨皮變得油亮棕色為止。
While roasting, hot water is added to the body cavity as needed to ensure even cooking and tenderness.	烘烤時，必須將熱水注入鴨身中，以確保均勻烘烤，肉質柔軟。
Some preparations involve the duck being smoked with fruity woods.	需要準備一些果樹木頭來燻烤鴨身。
Besides traditional methods to prepare Peking Duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs around the world to produce the dish at home.	除了傳統北平烤鴨製法外，各國廚師也發明多種在家調理的食譜。
Peking duck is originally roasted in a closed oven (Chinese: 焖炉), and Bianyifang is the restaurant that keeps this tradition.	北平烤鴨傳統上使用燜爐來烤，便宜坊就是採取這種古法。
The closed oven is built of brick and fitted with metal griddles (Chinese: 箅子; pinyin: bì zi).	燜爐以磚塊砌成，內有金屬箅子。
The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang sorghum straw (Chinese: 秫秸; pinyin: shú jiē) at the base.	這種烤爐要在底部燃燒秫秸進行預熱。
The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven.	當火熄滅後，要立即將鴨子放入烤爐內，讓爐子內的餘熱緩緩將鴨子烤熟。
Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill.	主要的技巧是控制燃料與溫度。
In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.	以燜爐方式製作，鴨肉會與皮下脂肪結合，使得口感綿密而多汁。
The open oven (Chinese: 挂炉; literally: 'hung oven') was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty, and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain.	掛爐是在清宮御膳房中發展出來的，全聚德連鎖餐廳加以發揚光大。
It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees.	其設計可以透過燃燒桃樹或梨樹枝，一次烤 20 隻鴨。
The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270 °C (525 °F) for 30–40 minutes.	鴨子掛在爐火上的勾子，以攝氏 270 度（華氏 525 度）烤 30-40 分鐘。
While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals.	在烤鴨時，主廚會用一根桿子去晃每隻鴨子，讓鴨子接近爐火約 30 秒。
In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy, and can be eaten separately as a snack.	掛爐烤法中，脂肪會在過程中融化，皮會變得酥脆，可以另作為一道小點。
Almost every part of a duck can be prepared afterwards.	之後鴨子全身上下皆可食用。
Quanjude Restaurant served their customers the "All Duck Banquet" in which they cooked the bones of ducks with vegetables.	全聚德提供給顧客的「全鴨席」，包括佐以蔬菜的烤鴨骨。
The cooked Peking Duck is traditionally carved in front of the diners and served in three stages.	傳統上，烤好的鴨子會在客人面前片鴨，且分三次上菜。
First, the duck skin is served with sugar and garlic sauce as dip.	首先，鴨皮會和糖與蒜醬當做前菜。
The skin tastes better while remaining warm, but it will cool down fast.	鴨皮尚存餘溫時最為美味，不過很快就會冷掉。
The meat is then served with steamed pancakes (simplified Chinese: 春饼; traditional Chinese: 春餅; pinyin: chūn bǐng), spring onions and sweet bean sauce.	鴨肉會與蒸春餅、蔥與甜麵醬一同上菜。
Several vegetable dishes are provided to accompany the meat, typically cucumber sticks.	會有多種蔬菜與肉一同食用，通常是小黃瓜。
Some restaurants offer watermelon radish sticks as alternative.	其他餐廳會以紅心蘿蔔替代。
The diners spread sauce over the pancake.	食客要把醬汁淋上麵餅。
Traditionally, the pancake is wrapped around the meat and spring onion, then eaten by hand.	傳統上要以麵餅裹著鴨肉與蔥，以手持食用。
Cucumber sticks are eaten as refreshment between Peking Duck rolls, but can also be rolled in the pancake.	吃完鴨肉捲後，可以吃小黃瓜以去油，也可以捲進麵餅裡。
The remaining duck (鸭架) can be cooked in three ways.	剩下的鴨架有三種料理方式。
The traditional way is to be cooked into a broth.	傳統料理法是煮湯。
The meat together with bones can also be stir-fried with sweet bean sauce, or rapidly sautéed and served with salt and Sichuan pepper (椒鹽).	肉與骨會以甜麵醬拌炒，或是以四川椒鹽快炒。
Otherwise, they are packed up to be taken home by the customers.	此外，還可以讓顧客打包帶回家。
Whole Peking Ducks can be ordered as takeaways.	北平烤全鴨也可以外帶。
The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil.	帶回家的鴨子可以用烤爐回烤、火烤，或以熱油回溫。
When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of 150 °C (300 °F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160 °C (325 °F) for another 10 minutes.	使用烤箱的話，以攝氏 150 度（華氏 300 度）回烤 20 分鐘，再以攝氏 160 度（華氏 325 度）再烤 10 分鐘。  
The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70 cm (28 in) above the cooking fire.	火烤法要先將鴨肉注以滾水，然後上烤架，離火約 70 公分（28 英吋）。
The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot.	滾水每 3-4 分鐘要更換一次，直到鴨皮滾燙為止。
To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces and placed in a strainer held over a wok of boiling oil.	以油加熱北平烤鴨，鴨要先切成薄片，放在濾網上，很快過一鍋滾油。
The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.	鴨肉要在熱油中浸泡數次。
A number of restaurants in Beijing specialise in Peking Duck.	在北京有不少餐廳精於烤鴨。
Examples include Quanjude, Bianyifang, Changan Yihao (長安一號), Dayali, Beijing Xiaowangfu (北京小王府) and Dadong Kaoyadian (大董烤鴨店).	除了全聚德、便宜坊外，長安一號、大鴨梨、北京小王府、大董烤鴨店都相當知名。
Some restaurants, in particular Quanjude and Bianyifang, have long histories of serving high quality duck that they are now household names, or Lao zihao (老字號), literally "old brand name".	某些餐廳，尤其是全聚德和便宜坊，長期以來供應高級烤鴨，現在成為了「老字號」。
In addition, Quanjude has received worldwide recognition, having been named a China Renowned Trademark in 1999.	此外，全聚德在海外也相當知名，在 1999 年獲得中國馳名商標頭銜。
Crispy aromatic duck (香酥鴨 xiang su ya) is a similar dish to Peking duck.	香酥鴨是類似於北平烤鴨的菜色。
It is very popular in the United Kingdom, where it was created in the latter half of the twentieth century.	這道菜在英國相當流行，是於 20 世紀後半創造出來的。
The duck is first marinated with spices, then steamed until tender, and finally deep fried until crispy.	鴨子會先以香料滷汁浸泡，然後蒸熟，最後炸到酥脆。
The meat has less fat and is drier and crispier compared to that of Peking Duck.	和北平烤鴨相比，肉質比較不油、較乾脆。

CCCC's predecessors can be traced back to the Qing Dynasty, when the Junpu Engineering Bureau was established in 1905.	中國交通建設公司的前身可以追溯到清朝，於 1905 年設立的 Junpu 工程局。
The company was officially formed in 2005 by the combination of China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and China Harbour Engineering Co. (CHEC), which focus on transportation infrastructure and marine infrastructure, respectively.	2005年，分別著重於交通基建與港灣建設的中國路橋工程有限責任公司與中國港灣工程有限責任公司合併，該公司正式成立。
In 2006, the company listed shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, followed by a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2012.	2006年，該公司於香港證交所上市，之後於2012年與上海證交所上市。

A large dam across the Yangtze River was originally envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919.	橫跨長江的大水壩構想，最早出自1919年孫中山撰寫的《建國方略》。
He stated that a dam capable of generating 30 million horsepower (22 GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges.	他說可以在三峽下游建立水壩，能產生3,000萬馬力（22GW）。
In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges.	1932 年， 由蔣介石領導的國民政府，開始規劃三峽工程。
In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area.	1939年，日軍佔領宜昌，並且調查該區。
A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam in anticipation of a Japanese victory over China.	該設計「大谷計畫」將在日本擊敗中國後建成大壩。
In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation head design engineer, John L. Savage, surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'.	1944 年美國墾務主任設計工程師 John L. Savage 調查該區域，提出「長江計畫」大壩提案。
Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training.	約 54 名中國工程師赴美受訓。
The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next.	該大壩計畫原本打算採用一種獨特方法來移動船隻；船先開入低水位區與高水位區的水閘，然後以吊車與纜索將船移動到下一個水匣。
In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency.	如果是較小的船隻，可以編組同時移動，以提高效率。
It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods.	目前不知道考慮這種解決方案的原因，是為了要省水，還是因為工程師認為大壩高低差太大，其他方式不可行。
Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, in the midst of the Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.	當時已經完成探勘、調查、經費研究與設計工作，但因中國內戰打到一半，1947 年時政府停止該計畫。
After the 1949 Communist takeover, Mao Zedong supported the project, but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first, and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress.	1949 年共產黨奪權後，毛澤東雖然支持該計畫，但先進行附近的葛州壩計畫，而且因大躍進與文革造成的經濟問題，也拖延了計畫。
After the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, in 1956, Mao Zedong authored "Swimming", a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River.	1954 年長江洪災後，1956 年時毛澤東寫了《游泳》一詩，指出他對在長江築壩的執著。
In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.	1958 年百花齊放運動後，一些公開主張反對該計畫的人被捕入獄。
During the 1980s, the idea of a dam reemerged.	1980 年代，大壩計畫再度開始討論。
The National People's Congress approved the dam in 1992: out of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 abstained, and 25 members did not vote.	1992年人民大會通過大壩興建案，2,633 名代表中，1,767 名投贊成票，664 名反對，25 人未投票。
Construction started on December 14, 1994. The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but additional projects, such as the underground power plant with six additional generators, delayed full operation until May 2012.	建築工程自 1994 年 12 月 14 日開始。預計壩體於 2009 年可完全運作，但由於新增的計畫，例如地下水力發電廠新增六具發電機組，使完全運轉拖到 2012 年 5 月。
The ship lift was completed in 2015.	船塢於 2015 年完工。
The dam had raised the water level in the reservoir to 172.5 m (566 ft) above sea level by the end of 2008 and the designed maximum level of 175 m (574 ft) by October 2010.	大壩讓水庫水位於 2008 年底升至海拔 172.5 公尺（566 英呎），設計最高水位將於 2010 年 10 月到達 175 公尺（574 英呎）。

On completion, the reservoir flooded a total area of 632 km² (244 sq mi) of land, compared to the 1,350 km² (520 sq mi) of reservoir created by the Itaipu Dam.	完工後，水庫淹沒土地廣達 632 平方公里（244 平方英哩），而伊泰普水壩的庫區則為 1,350 平方公里（520 平方英哩）。
The government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180 billion yuan (US$22.5 billion).	政府估計三峽大壩工程將耗資 1,800 億元人民幣（225 億美元）。
By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan, among which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195 billion yuan on financing.	2008 年底，耗資將達 1,483.65 億元人民幣，其中 646.13 億元用於工程建設、685.57 億元用於受影響居民搬遷、151.95 億元用於財務。
It was estimated in 2009 that the construction cost would be recovered when the dam had generated 1,000 terawatt-hours (3,600 PJ) of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan.	2009 年時估計建設經費將在大壩發電達 1,000 太瓦時（3,600 皮焦耳）時損益兩平，收入將達 2,500 億元人民幣。
Full cost recovery was thus expected to occur ten years after the dam started full operation, but the full cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.	預計將在大壩完全運轉十年後完成弭平支出，實際上的支出完全弭平是在 2013 年 12 月 20 日。
Funding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, corporate bonds, and revenue from both before and after the dam is fully operational.	資金來源包括三峽大壩建設基金、葛州壩收益、自國家開發銀行的貸款、國內外商業銀行貸款、公司債，以及大壩完全運轉前後的收入。
Additional charges were assessed as follows: Every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam had to pay ¥7.00 per MWh extra.	另外也徵收下列費用：每個使用三峽大壩電力的省份，每百萬度電要支付人民幣 7 元。

Compared to using trucking, barges reduced carbon dioxide emission by ten million tonnes and lowered costs by 25%.	相較於卡車運輸，水運降低碳排達 1,000 萬噸，成本降低 25%。
Erosion in the reservoir, induced by rising water, causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface, including two incidents in May 2009 when somewhere between 20,000 and 50,000 cubic metres (26,000 and 65,000 cu yd) of material plunged into the flooded Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River.	水位上升造成的水庫侵蝕，經常產生大型崩塌，使得水庫表面發生可注意到的擾流，包括 2009 年 5 月的兩起事故，當時在某處有 2 萬到5 萬立方公尺（26,000 及 65,000 立方碼）的物體掉落至巫峽所在的烏江。
Also, in the first four months of 2010, there were 97 significant landslides.	而在 2010 年頭四個月，就發生 97 起大型山崩。
The dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around Chongqing and its suburban areas.	大壩也激發重慶及其郊區上游廢水處理的改善。
According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007, more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84 million tonnes per day, 65% of the total need.	根據環保部門統計，截至 2007 年 4 月，新增 50 處以上廢水處理廠，每日可處理 184 萬噸廢水，達需求的 65%。
About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5 tonnes of solid waste every day.	新增 32 處掩埋廠，每日可以處理 7,664.5 噸固體廢棄物。
Over one billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created.	每年有超過 10 億噸廢水注入河中，在水庫建成前必須掃除。
This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.	這會造成水流停滯、污染並且發黑。
In 1997, the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.	1950 年代三峽壩區原有 20% 造林地，1997 年降為 10%。
Research by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would, overall, gain about 6,000 km² (2,300 sq mi) of forest by 2008.	聯合國糧農組織的研究指出，亞太地區在 2008 年前的森林面積應增加 6,000 平方公里（2,300 平方英哩）。
That is a significant change from the 13,000 km² (5,000 sq mi) net loss of forest each year in the 1990s.	1990 年代，每年損失 13,000 平方公里（5,000 平方英哩）森林，這是很大的改變。
This is largely due to China's large reforestation effort.	主要來自中國大規模造林的努力。
This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it must restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.	在 1998 年長江洪災後，政府相信必須提高森林覆蓋，特別是長江上游三峽大壩區。
In 2010, NASA scientists calculated that shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the length of the Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles.	2010 年，NASA 科學家計算大壩儲存的水質量，會讓地球每天變長 0.06 微秒，讓地球中間變圓一點，兩極變扁一點。
An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze.	大壩一個重要功能是控制洪水，對長江是個季節性的問題。
Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river.	數百萬人居住在大壩下游，也有許多如武漢、南京、上海等臨河大城市。
Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.	大片農地和中國最重要的工業區都建於河邊。
The reservoir's flood storage capacity is 22 cubic kilometres (5.3 cu mi; 18,000,000 acre⋅ft).	水庫淹沒區的容量為 22 立方公里（5.3 立方英哩、18,000,000 立方英呎）

According to oral history, the plant and the jelly were named after the daughter of a Taiwanese tea businessman in the 1800s.	根據口述歷史，這種植物和果凍是以19世紀一位臺灣茶葉商人的女兒命名的。
The jelling property of the seeds was discovered by the businessman as he drank from a creek in Chiayi.	該商人在嘉義的一條小溪上喝水時，發現了這種種子可以結成果凍的特性。
He found a clear yellowish jelly in the water he was drinking and was refreshed upon trying it.	他在喝的水中發現了一種清澈的淡黃色果凍，嘗試後發現味道清新。
Looking above the creek he noticed fruits on hanging vines.	在小溪上方，他看到懸掛的藤蔓上有一種果實。
The fruits contained seeds that exuded a sticky gel when rubbed.	果實中含有種子，揉搓時會產生黏稠的凝膠。
Upon this discovery, he gathered some of the fruits and served them at home with honeyed lemon juice or sweetened beverages.	發現這點後，他收集了一些果實，並在家中用蜂蜜檸檬汁或甜味飲料一起食用。

The dry fruits can be sold as is, or dried aiyu seeds (Chinese: 愛玉子; pinyin: aiyu zi) can then be pulled off the skin and sold separately.	乾果可以按原樣出售，或者將乾愛玉子自果皮上取下另售。
The gelling agent in aiyu seeds is pectin.	愛玉子中的凝膠劑是果膠。
Pectines are located in the transparent layer on the surface of seeds and not the inside of seeds, which is why they are extracted by washing and rubbing instead of grounding to a powder.	果膠位於種子表面的透明層中，而不是種子內部，這就是為何要透過洗滌和摩擦取得，而非磨成粉末後再取出。
The main component of the water extract was found to be LMP (low methoxy pectin), as opposed to high metoxy pectins prevalent in commercially used sources such as apples or citrus peels.	水萃取物的主要成分是 LMP（低甲氧基果膠），而不是蘋果或柑橘皮等商用來源中普遍存在的高甲氧基果膠。
LMP gels in presence of divalent cations, which are found in sufficient amount in water (when it's not distilled), thus causing a creation of jelly.	LMP凝膠存在二價陽離子，這些陽離子在水中（未蒸餾時）有足夠的數量，因而生成果凍。

How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang dynasty, the area of modern-day Shanghai was under the sea level, so the land appeared to be literally "on the sea".	該名稱應如何解釋容有爭議，但中國歷史學者的結論是，在唐代時今上海所在地仍在海平面下，因此該地的出現確實「是在海上」。
Shanghai is officially abbreviated 沪 (Hù/Vu²) in Chinese, a contraction of 沪渎 (Hù Dú/Vu Doh, lit "Harpoon Ditch"), a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.	上海的中文官方簡稱為「滬」，是滬瀆的簡寫，約 4-5 時紀時晉朝女一將蘇州河口以此為名，當時是注入海中的主要河道。

During the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town (青龍鎮) in modern Qingpu District was a major trading port.	在唐宋時期，青浦區的青龍鎮是主要貿易港口。
Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang Tianbao era), it developed into what historically called a "giant town of the Southeast", with thirteen temples and seven pagodas.	該地設立於746年（唐天寶五年），發展成為歷史上所謂的「東南大城鎮」，擁有十三座寺廟和七座寶塔。

By the end of the Song dynasty, the center of trading had moved downstream of the Wusong River to Shanghai.	到宋朝末期，貿易中心已經沿吳淞江下游移到上海。
It was upgraded in status from a village to a market town in 1074, and in 1172, a second sea wall was built to stabilize the ocean coastline, supplementing an earlier dike.	1074年，其地位從村莊升格為一個城鎮，1172年，在原先的堤防外建興建了第二道海堤，以確保海岸線穩定。
From the Yuan dynasty in 1292 until Shanghai officially became a municipality in 1927, central Shanghai was administered as a county under Songjiang Prefecture, which had its seat in the present-day Songjiang District.	從1292年的元朝到1927年上海正式成為市鎮，上海中部由松江縣管轄，松江縣位於今日的松江區。
Two important events helped promote Shanghai's development in the Ming dynasty.	於明朝發生的兩起重要事件，對促進上海的發展有功。
A city wall was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by Japanese pirates.	1554年首次修建城牆，以保護該鎮免於倭寇襲擊。
It measured 10 m (33 ft) high and 5 km (3 mi) in circumference.	城牆高10米（33英尺），周長5公里（3英里）。
A City God Temple was built in 1602 during the Wanli reign.	1602年萬曆年間，市區內興建一座神廟。
This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai.	通常只有縣的首府可以建廟，通常不會讓上海這樣的小城建廟。
Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.	學者認為，這可能反映了該鎮的經濟重要性，而非其較低的政治地位。
During the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (江海关; see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade.	清朝期間，由於兩個重要的中央政府政策變化，上海成為長江三角洲地區最重要的海港之一：1684年，康熙皇帝廢除明朝對遠洋船隻的禁令，這項禁令自1525年以來一直有效；1732年，乾隆皇帝將江蘇省海關辦公室（江海關；見上海海關總署）從松江縣首府遷至上海，並賦予上海對江蘇對外貿易海關收繳關稅的專屬控制權。
As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.	由於這兩項關鍵決定，上海到1735年成為整個長江下游地區的主要貿易港口，雖然在政治制度中仍處於最低的行政等級。
In the 19th century, international attention to Shanghai grew due to European recognition of its economic and trade potential at the Yangtze.	在19世紀，由於歐洲發現上海在長江的經濟和貿易潛力，國際社會對上海的注意力愈來愈大。
