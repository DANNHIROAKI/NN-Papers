# **POEM**: Human **PO**se **EM**bedding

We target learning representations/embeddings for 3D human poses from their 2D projections, including:

* **`Pr-VIPE`**: Learning a view-invariant probabilistic pose embedding space. [[`ECCV'20 paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01001)][[`IJCV'21 paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13321)][[`website`](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/pr-vipe/home)]
* **`CV-MIM`**: Learning disentangled view-invariant pose representations and view representations. [[`CVPR'21 paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01405)]

## Getting Started
The installation requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) pre-installed.
Please refer to [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/poem/requirements.txt) and
[`run.sh`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/poem/run.sh)
for how to install the required packages.

**Note:** The [`run.sh`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/poem/run.sh) script only provides a sample
command for how to launch a training job on a small dummy data table. Running it
as is does NOT launch training job on any real datasets or generate any
meaningful model checkpoints.

This repository is organized with the following folders:

* [`pr_vipe`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/poem/pr_vipe): Pr-VIPE project code.
* [`cv_mim`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/poem/cv_mim): CV-MIM project code.
* [`core`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/poem/core): Common utility libraries.
* [`tools`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/poem/tools): Common utility tools.
* [`testdata`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/poem/testdata): Data for code testing (not for real training/evaluation).
* [`doc`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/poem/doc): Documentation files.
