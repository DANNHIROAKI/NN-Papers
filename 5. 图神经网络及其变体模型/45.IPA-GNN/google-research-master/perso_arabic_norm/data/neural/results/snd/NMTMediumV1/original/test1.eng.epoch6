Allah is the All-Merciful, the All-Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
The Lord of the Day of Judgment
You worship us, and we ask for help.
Guide us to the Straight Path.
The path of those whom You have favoured, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who are astray.
Alif Lam Mim.
This is the Book in which there is no doubt, and a guidance for those who fear Allah.
Who believe in the unseen, and establish regular prayers, and spend out of what We have given them,
And who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was sent down before you, and they are certain of the Hereafter.
These are on guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.
As for those who disbelieve, it is not for them whether you warn them or warn them not; they will not believe.
God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil, and there is a great punishment for them.
And there are some people who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they are not believers.
They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none except themselves, and they do not perceive.
In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has increased their disease, and they will have a painful punishment for them.
And when it is said to them: Make not mischief on the earth, they say: We are but reformers.
Nay, they are the corrupters, and they do not understand.
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have believed?" But they are not aware, but they know.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, "Indeed, we are with you; we were only mocking."
Allah mocks them, and they wander in their rebellion in their rebellion.
These are the ones who have purchased error for guidance, so their trade has not earned them, nor were they guided.
Their likeness is as a likeness of one who kindled a fire, and when it illuminated it, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, and they did not see.
deaf, dumb, deaf, and they will not return.
"Or it is like the sky that fall down in darkness, thunder and lightning, and they press their fingers in their ears in their ears, and they fear the death of death; and Allah loves the disbelievers.
The lightning almost snatches away their eyes, but when it reaches them, they will fall into it, and when it comes to them, they stand up; and if Allah willed, He will have their eyes and their eyes; surely Allah has power over all things.
O mankind, worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous.
Who has made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy, and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth therewith fruits for your sustenance; then do not set up rivals to Allah in worship.
And if you are in doubt concerning what We have sent down to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses besides Allah if you are truthful.
But if ye cannot, and of a surety ye cannot, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, which is prepared for those who reject Faith.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow, and they will say: "This is what we have given us before." They say: "This is what we have given us before." They will be given for them, and they will live therein.
Allah does not suffice a gnat like a gnat or a gnat. But those who believe know that they know that it is the truth from their Lord. Those who disbelieve say: "What is the matter with Allah?" But those who disbelieve say, "What is the matter with Allah? He causes many of them astray. He causes many of them astray. He will not guide you with the transgressors."
Those who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the land; they are the losers.
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were dead and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will cause you to die, and then to Him you shall be returned.
It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth; then He raised them into the heavens; then He gave them the seven heavens; and He has knowledge of all things.
When your Lord said to the angels, "I am going to place a vicegerent on earth," they said, "Will you place someone who will cause corruption therein and shed blood while we glorify Your praise?" He said, "I do not know what you do.
And He taught Adam all the names; then He presented them to the angels and said: "Tell me the names of these if you are truthful."
They said: "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge save what You have taught us; surely You are the Knowing, the Wise."
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names; and when he had informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not tell you of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you conceal and what you reveal?"
And (remember) when We said to the angels, "Prostrate before Adam," but they prostrated themselves except Iblis, and he was arrogant, and he was arrogant.
And We said: O Adam! dwell thou, O Adam, and thy wife in Paradise, and eat therefrom, and eat therefrom, and do not approach this tree, lest ye be of the unjust.
Then Satan made it slip from them, and they were expelled from what they were in, and We said to them, "Get down from it, some of you, and you will be enemies of one another, and there is a provision for you in the land."
Adam received from his Lord a word from his Lord, and He accepted his repentance. He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
We said, "Get down from it all of you, then when there comes to you guidance from Me, and whoever follows My guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve."
But those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they shall be the dwellers of the Fire, abiding therein forever.
O Children of Israel, remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil My covenant with Me, and I will fulfil your covenant with you, and fear Me alone.
And believe in what I have sent down confirming you (O Muhammad SAW), confirming that which is in the Torah (Torah) and be not the first to deny it (i.e. Paradise), and do not exchange My Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) for My sake (i.e. Paradise).
And do not confound the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth while you know.
And establish prayer and give Zakat and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin mankind to do good deeds and forget your own parts while you recite the Book? Will you not then understand?
And seek help with patience and prayer, and indeed, it is for those who are humble by the humbly of the humble.
Those who think that they will meet their Lord and to Him they shall return.
O Children of Israel, remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you above the nations.
And guard yourselves against a Day when no soul shall avail another, nor shall intercession be accepted from her, nor shall intercession be accepted from her, nor shall they be helped.
And remember when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who were afflicting you with the torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women. That was a great trial from your Lord.
And when We parted the sea for you, and saved you, and drowned Pharaoh and drowned the people of Pharaoh.
And (remember) when We appointed for Musa (Moses) forty nights (for forty nights), then you took the calf (for worship) after calf, and you were Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).
Then We pardoned you so that you may be grateful.
And (remember) when We gave Musa the Book and the Criterion that you may be guided aright.
And (remember) when Musa said to his people: O my people! worship Allah, for the calf they have wronged you. So turn ye back to your Maker, and slay yourselves, that He may be better for you. He has mercy on you, and He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
And (remember) when you said: O Musa! we will not believe in you until we see Allah, until the thunderbolt overtook you while you were mocking.
Then We raised you up after your death, that you may be grateful.
And We made shade with you (O Muhammad SAW), and We sent down to you manna and quails, and said: Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and they wronged not themselves.
And (remember) when We said: Enter this city and eat therefrom therefrom, and eat of it wherever you desire, and enter the gate bowing humbly, and say: "We shall forgive your sins from your sins, and do good for the good."
But those who were unjust to the wrong-doers changed that which they had said, so We sent down upon them a sky from heaven from heaven.
And (remember) when Musa (Moses) prayed for water for his people, We said: "Strike the rock with your staff"; and twelve springs gushed forth from twelve springs, and every people knew its drinking-drinking.
And when they said, "O Moses, do not be patient for the sake of Moses, when we have patience from your Lord, and the earth, and the earth, and its garments, and its garments, and its ears, and its eyes, and their ears, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their eyes, and their livestock, and their ears, and their blood, and their blood.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you and raised above you the Mount (saying): "Hold fast to what We have given you and remember what is in it that you may be godfearing."
Then you turned away after it had not been for Allah's grace and His mercy on you, and that you would have been lost.
And you were aware of those who transgressed among you in the Sabbath, so We said to them: Be ye apes, despised and hated.
So We made it a sign for them, and a sign, and a lesson for those who fear Allah.
And when Moses said to his people, "Allah commands you to slaughter a cow." They said, "Are you mocking us?" He said, "I seek refuge with Allah from the ignorant."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what she has said, and He said, 'It is not a cow nor a cow.' He said, "He is not a cow, nor is he a cow."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make clear to us what colour is." He said, "He is a yellow yellow-yellow cow." He said, "He is a yellow yellow-yellow cow."
They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make clear to us what is like us, and we are like to be like us. If Allah wills, we will be guided."
He said, "He is a cow, nor a cow, nor the garden, nor the fields, nor the fields." They said, "You have brought it a cow." They said, "You have come to come, so they did not have it."
And when you killed a man, then disputed about yourselves, and Allah is clear to what you hide.
So We said: Strike the Strike of the cow, then Allah gives life to the dead, and He shows you His signs, so that you may understand.
Then after that, your hearts were hardened, as if they were like them, and if they were split out of water, even though some of them are split out of water, and some of them are split out of water; and some of them are water from Allah; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Have you then hope that you will not hope for him when a party of them have heard the word of Allah, then they have understood it after they had understood it?
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when they meet each other with each other, they say, "Do you tell them what God has revealed to you?
Do they not know that Allah knows what they hide and what they reveal?
And there are some among them who know not the Book of the Book, but they do not know the Book, but they are only conjecture.
Woe to those who write their hands in the Book, and they say, "This is from Allah," so that it may be for them a small price, so woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they used to earn.
And they say: The Fire will not touch us but for a few numbered days. Say: Have you taken a covenant from Allah, that Allah will not break His promise, or that you do not know?
Nay, those who do evil, and their deeds will be the inmates of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
But those who believe and do good works, they are the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein forever.
And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (saying): "Worship none but Allah, and do good to parents, and to the parents and the needy, and the orphans, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, then you turn away.
And (remember) when We took a covenant with you (saying): Shed not your blood, nor shed your dwellings from your homes, and then you (O Muhammad SAW) bear witness to your homes, then you are witnesses.
Then you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Ye shall be among the people of your people, and a party among his people, and there is no one among them who has overcome it, and some of them are some of them. Among them are some of them, and some of them, from among them, from among them, and from among them, that they may turn away from it; and if ye do not believe, it is only in the life of the world, and the punishment of the Day of Judgment."
These are the ones who buy the life of this world for the Hereafter, so their punishment will not be lightened, nor shall they be helped.
And We gave Musa the Book, and after him followed messengers after him, and We gave Jesus the son of Mary clear proofs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit, and when a Messenger came to you with what your souls did not desire, you were insolent.
And they say: Our hearts are hardened in their hearts; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they will believe.
And when there came to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is with them, and that which came before them, they sought to help the disbelievers, but when they come to them, they rejected what they did; and Allah is the curse of the unbelievers.
Evil is that which they have sold down in Allah's cause, that they may deny what they have sent down. Allah has sent down His mercy upon His servants whom He wills of His servants; so they have incurred wrath upon wrath upon wrath; and for the unbelievers there is a disgraceful punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us." But they disbelieve in what is with them, and they disbelieve in what is with them. Say: "What is the matter of Allah?" Say: "What is the matter of Allah's messengers?"
Moses came to you with clear proofs, and you did not worship the calf, and you were unjust.
And when We took a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, [saying], "Hold fast to what We have given you, and hear," and they said, "We hear," and they said, "We hear," and their hearts disbelieved. Say, "What is the matter for you that you have faith?"
Say: “If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and others for others, then long for death if you are truthful.”
And they will not wish for it, for they will not avail it for what their hands have sent before, and Allah knows the wrongdoers.
And you will surely find them more than the people of the people, and the idolaters, and those of them who are idolaters. Each one of them will be given a life of a thousand years, but he will not be able to save him from a thousand years. And Allah sees what they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (Gabriel), he has sent down to your heart (the Qur'an) from Allah, confirming what is before it (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel), and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers.
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael, then surely Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.
And We have sent down to you clear Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and none will deny them except the transgressors.
But when they have made a covenant, some of them will be a party of them, but most of them do not believe.
And when a messenger came to them from Allah, confirming what is with them, a party of those who were given the Book behind the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they had not known.
They were followed to follow the footsteps of those who were following the devils, and Satan did not reject them, but the devils were averse to the magic of the people, and they were given to the two of them, and when they were given to the angels, they were commanded to be in the hands of Allah, and they were not given to them.
And if they had believed and feared Allah, it would be better for them, if they only knew.
O you who believe! Do not say, "Do not say," and say, "Say," and listen, and the disbelievers will have a painful punishment.
The People of the Book (Jews and Christians) are not of the unbelievers, nor the idolaters, nor any other than that which you have sent down from your Lord, but Allah chooses to show mercy to whom He pleases; and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
Whatever We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one to be better or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?
Do you not know that Allah is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that you have no protector or helper?
Would you ask your Messenger (O Muhammad SAW), if he was asked of Musa (Moses)? But he who disbelieved (in disbelief) has gone astray, and he who disbelieves (in disbelief) has gone astray from the Path (i.e. the disbelievers).
Many of the People of the Book wish that they would turn away from you after you have believed after their belief has become clear to them, so forgive them and forgive them, until Allah has sent down His command. Allah has power over all things.
And perform the prayer and pay the alms, and whatever good you have done before you, you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah sees all that you do.
They say, "None will enter Paradise unless they be Jews or Christians." Say, "If you are truthful, then you are truthful." Say, "Produce your proof, if you are truthful."
Nay, whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he is a doer of good, his reward is with his Lord, and there shall be no fear for them nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians are nothing but the Christians," and the Christians say, "The Jews do not follow anything." Those who recite the Book say, "These are the ones who do not know what they say." Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they used to differ.
And who is more unjust than he who forbids the name of Allah in His name, seeking His name to His remembrance? But they are not afraid of them in fear, but they will not enter it in fear. For them is a disgrace in this world, and in the hereafter they have a grievous chastisement.
To Allah belongs the East and the West. So wherever you turn back, then Allah is the All-Embracing, the All-Knower.
And they say: Allah has taken a son for Himself. Glory be to Him, and He is the All-Knower of all that is in the heavens and on earth, and all that is in the earth.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decrees, He says to it, "Be," and it is.
And those who do not know, say, "Why does Allah not speak to us?" But when a sign came to us, they said, "It is not a sign to come to us." They said, "Their hearts are like their hearts. We have indeed made clear signs for people who believe."
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) with truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a Warner, and you will not be questioned about the dwellers of the blazing Fire.
And the Jews shall not be with you, nor shall they follow you until they follow your religion. Say: "Allah's guidance is guided by the guidance of Allah, and has knowledge of knowledge. If you follow their desires, then you will have no protector nor helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book (the Qur'an) are recited to it (the Qur'an), and they believe in it (the Qur'an). They believe in it (the Qur'an), and they do not believe in it.
O Children of Israel, remember My favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you over the nations.
And guard yourselves against a Day when no soul shall avail another, nor shall intercession be accepted from her, nor shall intercession be accepted from him, nor shall they be helped.
And when Ibrahim (Abraham) tried to test his Lord with certain commands, he fulfilled them, and said: "I am going to give you a place for mankind." He said: "I will surely be my son." He said: "This is not my duty to do wrong."
And when We made a place for mankind for the people and the sanctuary, and We made it a place of prayer for the prayer of Abraham, and We made Abraham a place of prayer for the House, and We enjoined the House, and those who bow prostrate, and those who bow prostrate, and those who bow prostrate.
And (remember) when Ibrahim said: "My Lord, make this a City of security, and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day." He said: "I give him enjoyment for a little while, and I will give him a share of the torment of the Fire.
And (remember) when Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma'il (Ishmael), raising the foundations of the House (Ishmael), (saying): "Our Lord! accept from us from this (service) from us: surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing."
"Our Lord, make us submissive to Him, bowing to our progeny, bowing to our progeny, bowing to Him, bowing to us, and forgive us, for Thou art the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Our Lord, raise amongst them a messenger from among themselves who will recite to them Your signs and teach them the Book and the Wisdom and purify them. You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And who has lost the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) except for the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham), but We indeed made him in this world (i.e. the world of Islamic Monotheism), and verily, We gave him (this world) in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds."
And they enjoined on Ibrahim sons and Ya'qub (Ya'qub), so that Allah (Allah) has chosen for you the religion (i.e. Allah's religion): "O my sons! Allah has chosen for you, and do not die except as Muslims."
Have you considered the death when death came to you, when he said to his children, "Will you worship me after me?" They said, "We shall worship your God and Isaac and Isaac and Isaac and Isaac. To Him we are Muslims."
This is a nation that has passed away, and you will not be asked for what they have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they did.
They say, "Be Jews or Christians, you will be guided." Say, "We follow the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the idolaters."
Say: "We believe in Allah and in that which has been revealed to us and that which was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Isaac and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses from their Lord, and that which was given to them from the prophets, and that which was given to them from their Lord, we are indeed Muslims."
But if they believe in you as they believe, they are indeed on the right path; but if they turn away, they are in schism; but if they turn away, then Allah will suffice you against them; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Allah (SWT) is the one who is the one who is better, and who is better than Allah? And we worship Him.
Say: Do you dispute with us about Allah, He is our Lord and your Lord, and we shall have our deeds and your deeds and you shall have your deeds?
Or do you say that Ibrahim (Ishmael), Isaac and Ya'qub (Isaac), and Ya'qub (Jacob), and the Christians, and the Christians, and the Christians (Jews and Christians), or Christians (or Christians)? Say: "Who is the best of Allah? Who is more unjust than he who conceals him? And Allah is not unaware of what you do."
This is a nation who have passed away from it, and for what they have earned, and for you is what you have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they did.
The people will say, "What has they turned away from them?" Say, "To Allah belong the East and the West." Say, "To Allah belong the East and the west. He guides whom He wills."
Thus We have made you a community, that ye may be a witness against mankind, and the Messenger is a witness over yourselves, and the Messenger is a witness over you, and that we may not be made to be a witness to the Prophet; but if he turn away, he will save those who follow him; but Allah is most gracious to all mankind.
We have seen your vision in heaven, so We shall turn you back to the qiblah of the Sacred Mosque. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and you will be left to your turn towards the Sacred Mosque, and you will be left to your return, and those who were given the Book know that it is the truth from their Lord. Allah is not aware of what they do.
And if you were to bring the Book to them all, they would not follow your qiblah, nor would they follow your qiblah, nor will they follow your qiblah; nor are they to follow their religion after the knowledge of their religion; and if you follow their desires, then you will be wrongdoers.
Those who gave the Book to the Book, they recognize their sons, but some of them know the truth, and some of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of the disputers.
And every one has a direction to which he turns to, and then hasten to the good works, wherever Allah will bring you together; surely Allah has power over all things.
And wherever you are expelled, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and it is the truth from your Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And wherever you are, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn to the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you turn back, then turn back to their return, so that some of them are unjust to them, and do not fear them, but do not fear them, so that you may be guided.
Similarly, We have sent among you a Messenger from among yourselves reciting to you Our verses and purifying you, and teaching you the Book and the Wisdom, and teaches you that which you did not know.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful to Me.
O you who believe! Seek help in patience and prayer; surely Allah is with the patient.
"And say not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead; nay, they are alive, but ye perceive not.
And We will certainly test you with fear and hunger, and from wealth and loss, and lives with fruits and lives, and give glad tidings to the patient.
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: "To Allah we belong and to Him we shall return."
They are those on whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy, and they are the ones who are guided.
Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah, and those who are near to Allah's House, or the pilgrimage (i.e. the pilgrimage), there is no blame for them in the House of Allah; and whoever does good, it is no blame for him; and whoever does good, then Allah is All-Knowing, All-Knowing.
Those who have been given the truth and the guidance, We have made it clear to them, and We have made them clear in the Book, and they will curse them against the curse of Allah.
Except for those who repent and amend and make amends, then I will turn away from them, and I am Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, Allah will curse them with the curse of Allah and the angels and all mankind.
They shall abide therein forever, and shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be reprieved.
And your God is One God, there is no god but He, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
He created the heavens and the earth in the heavens and the earth, and the night, and the day, and the day, and the ships, and the ships, and the ships, and the sea, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, in the midst of the earth. In that are signs for people who reflect.
And among mankind are those who worship Allah as they love themselves as they love Allah. But those who believe are in Allah's love, and those who believe, if they are wrong-doers, know that they are in the sight of Allah; and if they do wrong, then surely Allah is severe in retribution.
But when those who followed those who followed themselves will be humbled, and they will see the punishment, and their ties will be cut off.
And those who followed will say: "If we had been returned to us, we would certainly have taken them away from us." So Allah will show them their deeds for their deeds, and they will not be able to escape the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is in the earth and eat of what is in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; he is your open enemy.
He only enjoins you to commit indecency and indecency, and that you say about Allah what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say, "We shall follow what we found our fathers following." Even though their fathers had not known, they were not guided.
And the parable of those who disbelieve is like one who shouts to the One who hears nothing but calls, but nothing but cries, deaf, deaf, deaf, and dumb.
O you who believe! eat of the good things which We have provided for you and give thanks to Allah, if it is Him that you worship.
Allah has forbidden for you only flesh, flesh, and blood, and swine, and swine, and swine, that which is forbidden to you, and that which is not due to Allah, nor of the limits, nor of the limits, nor of the limit, for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who conceal the Book of Allah (i.e. the Qur'an) which they have sent down (from the Book), and exchange for a small price for it (i.e. the Qur'an), except for the Fire (i.e. Paradise), but Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
They are the ones who have purchased error in exchange for guidance, and for forgiveness for forgiveness.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) with truth, and the Book (the Qur'an) among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) are in extreme opposition (to the Book).
The good is not for your parents and to the West, nor to the west, and for the good, in Allah and the Last Day, and the angels and the angels, and the angels and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the prophets, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and those who are in the cause of Allah, are the truthful.
O you who believe! The enemy has been given to you against the enemy, and the wife of the wife of old wife, and a wife whose wife is a wife, and he is a wife to his brother; and if his brother reaches him to his brother, he will be better for his brother. That is a mercy from your Lord, and there is a painful punishment from your Lord.
And there is life for you in this life, that you may be godfearing.
When death approaches one of you, if he leave any goods of his parents, then he bequeath to you parents and relatives, according to reasonable usage.
But whoever changes it after he has heard it, it is only for those who change it; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
But if any one is forced to forgive the testator or the testator, and that which is wrong, there is no sin for him, for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.
O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may attain piety.

And We sent to the Children of Israel, (saying): "I have brought you a sign from your Lord, and I have brought you a sign from your Lord, and (so) He will be like a man from the dust of the Fire." And he will say to them, "This is the command of Allah. He will make clear to you the dead of the dead, and He will inform you of what you are in your minds. And you are in the believers.
And I have come to know that which was before me of the Torah, and that I may make lawful to you some of that which is lawful to you, and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me.
God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path.
But when Jesus had disbelieved in their disbelief, he said: "Will you be my helpers to Allah?" The disciples said: "We are helpers for Allah. We believe in Allah and bear witness that we are Muslims."
Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger; write us down among the witnesses.
And they devised, and Allah planned, and Allah is the best of schemers.
When Allah said, "O Jesus, I will raise you to Myself and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection.
As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.
But as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their rewards in full, and Allah does not love the unjust.
That is what We recite to you and the Book and the wisdom.
“The likeness of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, ‘Be”, and he was.”
This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.
And if any knowledge has come to you concerning what knowledge has come to you, say, "Come, then let us go to our sons, and your sons and your women and your women and your women and your women; we pray for God, the curse of the liars."
There is no god but Allah, and Allah is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
But if they turn away, Allah knows the evil-doers.
Say: "O people of the Book (Jews and Christians) come to common terms between us and you that we worship none but Allah, that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah."
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Ibrahim, when not the Torah and the Gospel had been sent down after him? Will you not then understand?
These are those who have argued about that which you have knowledge of, while you do not dispute about what you have given, and Allah knows that you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian, but he was a man of faith, and he was not of the idolaters.
The people of Abraham are those who follow him, who follow him and his messenger and those who believe, and Allah is the guardian of the believers.
A group of the People of the Book would wish to lead you astray, but they mislead none but themselves, and they do not perceive.
O People of the Book, why do you not believe in Allah's signs while you are witnesses?
O People of the Book, why do you clothe the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?
And some of the People of the Book say: "Believe in the morning that has been sent down to the believers, and disbelieve in it, that they may turn away from it, and that they may turn away."
And do not believe in any one who follows your religion, and say, “The guidance are guided by Allah.” Say, “Do not believe in that which is given to you.
He grants mercy on whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.
Among the People of the Book are some of whom you have given a wealth of wealth, if if you are with them, he will not leave you with them, and some of them will not leave it unless you are with them. That is because they say, "We have no power over us." That is because they say, "We have no power over us, and they are liars."
Nay, but whoever fulfills his covenant and fears Allah, then surely Allah loves those who fear Him.
Those who sell the covenant with Allah and their oaths for a small price, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter, nor will Allah speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.
Among them are a group who distort the Book with their tongues, so that you may think that it is not in the Book, and they say, "This is from Allah," and they say, "This is from Allah, and it is not from Allah."
It is not for any human being that Allah has given him the Book, and the Prophethood and the Prophethood, and then he will say to mankind: "Worship me, my Lord and the Lord of the worlds."
And He will not enjoin you to worship the angels and the prophets in order that you should be devoted to Allah. Will you then be Muslims?
And when Allah took the covenant of the prophets, saying: I have given you the Book and Wisdom, then come to you a Messenger confirming what is with you, and you must believe in him and you will help him.
But whoever turns away from it, they are the transgressors.
Do they seek other than the religion of Allah, and whatever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, willingly and unwillingly, and to Him shall they return?
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "We have believed in Allah and in what has been sent down to us and what is revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Isaac and Isaac and the tribes, and what was given to Moses from their Lord, and that we may not make any distinction between any of them."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.
How will Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief after they disbelieved, and that they bear witness that the Messenger is the truth, and Allah does not guide the unjust people?
These are the ones who will be on the curse of Allah upon them, and of the angels and of all mankind.
They shall abide therein, and shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be reprieved.
But if anyone compels them and do righteous deeds, then surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who disbelieve after their belief, then increase in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted, and they are indeed lost.
As for those who disbelieve and die while they die, they shall not be accepted from the earth, even if they offer it ransom for ransom. They shall have a painful torment, and they shall have no helpers.
By no means shall you attain righteousness until you love of that which you love, and whatever you spend, Allah knows it well.
All food were lawful to the Children of Israel, except what was revealed to the Children of Israel. Say: "Bring the Torah, if you are truthful." Say, "If you are truthful?"
But whoever forges a lie against Allah, then they are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers).
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) Hanifa (Islamic Monotheism).
Verily, the first House appointed for mankind was appointed at Bakkah, blessed and a guidance for the worlds.
There are signs in the signs of Abraham, which is a place of security; and whoever enters it is secure, and pilgrimage for the pilgrimage is for the House of Allah; and for those who disbelieve, there is no god but Allah, and who disbelieves in it, surely Allah is Independent of the worlds.
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in Allah's signs, and Allah is Witness of what you do?"
Say, "O People of the Book, why do you hinder those who believe from Allah's way, seeking to hinder them from the path of Allah? But you are only aware of what you do, and Allah is not unaware of what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey a group of the People of the Book, then they will turn you back after you have believed.
How can they disbelieve, when you are recited to Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW) is in you, and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW) is in you, and Allah has guided him to a Straight Path.
O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims.
And hold fast to the rope of Allah, that ye may be divided, and not divided up in the remembrance of Allah; and remember the favour of Allah upon you when ye were enemies, and He made your hearts to be brothers, and ye were brothers of the pit of Fire; so Allah made clear to you His signs, so that ye may be guided.
And there shall be a party among you who call to good deeds, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and they are the successful.
And be not like those who are divided among themselves and fall into disputations after receiving clear proofs, for them is a great punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be black, and some faces will be black, and those whose faces are black will be black: “Did you reject your faith after you disbelieved?” Then taste the torment for the disbelievers.
And those whose faces are white, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the Signs of Allah, We rehearse them to you in truth; and Allah does not desire to do injustice to the creatures.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and to Allah is the final return.
You are the best of the good people, as you have created, and forbid what is right, and you believe in Allah and believe in Allah; and if the People of the Book had believed, it would be better for them, and most of them are transgressors.
They will not hurt you aught but harm, but if they fight you, they will turn their backs on you, and they will not be helped.
They will be afflicted with a place except by God's people, except for the people, and from the people. They have incurred the wrath of Allah upon them, and they have incurred the calf. That is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah, and they kill the prophets. That is because they disobeyed the communications of Allah, and they are transgressors.
They are not all alike, the People of the Book, a group of the People of the Book, who rehearse the verses of Allah during periods of the night and in the night.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and forbid what is wrong, and they are the ones who are the righteous.
And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it; God knows the godfearing.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them aught against Allah. They are the companions of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
That is as the likeness of the world in this world's life, as a likeness of the wind which smites a people whose souls have wronged themselves, and it is not lawful for them to destroy it, and it is not wrong for them.
O you who believe! take not your friends for friends instead of your allies; they will not be able to harm you in the love of your own souls. They love their hatred from their mouths, and conceal what is their breasts. Thus We have made clear to you the communications, so that you may understand.
They are the ones who love you, but they love you not, and you believe in Allah and the Book. They say, "We believe," when they meet you, they say, "We believe in your rage." Say, "It is not for your death. God knows what is in the breasts."
If good befalls you, it grieves them; but if some misfortune befalls you, they rejoice in it and they will rejoice in it. But if you are patient, their deeds will not hurt you. God encompasses all that they do.
(Remember) when you (O Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) from your family (O Muhammad SAW), when you entered your homes in battle for the believers, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
When two parties parties against you, they wished to help Allah, and Allah is their Protector, and the believers trust in their trust.
God had helped you at Badr when you were weak, so fear Allah, so that you may be grateful.
When you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord will help you with three thousand angels sent down?"
If you are patient, then if you are patient, then you will come to your Lord, and your Lord will help you with five thousand angels.
And Allah made it not only as a trial for you, and that your hearts may rest in it; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
That He might cut off the unbelievers or expose them to infamy, so that they may turn away.
(Muhammad), there is no concern in that for you (O Muhammad SAW), whether He turns to them or punish them. And they are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers).
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He pleases; and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O you who believe! Do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that you may be successful.
And fear the Fire which has been prepared for the unbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, that ye may receive mercy.
“And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who fear Allah.
Those who spend in prosperity and adversity, and who restrain their anger, and pardon men, and Allah loves those who do good.
And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins, and who forgives sins save Allah?
For the reward of their Lord is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever; and excellent is the reward of the workers.
Many nations have passed away before you, so travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who disbelieved.
This is a declaration for mankind, and a guidance and a reminder for the cautious.
“And do not be weak, nor grieve, but you will be superior, if you are believers.”
If a wound has touched you, it is a wound like the unbelievers, and We have made some of them turn away from men, and that Allah may know those who believe, and that Allah may know those who believe, and Allah does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may test those who believe and deny the disbelievers.
Did you think that you will enter Paradise in Allah's cause, and those who are steadfast in the cause of Allah (i.e. Paradise), and those who are steadfast?
And you did not wish for death before death before you have seen it, and you have seen it.
Muhammad is not a messenger before him; so if he dies, he will turn away from him; then if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? But if he turns away from his heels, Allah will not hurt him.
And it is not for death except for death except by Allah's leave; and whoever desireth the reward of this world, We shall give him his reward; and whoever desireth the reward of the Hereafter, We shall give him thereof, and We shall surely reward the grateful.
And how many of the prophets have fought with Allah, and they were not weak in the way of Allah, nor did they grieve in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken; and Allah loves the patient.
They said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses in our affair, and make us firm, and make us firm over the unbelievers."
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter, and Allah loves the good-doers.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will turn back losers.
Nay, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers.
Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah for that which He had sent down no authority.
Allah has promised for you the promise, so when they break against you, then you did not kill him, and when you dispute, then you dispute in the matter of the matter, and when you have been given what you have been given, then you have been given to Allah, and He has given you the life of the Hereafter, so He has made you successors from among you. He has given you His mercy, and Allah has mercy over the believers.
When you did not turn away, then he did not hear anyone, and the Messenger has come to you from your rear, so He made you sorrow, so that you might not grieve from what befell you, and that which befell you not, and Allah is aware of what you do.
Then He made a veil upon you after a group, a group of a group, a group of a group, and a group of a group, and another group, and another group, and a group, they said, "What is it that we have done for us?" They said, "What is it that we have been doing?" They said, "What is it that we have been doing?" They said, "What is it that we have been doing?" They said, "This is what God has given us.
Those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met, Satan made some of them slip to some of them, so that Allah has pardoned them; and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, when they go out of the land when they travel in the land or fight in the land, and they say, "If they had been with us, they would not have died, nor would they have been killed." That is Allah's cause for their hearts and death; and Allah sees what you do.
And if you are killed in the way of Allah or die, forgiveness from Allah and mercy is better than all that they amass.
And if you die or die, then will you be gathered to God?
So it was from the mercy of Allah that thou wast lenient with them; and if thou hadst been rough and hard hard, they would certainly have dispersed from around you, and pardon them: and ask pardon for them and consult with them in the affair; then when you have decided, then put your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah helps you, there is no power over you; and if He forsakes you, then if He forsakes you, then who can help you after Him? And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
It is not for a prophet who does not commit adultery, and he who does evil will be on the Day of Resurrection, and then he will be paid on the Day of Resurrection, so that every soul will be paid back to it, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who hath incurred wrath from Allah, whose abode is Hell, and whose abode is an evil resort?
They are in the ranks of Allah, and Allah sees what they do.
Allah has conferred a great favour on the believers when He raised among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them, and instructing them the Book and Wisdom, although they were in manifest error.
And when a affliction befell you, then you have a double number twice, and you said, "What is it that you have brought?" Say, "This is from your own hands. God has power over everything."
And what befell you on the day when the two armies met the battle of Allah, and that He might test the believers.
And the hypocrites said to them, "Come in the way of God, or fight in the way of God." They said, "If we had been known, we would certainly have been fighting with you." They said, "If we had been fighting, they would have been given to you.
Those who say to their brothers, "If they had been given us, they would not have killed us." Say, "If you are truthful, then die from death."
“And reckon not those who are killed in Allah’s way as dead; nay, they are alive, provided sustenance with their Lord.
They rejoice in what Allah has given them of His bounty, and they have not joined them with those who are behind them, and they have no fear of them, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice with grace from Allah and His bounty, and that Allah does not reward the believers.
Those who responded to Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW) after the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and those who do good deeds, for them is a great reward.
Those to whom the people said, "Indeed, the people gathered against you, so fear them," but it increased them in faith and they said: "Allah is sufficient for us and He is the best Disposer of affairs."
So they returned from Allah's grace and bounty, not touched them with evil; and they followed the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is the Owner of great bounty.
It is only Satan who suggests his allies to you, so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers.
And let not those grieve thee who rush headlong to disbelief, for they will not hurt Allah. Allah will not give them any portion of them in the Hereafter; and they shall have a grievous chastisement.
Those who believe in the cause of Allah will not hurt Allah, for them is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that their respite is better for them: We grant them respite for their sins, so that they may increase their sins, and they shall have a disgraceful chastisement.
It is not for Allah that you should be given the believers, until you are in the right of the good, and Allah does not know that which is hidden in the unseen, and Allah chooses of His apostles whom He pleases, and He chooses of His apostles whom He pleases; so believe in Allah and His messengers.
And do not think that what Allah has given them of His bounty, think that it is better for them. Nay, it is worse for them that they shall be niggardly for their necks on the Day of Resurrection. On the Day of Judgment, they shall be on the necks of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
Allah said: "Verily, Allah has heard the words of those who say: 'Allah is poor, and we are rich.' We said: We have told what they said, and the slaying of the prophets, and We will say: 'Taste the punishment of the Fire.'
That is because of what your hands have sent forward, and that Allah is not unjust to His servants.
They say: "Allah has not ordained that we should not believe in any messenger unless he comes to us." Say: "Messengers have come to you before me with clear proofs. Say, 'Messengers came to you before you, and you were truthful; then you were truthful.'
But if they reject thee, they were messengers before you, who came with clear proofs, clear proofs, and scriptures, and the Book of Enlightenment.
Every soul shall taste death, and you shall be paid on the Day of Judgment, and then the Fire will be made to be a reward of the Fire, and the garden will be admitted to the Garden, and the life of this world is nothing but a delusion.
You shall surely be tested by your wealth and your lives, and you shall hear from those who were given the Book before you and from those who were given the Book before you; and if you are patient and fear Allah, then surely that is the matter of the matter.
And when Allah took a covenant from the People of the Scripture (i.e. the Qur'an), that He may make clear to you the people (i.e. the Qur'an), and it is not clear to mankind, but they threw it away, so they threw it away, and they have sold it (i.e. Paradise), so that they (the disbelievers) have made a miserable price for it.
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have earned will be praised for what they have not earned, and that they should be praised for what they have not earned. They will have a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over all things.
“In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the earth and the day, there are signs for men who are mindful.”
Those who remember Allah standing standing, sitting and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], "Our Lord, You have not created this aimlessly.
Our Lord, whomsoever You admit to the Fire, You have disgraced him, and there is no helpers for the wrongdoers.
O our Lord! we have heard the call of a call calling to faith: "Believe in your Lord, we have believed in your Lord." Our Lord said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our evil deeds, and we will be among those who do good."
Our Lord! Grant us what Thou hast promised us by Your Messengers, and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection, for Thou art not the tryst.
So their Lord said to them, "I do not like any of you or your wife, or not of your own hands, nor do you eat of them, and some of you are equal to your homes, and for your homes, and in the cause of your homes, and in the cause of Allah, they will be forgiven from their sins, and they will be forgiven from it. This is a reward from Allah. That is a reward from Allah."
Do not let the earth deceive you in the land.
This is a brief enjoyment, and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.
But for those who fear their Lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein for ever, and that which is with Allah is better for the good.
And among the People of the Book are those who believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to you, and that which has been sent down to them before Allah, and that they may not sell the communications of Allah.

O you who believe! persevere in patience and remain steadfast, and remain steadfast and fear Allah, that you may be successful.
O mankind, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single soul, and created from him his mate, and from them He created many men and women and women and women, and fear Allah; surely Allah watches over you.

And do not let those who do not give your wealth to Allah for your means for your sustenance, and provide for them sustenance from them, and speak to them kindly and speak to them kindly.

If you are given them, then give them their wealth, and do not eat of them; and do not eat of them, and do not eat of them, and do not eat of them; and if any of you do good, then let them take advantage of them; and Allah is sufficient for all things.
There is a share for what parents from parents and relatives, and from behind their parents, and from their parents, and from their parents, or of their relatives, or a little or a little.
And when the relatives and the orphans and the needy are present to the needy, give them out of them, and speak to them words of kindness.
And let them fear that they should leave behind their offspring, if they should fear them, then let them fear Allah, and let them speak words.
Those who eat the wealth of the orphans (polytheists, polytheists, polytheists, etc.), except that which they used to eat (of the Fire), and they will be in the blazing Fire.
Allah has prescribed for you your sons: for the two sons of their sons is better than one of the two daughters, and the best of their wives. And if they are two sons, they are two of them; and if they are married, they are two of the two sons; and if they do not know it, then it is for the two of them, and if it is for you, then it is for them that you may not know what is right for them; and if it is only for you, then it is for the command of Allah, and that which is right for them, and that which is right for them is nearer to Allah, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
And for your wives, that which your wives have taken to your wives, and if any child have a son, they would have given them a son, and if they have taken a child, they would have given you wives, and if you have not taken a child, they would have given you a son, and if you have not taken a child, they would have given you a son, and if you have not taken a child, they will have no power over them; and if you have a child, they will have no power over them.
These are the limits of Allah, and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and that is the supreme achievement.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will admit him to the Fire, to abide therein, and he will have a disgraceful punishment.
And if any of your women are guilty of lewdness, then bring four witnesses against them against them; if they testify, confine them from houses until death death or Allah will guide them for a way.
And (as for) those of you who are guilty of indecency, then give them a double (punishment), if they repent and amend, turn away from them; surely Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.
Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and in ignorance; then they will turn back to repentance; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.

O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women until they are weak.

And those who accuse not believing women among the believing women, who have given the hearts of men, and that of which you are of those of you who are believers, and Allah knows best those who are believers, and who are not of the believers.

Tell them of the truth of the two sons of Adam, when they sought one another for one another, and the two of them accepted from one another, and said, "I will kill you." They said, "I will kill you." They said, "Indeed, Allah accepts only those who fear Him."
“If you stretch your hand against me to kill me, I will not stretch my hand to kill you, for I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”
Verily, I intend to be your sin to you as your sin and your sin, and you will be the dwellers of the Fire, and the wrong-doers will be the recompense of the wrong-doers.
So he killed his brother to kill his brother, so he killed him, and he became one of the losers.
Then Allah sent down a raven to the earth in the land. He said, "Woe to me, what is my brother's brother?" He said, "Woe to me! I will surely be like the like of my brother's brother, and my brother's brother." And he became one of the guilty.
That is because We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless it is for murder or mischief in the earth, it is as if it is as if he had killed all mankind, and if he saved him, it is as if he had saved all mankind.
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.
Except for those who repent before you, then know that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.
O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek the means of nearness to Him and strive in His cause that you may be successful.
As for those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much as much as much as much as the punishment of the Day of Judgment, it will not be accepted from them from the punishment of the Day of Judgment, and they will have a painful punishment.
They will wish to go out of the Fire, but they will not be able to escape it, and they will have a lasting punishment.
As for the hands of the male and female, whether they cut off the hands of the hands of Allah, and the hands of those who have earned their hands. Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
But whoever repents after his crime and does good deeds, Allah will turn to him in repentance; surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Do you not know that Allah is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He pleases; and Allah has power over all things.
O Prophet, let not those grieve you grieve with those who disbelieve in their disbelief. They say, "We believe," and their hearts have not believed, and their hearts have not believed. They are Jews of the Jews. Those who are Jews say to them, "This is what they have been commanded to do." They say, "This is what God wants to do.
They are those who deny the lie of falsehood. If they come to you, then judge between them between them, or turn away from them. But if they turn away from them, they will not hurt you. If they turn away from them, then judge between them with justice; surely Allah loves those who do good.
And how do they judge with you that they should judge with Allah? That is the Torah which is with them, then after they turn away; then they are not believers.
We have sent down the Torah wherein was guidance and light and light and light, and the prophets and the rabbis, and the Jews, and the Jews, and those who were given the Book to the Book of Allah, and they were witnesses of the Book of Allah. So fear them not, and fear not My revelations, for they are unbelievers.
And We have ordained for them in this life for a life, for a eye, and for a nose, and for a nose, and for a nose, and for a ear, and for a tooth, and for a tooth, and for a tooth, and for a tooth, it is for him that he may not judge what Allah has sent down. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down do not judge.
And We sent in their footsteps Jesus, son of Mary, confirming that which was revealed to him in the Torah, and We gave him the Gospel wherein was guidance and light and confirmation of the Torah confirming that which was before it, and a guidance and a admonition for those who fear Allah.
And let the People of the Book judge that which Allah has sent down, and they do not judge according to what Allah has sent down.
And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) the Book (the Qur'an) in truth, confirming the Book that is before the Book before it, and the witness of Allah (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Injeel (Gospel)). So judge between them between what Allah has sent down to you, and do not follow your desires (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and do not follow your desires (i.e. Allah's command). He will make you taste of all that He has given you; then you will be brought back to Allah.
And judge between them between what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their desires, but beware of them lest they tempt you from some of that which Allah has sent down to you. But if they turn away, then know that Allah will punish them. And many of mankind are transgressors.
Do they wish to seek the command of the command of Allah? And Allah is better than a man who is in a state of affairs.
O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And you see those in whose hearts is a disease, they say, "We fear lest some misfortune befall us." Then Allah will bring a promise from Himself, or then bring a revelation from Allah, and they will be forgiven by what they used to hide.
And those who believe will say, "Are these the people who swore by Allah by their strongest oaths?" They will have their deeds, so they will have been losers.
O you who have believed, whoever from among you turns away from his religion, then Allah will bring a people whom He will love, and they will love Him who love Him, and those who disbelieve in the cause of Allah. They strive in the cause of Allah, and do not fear the censure of the critic. Allah is the All-Embracing, the All-Knower.
Your guardian is only Allah and His Messenger, and those who believe, and pay the prayer and pay the zakat, and they bow down.
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and those who believe, then surely the party of Allah will be the triumphant.
O you who believe! make not the unbelievers for those who have gone before you (O Muhammad SAW) for those who were given the Book and those who were before you, for those who were given the Book (i.e. those who were given the Book of the Book), and for those who have disbelieved (in the Torah), and fear Allah, if you are believers.
And when they call you to prayer, they take it for mockery and sport, that is because they are not a people who understand.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), do you disapprove of us for no other than that we believe in Allah and what was sent down to us and what was sent down before us and that most of you are disobedient?"
Say: "Shall I inform you of something worse than Allah, that they are the ones whom Allah has cursed with His wrath and His wrath, and those whom He has cursed, and some of whom He has made some of those whom He has made, and those whom He has made, and are far astray from the Path?"
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe," but they are going to disbelieve with it, and they are with it, and Allah knows best what they hide.
And you see many of them in sin and transgression, and in the unlawful and in the unlawful, and evil is that which they do.
Do they not forbid the rabbis and the rabbis and the devouring of the unlawful of the unlawful and the devouring of the unlawful? Evil is that which they do.
The Jews said, "God's grace is on hand, and their hands are on their hands." They were cursed by their hands. Nay, it is only in the hands of Allah, except for the other. And if it is revealed to them, they will not be able to make it clear to them. And if it is from your Lord, He will cause them to die in the land, and in the cause of Allah. And Allah loves not those who do mischief. Allah loves not the transgressors.
And if the People of the Book had believed and feared Allah, We would certainly have removed from them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of Bliss.
And if they had believed in the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to them from their Lord, they would certainly have eaten from above them and from beneath their feet, and some of them are a group. And most of them do evil deeds.
O Messenger, deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and if you do not do it, you will not have delivered His message; and Allah will protect you from the people; surely Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.
Say, "O People of the Book, you have no power until you stand upon the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and that which has been sent down to you from your Lord.
Those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there shall be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
We made a covenant with the Children of Israel and We sent messengers to them. Whenever there came to them a messenger, they did not desire to themselves their souls, and some of them slew others.
And they thought that there would not be a trial, then they became deaf, and they became deaf; then Allah turned away from them, and many of them became blind, and they became blind.
Those who disbelieve say, "Indeed, the Messiah, son of Mary, is God's Messiah, who disbelieved in Allah, and the Messiah, and the Lord of Israel." He said, "O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Indeed, Allah has forbidden for those who associate partners with Allah, and the Fire is a helper for the wrongdoers."
Those who say: "Allah is the third of the Jews." There is no god but He. There is no god save Him. But if they do not desist, then a painful punishment will befall them of the unbelievers.
Will they not turn away from Allah and seek His forgiveness? Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger before him. The apostles have passed away before him, and his mother was truthful. They were eating of food. See how We make clear to them Our signs. See how they are turned away.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Allah that which has no power to harm you or harm you, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing?"
Say, "O People of the Book, do not exceed the limits in your religion except the truth, and follow not the desires of the people who had gone astray before you and have misled many of them, and have strayed from the path."
Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and of Jesus, son of Mary, and the tongue of Mary, because they disobeyed and persisted.
They did not forbid one another to forbid what they did. Evil is what they did.
You see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Evil is that which their souls have sent before them, and that Allah is displeased with them, and they will abide in it forever.
And had they believed in Allah and the Messenger and what was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends; but many of them are transgressors.
You will surely find most of the people who believe in the cause of the Jews and the idolaters, and you will surely see those who say, “We are Christians.” And if they say, “We are Christians.” That is because of some of them and women are not proud.
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you will see their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the truth. They say, "Our Lord, we believe, so write us down among the witnesses."
And why should we not believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, in order that we may believe in our Lord, and that we may be among the righteous.
But Allah has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, wherein rivers flow for ever, and that is the reward of the righteous.
But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they shall be the dwellers of the Fire.
O you who believe! do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress limits; surely Allah loves not the transgressors.
And eat of the lawful things which Allah has given you of good and lawful, and fear Allah, in Whom ye are believers.
Allah has sworn for you by your oaths that you may not forget your oaths, and that you may take away from it, so that some of them may eat of it; and if some of them eat of their homes, they will not be able to eat of it; and if they do not take a vow, they will not be able to give you the power of Allah, and that you may be grateful.
O you who believe! intoxicants and gambling, and divining arrows and divining arrows are the handiwork of Satan, so avoid them so that you may be successful.
Satan desires to deceive enmity and hatred between you and gambling, and from the remembrance of Allah and from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you not then abstain?
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) and obey the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), and if you turn away, then know that our duty is only to convey the message of Our Messenger (Muhammad).
There is no blame for those who believe and do good deeds that they should have no fear of what they have eaten, and do good deeds, and do good deeds and do good deeds, and then fear Allah and do good, and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! Allah has given you some power from your hands, or that which is with you, so that He may know that Allah knows that which he fears in secret; then whoever transgresses after that, he will have a painful punishment.
O you who believe! Do not be in the land, but you shall not be able to eat of yourselves; and if you die, then it is for you to be a man who is a one of you who is a enemy, or a one who is a enemy, or a one who is a enemy to the enemy, or that which is a place, or a woman who is a enemy, or a woman who is a enemy, then he will be a trial for him, and Allah is Mighty, Mighty.
Lawful to the sea has been made lawful for you, and for your sustenance, and for a provision for you, and for you is a provision for the pilgrimage, and you are forbidden to the land. Fear Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Ka'bah (the Ka'bah) for the Ka'bah (the Ka'bah) for the Ka'bah (the Ka'bah) and the month (the Ka'bah), and the month (the Ka'bah) for mankind, and the month (the Ka'bah), and the month (the Ka'bah), that you may know that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth, and that Allah knows all things.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution and that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message, and Allah knows what you hide and what you hide.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The hypocrites are not equal as the weight of the good and the good, but the abundance of the Most High (Allah) will give you abundance. So fear Allah that you may be successful."
O you who believe! do not ask about questions about what is clear to you, if they are clear to you, then if you ask about it, they will be sent to you; and Allah will forgive you; and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.
A people before you, and they rejected it, then they disbelieved.
Allah has not made for the Bahirah, nor <unk>, nor <unk>, nor <unk>, but those who invent lies against Allah, and most of them do not know.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," they say, "Enough for us is what we found our fathers following." Even though their fathers knew not, nor were they guided.
O you who believe! take your own souls, when you are guided, no harm can hurt you. To Allah is your return, then He will inform you of what you did. He will inform you of what you did.
Believers, if you are dead of death, two of you are better than one of you, and if you are standing on the earth, then you are (dead) in the land, and if you are dead, then you will be dead of death; and if you are witnesses, they will be dead.
But if it be known that they are guilty of the wrong-doers, then the two of them are among those who claim other than their own selves, and they swear by Allah, and they swear by Allah: "Our testimony is truer than our testimony, and we have not transgressed, and we have been of the wrongdoers."
That they may be nearer to the truth, lest they should fear their oaths, or fear their oaths after their oaths; and fear Allah, and listen to Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust people.
On the Day when Allah will gather them together, He will say, "What did you have done?" They will say, "We have no knowledge. You are the Knower of the unseen."
And when Jesus, son of Mary, said, "My father, I will give you the favor of my mother and my mother and my mother, and I will help you with a people in the midst of the people and in the earth; and when I have given you the Book, I will give you the interpretation of people in the land and in the earth; and when I have given you the Book, it will be a place of light, and it will be said, "This is nothing but clear magic."
And when I said to the disciples, "Believe in Me and My Messenger," they said, "We believe, and bear witness that we are Muslims."
And (remember) when the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, will your Lord send down to us a table from heaven from heaven?
They said, "We wish that we may eat from it, and our hearts have hearts, and we know that you are the truth, and that we may be witnesses."
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "O Allah, our Lord, send down for us a table from heaven from heaven, that it may be for us to be the first of us and the first of us and the last of us, and a sign from You. You are the best of providers."
Allah said: "I will send down it (this Qur'an) down to you, and if you disobey any of you, I will punish him with a severe torment, if I have no more than any one of you."
When Allah said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you not say to mankind, 'Worship me, my mother and my mother?' They will say, "Glory be to you, I am not of the truth." He will say, "You will surely know what I say to you. I know what is in my heart. You know what is in my heart, and I do not know what is in your heart. You are the Knower of the unseen."
I said not to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord, and I was a witness over them, and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them.
If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise.
Allah will say: This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truthfulness; theirs shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him. That is the supreme achievement.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in the earth, and He has power over all things.
All praise is due to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the light light and light; then those who disbelieve ascribe equals to their Lord.
It is He who created you from clay, then decreed a term, then decreed a term (of death), then (then) that you doubt.
And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth; He knows what is hidden and what is hidden, and He knows what you earn.
No sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it.
They rejected the truth when it came to them, so they will come to what they used to mock.
Have they not seen how many generations have We destroyed before them? We have established the earth in the earth, which We had established for you, and We made the sky flow from beneath them, and made rivers flow beneath them, and made them flow beneath them, and made them a new creation.
And if We had sent down to you a Book on paper, so they would have touched it with their hands, those who disbelieve would say, "This is nothing but clear magic."
And they say, "Why has not an angel sent down?" And if We sent down an angel, it would have been given to them, and they will not be given respite.
And if We had made him an angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would have made them confusion in what they have done.
Messengers were mocked before you, but they used to mock what they used to mock.
Say: Travel in the land and see how was the end of those who rejected (the truth).
Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To Allah belongs Allah's mercy and He has decreed for Himself the Day of Judgment." He will surely gather those who have lost their souls.
And to Him belongs whatsoever is in the night and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Say: "Shall I take for myself a protector other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He feeds sustenance for sustenance and His provision: Say: 'I am commanded to be commanded to be the first of those who submit to Him.'
Say: "If I do not disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous Day."
On that day, on the Day of Judgment, Allah has mercy on him, and that is the manifest achievement.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, none can remove it but He; and if He touch you with good, then He has power over all things.
He is the Omnipotent, the All-Wise, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.
Say: "What is the greatest of these things? Say: 'Allah has given me a witness, and I have a witness in Allah and has been revealed to me.' Say, "I have been sent down to you." Say, "There is no god but Allah." Say, "I do not bear witness to you.
Those who have given the Book know that they recognize their sons, but those who have lost their souls will not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or denies His signs? But the unjust will not prosper.
On the Day when We gather them all together, We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, "Where are your partners whom you used to assert?"
Then they will be no more than they say, "By Allah, we were not associated with Him."
See how they lie against themselves, and what they used to invent has gone away from them.
Among them are some who listen to you, and We have made veils for their hearts, lest We have ears to understand their hearts, and deafness in their ears; but if they see all signs, they will not believe in it; but when they come to thee, they say: This is nothing but tales of the ancients.
And they prohibit (others) from it, and they turn away from them, and they do not destroy themselves, but they do not know.
And if you could see when they are made to stand before the Fire, they will say, "If only we would be sent back, and we would not deny the signs of our Lord, and we are believers."
Nay, what they used to hide before them have come to them, and if they were back back to them, they would surely go back, and they are liars.
And they say, "There is nothing but our life in this world, and we shall not be resurrected."
And if you could see when they are before their Lord, He will say, "Is this not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say, "This is the punishment for you, so taste what you used to disbelieve."
Those who deny the Meeting of Allah, they are losers, and when the Hour comes on them, they say, "Alas for us, because we have neglected what we have neglected, and they will not be their backs."
And the life of this world is nothing but amusement and amusement; and the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, then do ye not then understand?
We know that they will not grieve you. Nay, they do not lie to you, but they deny the signs of Allah. Those who disbelieve deny the signs of Allah.
Messengers were denied before you, but they were patient with their rejection, and they were patient, and they were patient until Our help came to them; and there is no power to alter the words of Allah.
And if their turn away, you would surely seek if you turn away from the earth, and if you seek a tunnel into the earth or a ladder on heaven, then bring them a sign, and if Allah had willed, He would have guided them all, so do not be of the ignorant.
Those who listen to Him will be accepted; and Allah will resurrect them on the Day of Resurrection, and to Him shall they return.
They say, "Why has not a sign sent down upon him from his Lord?" Say: "Allah has sent down a sign, but most of them do not know."
And there is no animal on earth, nor a bird flying with its two wings, but they are not like you, but We have not neglected anything in the Book, and they shall be gathered to their Lord.
And those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), are deaf and dumb, and in the darkness of darkness (i.e. the Qur'an), Allah will mislead them, and whomsoever He wills, He will guide him on the Straight Path.
Say: "Have you considered if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or the Hour comes to you, then call upon any other than Allah?
Nay, but He will call upon Him, and if He wills, He will remove upon you that which you call upon Him, and you will forget what you associate with Him.
And indeed We sent messengers before you, so We seized them with distress and adversity, so that they might humble themselves.
So when Our punishment came to them from Us, they did not worship them, but their hearts were hardened, and Satan made evil for them that which they were doing.
So when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened for them the gates of all that they had been given, and We seized them with what they had done, so they were in despair.
So the wrong-doers were cut off, and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
Say: "Have you considered if Allah has hearing your hearing and your sight, and set up your hearts for a seal, who is there other than Allah?
Say: "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly or openly, will be destroyed except for the unjust people?"
And We send not messengers as bearers of glad tidings and warners, and those who believe, and do righteous deeds, shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
As for those who reject Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will be punished for what they used to do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you, I am an angel, and I follow nothing except that which is revealed to me. Say: 'The blind and the blind are not equal.' Will ye not then reflect?
And warn those who fear their Lord, that they may have no protector besides Him, nor shall they have any protector besides Allah, and that they may be godfearing.
And turn not away from those who call upon their Lord in the morning and evening, seeking His countenance, and they shall not be responsible for their account on account of their reckoning, nor shall they grieve for you; and if you turn away, then you will be of the unjust.
And thus have We made some of them some of others that they may say: “Are these the ones whom Allah has bestowed upon us?” Allah does not know those who are grateful.
And when those who believe in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) come to you, say: "Peace be upon you, your Lord has prescribed for Himself His mercy, so if you do evil in ignorance, then repent and amend (in evil), then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), so that they may be guided (from evil).
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah, and say: "I do not follow your desires, and I will not follow you, and I will not be of the guided ones."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I am clear a clear proof from my Lord, and you deny that which you have not been impatient, and that which is not for me is nothing except for Allah; He is the best of deciders, and He is the Best of deciders."
Say: "If it is for me that you hasten to me, it would have been between me and you would have been judged. God knows best the wrongdoers."
And in Him is the keys of the unseen, but He knows not that which is in the sea and that which is in the sea; and He knows that which is in the land and in the sea; and there is no leaf but there is no leaf but He knows it, nor is it in a clear book.
And He it is Who takes your souls by night, then He knows what you have done on day, then He raises you up again, so that the appointed term is appointed for you; then to Him is your return, then He will inform you of what you did.
And He is the power over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, then when death comes to death from death, Our messengers will not die, and they will not be disappointed.
Then they will be brought back to Allah, the Truth, the Truth, and He is the All-sufficient, the All-reckoning.
Say: "Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him secretly and secretly?" Say: "If only we should be of the grateful."
Say: "Allah delivers you from it and from every distress, then you associate others with Him."
Say: "He has power over you from above your feet, or from above you, or to make you sects in sects and make you taste of mutual violence. See how We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that they may understand.
And your people deny it, and it is the truth. Say: I am not responsible for you.
Every appointed term will come to you, and you will know.
And when you see those who plunge away from Our signs, turn away from them until they plunge away. But if Satan causes Satan to forget you, then do not go back to the people of the unjust.
And those who fear Allah will not be accountable for them, but they will be reminded of that which they fear.
And (remember) those who take their religion as a sport, and create them, and present them in the life of this world, and the remembrance of the world will be for him, and he will not be able to have any protector besides Allah, nor will they have any protector besides Him.
Say: "Shall we call upon Allah that which does not profit us nor profit us, and if we turn back after Allah has guided us?
And (remember) the prayer (prayer), and fear Him, and be careful to be (to Him) to Whom you shall be gathered.
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth; and on the Day of Judgment He will say, "Be," and it is. His Word is the truth, and the day is blown to be blown. He is the All-knowing, the All-wise.
And (remember) when Ibrahim said to his father Azar: "Do you take idols for idols? I see you and your people in manifest error."
And thus did We show Ibrahim the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, that he might be of those who believe.
So when the night came to pass, he saw a star, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "I do not love those who love him."
When he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it came to pass, he said, "If my Lord does not guide me, I will surely be of the erring people."
Then when he saw the sun rising, he said: This is my Lord; this is greater than this: when it came to pass, he said: O my people! I am not of those who associate partners with Allah.
I have turned my face to Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and I am not of those who associate partners with Allah.
And his people argued with him, saying, "Do you dispute with me about Allah that He has guided me with guidance? I fear not that which you associate with Him. I fear that my Lord will not desire my knowledge. Will you not then believe?"
How should I fear those whom you associate with Allah? Do you not fear that Allah has not sent down to you any authority for which He has sent down to you no authority? If you know, then the two parties will be better than the two parties.
Those who believe and do not have faith in their souls, and they are the ones who have no power, and they are the guided.
And this is our reasoning which We gave to Abraham for his people; We raised on whom We will, and lo! thy Lord is All-Knowing, All-Knowing.
And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, each one of them guided, and We guided him, and We guided Nuh, and Sulaiman, and Sulaiman, and Ayub, and Ayub, and Moses and Aaron; thus do We reward those who do good.
And Zachariah and John, and Jesus, and Elias, each one of the righteous.
Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishmael (Ishmael), Jonah (Jonah), Jonah (Jonah), Jonah (Jonah), Jonah (Jonah), and Al-Lout (Lot), all of them.
And We made from their fathers and their brethren and their brethren, and We guided them, and We guided them to a straight path.
This is the guidance of Allah, He guides whomever He wills of His servants.
Those are the ones who gave the Book to the Book and the Prophethood and the Prophethood; but if they do not believe in it, We would have made a covenant for them.
These are the ones whom Allah has guided, and follow their guidance. Say: "I ask no reward for you. This is not a reward for you."
And they did not have any power for Allah, but they said: "Allah has not sent down to you a sign from Allah." Say: "Who has sent down the Book (Torah) to Moses, and guides you to the Straight Path?" Say, "What is the Book?" And when you do not know what you did not have nor did not know what you did not have nor did not have your fathers.
And this is a Book which We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW), confirming that which is before it, and that you may warn the Mother of Cities (Makkah) and the Meeting around it, and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are watchful of their prayers.
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah, or says, "I am sent down to me that has been sent down to me?" He said, "I have sent down the Book." Say, "I am sent down to the Book." Say, "I am sent down to the Book of death, and you will not be able to say, but when you see, then the angels will be with you.
And you have come to Us, as We created you, as We created you, and you shall not turn back to your backs from what We have bestowed on you, and We do not see with you with your intercessors that which you asserted, and that which you asserted, you are the followers of the pit.
It is Allah Who splits the grain and the date, and He brings forth the living from the living from the dead, and the living from the living from the dead, and it is Allah that is the <unk>.
It is He Who has made the night in the midst of the night, and He has made the night and the moon, and the sun, the moon, the moon, the moon, the All-Knowing, the All-Knowing.
And it is He Who has made the stars subservient to you, that He may lead you through the darkness of the sea and the sea through the sea; surely We have explained for people clear signs.
It is He who has created you from a single soul, then there is a place for you, and a resting place, and We have explained the signs for a people who understand.
It is He Who sends down water from the sky, then We produce it with fruits, then We bring forth fruits from it, then We bring forth vegetation from it, and from the trees and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and the trees, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and beasts, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and beasts, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and beasts, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates.
And they ascribe to Allah partners (partners) with Him, that He created them, and they have no knowledge of their knowledge, and sons, and daughters, and they attribute to Him what they do.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth; how has He taken a son? He has created all things, and He has created all things. He knows all things.
That is Allah, your Lord, there is no god but He, the Creator of all things, so worship Him; therefore worship Him.
No vision can grasp Him; but He sees the vision, and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.
Verily, there has come to you clear proofs from your Lord; so if he sees it, it is for his own soul, and whoever is blind, it is for his own loss; and I am not a guardian over you.
And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that they may say, and that they may say: "You have studied," and that We may make it clear for people who know.
Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord; there is no god but He, and turn away from the idolaters.
And if Allah had pleased, they would not have associated up with Him; and We have not made you a keeper over them, and you are not of them a guardian.
Do not revile those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they insult Allah, and We have made some of their deeds to be worshipped, and We have made every thing for their own deeds; then their Lord will inform them of what they did.
They swear by Allah by their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they would believe in it. Say: "Signs is with Allah, and what is the matter of Allah that you may not believe?"
And We turn their hearts and their eyes, as they did not believe in it, but We leave them in the first of their rebellion.
And if We sent down to them the angels, and the dead had spoken to them, and We had gathered all things before them, they would not believe unless Allah willed, but most of them are ignorant.
And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy for every prophet from among mankind and jinn, revealing to each other in order to deceive each other, but your Lord would not have done it, so that your Lord would not have done it.
And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with it, and that they may have done what they used to do.
Say, "Shall I seek other than Allah as a judge? It is He Who has sent down to you the Book (the Qur'an), and the Book (the Qur'an) which is given to the Book (i.e. the Book), that they may know that it is your Lord from your Lord (i.e. the Qur'an).
And the word of your Lord is accomplished in truth and in justice: None can change His Words; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from the path of Allah.
Surely your Lord knows best who has strayed from His way, and He knows best those who are guided.
So if you believe in Allah, then you are in the remembrance of Allah that you should believe.
What is it that you do not eat of Allah's name which He has forbidden for you? He has made clear to you what has been forbidden to you, and that you have been given to the knowledge of Allah, and most certainly many of you follow their own desires. Indeed your Lord knows best those who do wrong.
And forgive the sin of sin and sin, and they shall be requited for what they have earned.
And do not eat of what Allah's name has not been mentioned for you, and that is that which is wrong, and the devils inspire their hearts to dispute with you; they dispute with you, if you obey them.
Is he that We give life to life, and made a light a light which he hath made manifest to mankind? Is it not that it is that which is in the darkness of the man (i.e. the Qur'an) which is in the darkness of Allah (i.e. the Qur'an), and that which is not made fair for the disbelievers?
And thus have We made in every city an enemy of their sinful ones, that they may plot therein, and they do not scheme against themselves, and they do not know.
And when a sign comes to them, they say, "We will not believe in it until we have been given to Allah." And Allah knows best that which is sent to His Messenger (Muhammad SAW), and that Allah will afflict them with a severe torment from Allah, and a painful torment will befall them.
And whomsoever Allah wills, He opens their breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills to err, He makes his breast narrow and constricted, as if he were climbing up in the sky, and Allah does not expose those who believe.
And this is a Straight Path from your Lord, indeed We have explained the signs for a people who believe.
For them is the abode of their Lord, and He is their Protector, and He has made for them what they used to do.
And on the Day when He will gather them all together, say, "O you people of jinn, you have made many of mankind in the midst of the nations, and the people will say to their Lord, 'Our Lord, we have preferred each other for each other.' He will say, "Our Lord is the Fire of the worlds." He will say, "This is your home.
Thus do We make some of those who are unjust of what they used to earn.
O assembly of jinn and mankind, did not Messengers come to you from among you relating to you My signs and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours? They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves and the life of the life of the world." They will bear witness, and they bear witness themselves against themselves.
That is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly, while their people were unaware.
And they are degrees of degrees for what they have done, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
Your Lord is full of mercy and mercy; if He wills, He will destroy you, and He will destroy you after your successors.
Indeed, what is promised you will come, and you will not escape.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Work according to your deeds; I am acting in (your) deeds, and you will know that you will know the Hereafter. Verily, the unjust will not prosper."
And they assign for Allah a share for the crops and cattle which He has created, they say, "This is for Allah," and they say: "This is for our gods, and for our partners."
And thus have We made the covenant of the covenant of the covenant of the covenant of the covenant of the covenant of the covenant of the polytheists, so that they may cause them to destroy them, and to confound them in their religion; and if Allah had willed, they would not have done it.
And they say, "We are forbidden to eat crops and cattle, except for whom we please." They are forbidden, and they are forbidden, and they are forbidden, and they do not mention the name of Allah's name.
And they say: "What is in the bellies of the cattle is in the bellies of our males, and for our wives, and for our wives, and if they die, it is all that they have done; and if they are dead, they will be all-knowing and all-knowing."
Those who have lost their children without knowledge without knowledge, and who have forbidden what Allah has given sustenance for them, they have forbidden a lie against Allah, and they have been certainly astray, and they are not guided.
And it is He Who brings forth gardens, gardens, and gardens, and gardens, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and the fruit of its fruit; and the term of its fruit is due to its fruits; and the end of the earth is not due to God.
And some of the cattle have been given for them, and on earth; and Allah has provided sustenance for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; he is indeed a manifest enemy.
[13:14] He has two pairs, two pairs, and two pairs, and two of the two females; Say: "Has He forbidden two males or two females?
And of the two camels, and the two females? Say: Has He forbidden the two males or the two females? Or hath He forbidden the two females or the two females? Whether Allah hath commanded you to say, He hath forbidden for you a thing when ye were commanded, and he who forges a lie against Allah, he is more unjust than he who forges a lie. Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not eat of what has been sent down to me in that which has been revealed to me, except that which is forbidden, or that which is forbidden, or eat of flesh, or eat of flesh, or eat of that which they call upon name besides Allah, or that which is not due to any other than the name of Allah, except that he is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
And We have forbidden for the Jews all who were forbidden, and We forbade the sheep of sheep, and the sheep, and the sheep, and their sheep, or their sheep, or the roots of their hands; and it was like a good thing, so that We might punish them for their sins; and if they are truthful, We shall surely say: We are truthful.
But if they belie you, say: "Your Lord is the Owner of Mercy, and His wrath will not be averted from the guilty people."
The idolaters will say, "Had Allah willed, we would not have worshipped Him, nor would we have our fathers, nor did we have forbidden anything." But before those before them who were before them, they said, "This is a clear sign." Say, "This is clear proof." Say, "This is a clear proof."
Say: "Allah is the conclusive argument. If He willed, He would have guided you all."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Bring witness that which you bear witness from Me, and do not bear witness with them, and do not bear witness to anyone who has rejected Our signs and do not believe in the Hereafter.

And this is my Straight Path, so follow it, so follow it, and do not follow other paths, for they will separate you from His path.
Then We gave Moses the Book (the Qur'an) to complete His favour (i.e. the Qur'an) upon His servants (the Qur'an), and explaining all things, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might believe in their Lord.
And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, that you may receive mercy.
Lest you (O Muhammad SAW) say: "It is not sent down to us (O Muhammad SAW) in the Book (the Qur'an) before two sects (i.e. Jews) before us, and we are unaware of what they used to do."
Or they said, "If we had been sent down to a Book, we would certainly have been guided better than them." If there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, there has come to you clear guidance from your Lord, and a guidance from your Lord; then he who turns away from the signs of Allah and turns away from them will have a painful punishment.
Do they not consider that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord will come to them from your Lord, or of the signs of your Lord? On the Day of Judgment, there will be signs from your Lord, and he will not believe in his faith. Say: "Wait!" Say: "Wait!" Say: "Wait, then wait!"
Those who divide their religion and break up into sects, you have no portion in them in the least; their affair is with Allah, then He will inform them of what they did.
Whoever brings a good deed shall be recompensed for the like thereof; and whoever does evil, it shall be nothing but the recompense thereof, and they shall not be wronged.
Say: "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, a true religion, the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the idolaters."
Say: “My prayer and my sacrifice and my death and my death are for Allah, the Lord of the worlds.
There is no god but He, and I have been commanded to have been commanded, and I am the first of those who believe.
Say: Shall I seek other than Allah? He is the Lord of all things, and He is the Lord of all things; and every soul shall be only for his own soul, and no bearer of burdens shall bear another burden against another: then shall ye return to your Lord, then He will inform you of what ye used to differ.
It is He who made you inheritors of the earth, and raised some of you above others above others, so that He may try you in that which He has given you; surely your Lord is quick in retribution; surely He is Forgiving, Merciful.
Alif Lam Mim, Meem.
This Book is sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW), so that you may warn them in it (the Qur'an) in your heart, and that it may not be for the believers, nor for the believers.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and do not follow other than Him, for you are little.
And how many a township have We destroyed, so Our punishment came to them at night or they were sleeping while they were sleeping.
But when Our punishment came to them, they said, "We were wrong-doers."
Then We will question those who were sent to the Messengers, and We will surely question the messengers.
So We will inform them of them with knowledge, and we are not absent.
And on the Day that the truth will be true, and those whose scale will be heavy, they will be successful.
And as for those whose scale are light, they are those who have lost their souls, and they deny Our signs.
And We have made you successors in the earth and made for you livelihood for your livelihood; little are you grateful.
And indeed, We created you (Adam), then gave you shape (Adam), then We said to the angels, "Prostrate before Adam"; and they prostrated, except Iblis (Satan), except Iblis (Satan).
He said, “What prevented you, when I have commanded you, I said, ‘I am better than I am better than me.’ You created me from fire and created him from clay.
(Allah) said: "Get down from it, it is not for you to be arrogant. So go forth, and you will be of the losers."
He said, “Give me respite until the Day of Resurrection.”
He said, "You are given a respite of the respite."
He said: "I have caused you to go astray from me, and I will surely see you in a straight path."
Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them, and from their right and from their left, and you will not find most of them grateful.”
He said, "Get down from the kingdom of heaven, and go away from them, and I will fill you with Hell, all together."
"O Adam! dwell thou in the Garden and your wife, and eat of it as ye please; but approach not this tree, lest ye be unjust."
Then Satan whispered suggestions to them in order that He might manifest to them what was hidden from them, and said, "Your Lord has forbidden you from this tree except that you should become angels or ever."
And he swore to them, "I am indeed a sincere adviser."
So He caused them to fall into deception, and when they tasted the tree of the tree, their shame became clear to them, and they said, "Did I not forbid you of the tree of the garden?" Their Lord said to them, "Did I not forbid you of this tree? I do not say to you, Satan is an open enemy to you."
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will surely be lost."
(Allah) said, "Go down, all of you, enemies of one another, and for you there is a abode in the earth and a provision for the appointed time."
He said, “Therein you shall live, and therein shall you die, and from it you shall be brought forth.”
O Children of Adam, We have sent down to you a garment from which you cover your shame, and the adornment of the garment, and the garment, and the garment of piety. That is the best of Allah, that they may remember.
O Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you, as he expelled your parents from the Garden, stripping them from their parents, stripping them of their shame, so that he may show them their shame, and he will not see you from his position; surely We have made the devils a guardian for those who believe not.
And when they commit an indecency, they say, "We found our fathers doing that we found our fathers doing God." Say, "God has commanded us to do justice. Say, 'God does not forbid what you do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has commanded justice (i.e. Islamic Monotheism), and (so) He (Allah) has commanded you every place (i.e. worship) every place (i.e. worship) every place (i.e. Islam) and invoke Him (i.e. Islam), and invoke Him (i.e. Islam)."
He has guided a group, and a group has been deserved in error, because they have taken devils apart from Allah, and they think that they are guided.
O Children of Adam, wear your adornment at every time of prayer, and eat and drink, but do not be excessive, for God loves not those who do not love.
Say, "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants and the good things?" Say: "They are in the life of this world, in this world and the Day of Resurrection. Thus do We explain the signs for people who have knowledge."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "My Lord has only forbidden indecencies indecencies, which is apparent and concealed, and sin, and sin, and oppression, and oppression, and that you associate with Allah that which He has not sent down to you, and that you say about Allah what you do not know."
And for every nation is a term appointed, and when their term is appointed, they shall not be able to change it, nor will they be able to change it.
O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you My verses, then whoever will fear and mend, then there shall be no fear on them nor shall they grieve.
But those who deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and are arrogant from them, they are the companions of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or His revelations? And when they come to Our signs, they will be given a portion of the Book, until when Our messengers come to them, they will say: Where are you called to you? They will say, "Where are you called to you?" They will say, "They are disbelievers."
He will say: "Enter the gates of Hell (Hell), the people of jinns, and the people who passed away before you, when a group of the people will come to it, and when it comes, it will be said to them: 'Our Lord, we have led us astray.' They will say, "Our Lord! You have led us astray." He will say, "Our Lord has led us astray. He will not have a double torment."
And the first of them will say to the last of them: "You have no power over us, so taste for what you used to earn."
As for those who reject Our signs and scorn them, not the gates of heaven shall be opened to them, nor shall they enter the garden, nor shall they enter the camel until the camel camel, and thus do We requite the guilty.
They shall have a bed of fire, and a covering over them; and thus do We requite the unjust.
As for those who believe and do good works, We shall not burden any soul except for its capacity. These are the companions of Paradise, and they will abide therein forever.
And We shall remove their hearts from their hearts; rivers flow beneath them, and they will say, "Praise be to Allah, Who has guided us from this path. Had Allah not guided us for guidance, we would not have been guided." Our Lord said to them, "This is the Paradise of the Garden, which you have been given."
And the dwellers of the Fire will call out to the dwellers of the Fire: "We have indeed found what our Lord promised us. Have you found what your Lord promised to be true?" They will say: "What is the truth of your Lord?" They will say: "Allah's curse is against the unjust."
Those who hinder from the way of Allah and seek to seek it crooked, and they are not in the Hereafter.
And there is a barrier between them, and on the left, men will know their marks, and they will say to the dwellers of Paradise, "Peace be upon you." They will not have entered it, they will not have entered it.
