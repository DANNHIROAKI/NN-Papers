The Compassionate, the Merciful,
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
The Merciful, the Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgment.
You are you to worship Him, and we are a sincere ones.
Guide us to the Straight Path.
The path of those who have been given mercy upon you, and they are not astray.
Alif. Lam. Mim.
This is the Book. There is no doubt for those who fear Allah and the guidance.
Those who believe in the Unseen and perform the prayer, and spend from the cause of Allah.
And believe in what has been sent down to you and what has been sent down before you, and those who believe in the Hereafter.
These are the ones who have guided from their Lord, and they are the successful.
Indeed, those who deny the truth will not be warned for you, or you will not believe.
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing and their eyes. Theirs are a great punishment.
And among them are those who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day, and we believe not in the Day of Judgment."
They deceive Allah and the believers, but they deceive them, but they perceive not.
In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has cursed them, and a painful punishment awaits them.
And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption in the earth," they say, "We are only peacemakers."
Indeed, they are the ones who do not understand, and they do not perceive.
And when it is said to them: Believe in that which we believe, and they say, "Shall we believe in it?" Nay, it is they who believe in it, and they know not.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe." But when they are alone with their devils, they say: "We are only mocking."
Allah will give them respite, and will make them wander in their insolence.
These are those who have bartered guidance for guidance, and they have no fear, nor shall they be guided.
Their likeness is like those who kindled a fire, and when it had lit a fire, Allah took away their light and left their light.
Deaf, dumb, and blind.
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, thunder, thunder, thunder, and lightning, and lightning, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears, and fear the punishment of Allah.
The lightning almost snatches away from them. When they see it, they walk in it. But when they see it, they walk in it. But when Allah willed, He could have made them their hearing. God has power over all things.
O you who have believed, worship your Lord, and have created you, and that you may be Godwary.
It is He who has made the earth a bed for you, and sent down water from the sky, and sent down water from the sky, so that you may eat from it. And do not set up rivals to Allah.
And if you are in doubt about that which We have sent down to him, and that which is revealed to you, then bring a surah between you, and call upon Allah, if you are truthful.
And if you do not do, and you will not be able to fear it, and fear the Fire, and prepared the unbelievers for the unbelievers.
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, and We shall make them enter gardens underneath which rivers flow, and they shall say: 'This is what we have been given.” They will say, "We have given a fruit before it, and they have provided it with fruits." They are the companions of Paradise, and they will abide therein.
Allah has no example over them, except a gnat. The unbelievers are those who believe in the truth, and they say, "This is what is in the hearts of Allah." They are more than God than a few. God leads astray to them, and guides them astray. He leads astray from the way.
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the land. They are the losers.
How do you not believe in Allah, and He gave you life? Then He gave you life, then He will give you life, then He will bring you back to life, and to Him you will be returned.
It is He who has created the earth in the earth, so that He might bring it forth from the earth, and He has made them seven paths, and He has knowledge of all things.
And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "I am placing to you in the earth." They said, "Will you make the earth?" They said, "We will surely shed it and shed the praise of your Lord." He said, "I know that you do not know."
And He taught Adam the names (of Adam), and He gave them the angels, and said, "Tell me, if you are truthful."
They said, "Glory be to You. You have no knowledge from what You have taught us. You are the All-knowing, the All-wise."
He said: "O Adam! Inform them of their names." And when they saw their names, they said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth? And I know that which you do not know."
And when We said to the angels, “Bow down before Adam”; they bowed down, except Iblis; he refused, and he was one of the faithless.
And We said: "O Adam, dwell in your garden and eat, and eat you in the Garden, and do not approach the tree, and do not approach the tree."
So Satan caused them to slip from them, and We said to them, "Go out from the Fire." They said, "We will be enemies to each other, and a place of the earth."
So Adam learnt his Lord's command, and He accepted his repentance; indeed He is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
We said, "Go down from it, and will follow it." But whoever follows My guidance will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
But those who disbelieve and belie Our revelations, they are the inhabitants of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour that I have bestowed upon you, and fulfill Me with you, and I fear that I shall be of you.
And believe in that which has been revealed to you and that which hath been sent down to you, and barter not the revelations for those who deny My revelations, and barter Me for a humbling price.
And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth.
And perform the prayer, and pay the poor-rate, and bow down with those who bow down.
Do you enjoin righteousness and forget what you do not know? Do you not understand?
And pray in prayer and prayer, and for the help of the believers.
They are they who believe in their Lord, and to Him they are returned.
O Children of Israel! Remember My blessing wherewith I favoured you, and I preferred you to the nations.
And guard yourselves on a day when no soul shall avail, nor shall intercession be accepted, nor shall intercession be accepted, nor shall they be helped.
And recall what time We delivered you from Fir'aun (Pharaoh), and afflicted you with a dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live. Verily, your Lord was a great trial for you.
And when We parted the sea, then We drowned you and drowned the sea, and We drowned you all together.
And when We appointed forty nights for forty nights, then he took up the calf, and you were unjust.
Then We pardoned you, so that you might be grateful.
And when We gave Moses the Book and the Criterion, so that you might be guided.
And recall when Moses said to his people: "O my people! I have wronged a calf, and slay you, and slay you, and slay your Maker, and kill you. Maybe He wills, He will give you mercy. Indeed, He is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful."
And when you said, “O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see Allah's revelations, and you see the thunderbolt struck with the thunderbolt.”
Then We raised you back after death, and We gave you that you may be grateful.
And We shaded you from the clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails, “Eat of the good things We have given you, and do not be unjust to the unjust.”
And recall when We said, "Enter this town and eat, and eat wherever you enter the gate." They said, "We will enter your sins, and forgive you your sins. We will forgive the righteous ones."
But the unjust among those who were unjust to the wrong-doers had said to them, "This is because of the wrong-doing, so We sent down upon them the punishment of the heaven.
And when Moses said to his water, We said, “Strike your staff.” And when you gushed down, he gushed down in the ground, and said, "Eat of the water, and eat for God's provision, and do not eat in the land."
And when it said to them: "Come to the rock, and do not be like the rock." They said, "We will be given the rock." And We made the House of the two-place, and We made the place of the two-doers, and the other-place, and the other-place, and the other-place, and the other-doers, and they will be called to the enemies of Allah, and disobeyed the prophets and disobeyed the prophets. Thus did they kill the prophets and disobeyed the prophets because of what they did?
Indeed, those who believe, and the Christians and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do righteousness, and do not believe in God and the Last Day, and shall not fear nor shall they grieve.
And recall when We took a covenant above you and raised the Mount above you, saying: Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember that which is in it, and that haply ye may ward admonition.
Then you turned away after you, and had turned away from your Lord, and would not have been among the losers.
And you know that the Sabbath of those who passed before you, and We said to them, “Be apes, despised and despised.”
So We gave them a sign, and a admonition for those who passed away, and a admonition for the Godwary.
And when Moses said to his people, "He commands you to sacrifice a cow." They said, "Do you want to abandon us?" He said, "I fear God, the ignorant."
They said, "Pray to our Lord that He may make it a cow." He said, "This is a cow." He said, "It is a cow that is young." So she said, "I do not want to be a middle cow."
They said: "Beseech upon our Lord that He may bring us a cow." He said: "This is a cow that is yellow." He said, "This is a yellow cow and bright colour."
They said, "Pray to our Lord that He may bring us a cow." They said, "We are a cow, and cows are alike." And Allah will make the truth.
He said, "He says, "It is a cow, a heifer." They said, "It is a cow." They said, "You are a cow." They answered, "You are a cow." They answered, "You are being overtaken."
And when you killed a man, then he became a enemy to you, and disputed about it; and Allah is aware of what you do.
So We said, "Strike him in a piece of the earth." Thus Allah restores the dead to life and shows you the dead, so that you may understand.
Then, after that, We have destroyed the hearts of the people, and We have built them in the sky, and there are some of them stones of water, and there are some of them that splinter and stones, and there is no fear from them; and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
Do you believe that they should believe in the believers, and they have not heard the Word of Allah? They have understood it, so that they may understand.
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe in it." And when they are alone, they say, "Why has Allah revealed to you what you did not know?" They will say, "Why is your Lord's command? Will you not understand?"
Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they disclose?
And among them are those who have no knowledge in the Book, and do not know the Book, but they only speculate.
So woe to those who write the Book before them, and they say, "This is from Allah." So woe to them for what they have earned, and woe to what they earn. Woe to them for what they used to earn.
And they say, “There is no punishment for us for a few days.” They will say, “Why has Allah sent down a promise for us? Do you not know that Allah has promised you? Do you not know?”
But those who do evil, and evil evil deeds, shall be the fellows of the Fire, and they shall abide therein forever.
But those who believe and do good deeds, these are the dwellers of Paradise, and they shall abide therein forever.
And recall when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, "Worship none but Allah, and do good, and to parents and relatives, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and that you turn away.
And when We took a covenant from you from your own selves, and We did not shed your blood, nor your blood. Then, when you were a witness, they will testify in your homes.
(O Prophet), you are a enemy from your own people, and from the people of travellers, and made you go forth from your homes, and you are not in the Sacred Mosque, and they are not divided to you, and you will not be able to be given to you in the life of this world; and if you are given to a painful punishment, they will surely have lost you in the life of this world; and the punishment of the Hereafter is the punishment of the Hereafter; and Allah sees what you do.
These are the ones who bought the life of this world, and they shall not be helped, nor shall they be helped.
And indeed We gave Moses the Book, and We gave him the son of Maryam, and We gave him the son, son, son of Maryam, son of Maryam, and supported him with a light. And whenever he came to you with a light, they would not be arrogant.
And they say, "We are the wrappings ones." They have incurred the wrath of Allah, and they have no faith.
And when a Book had been revealed to those who have been sent down before the Book, confirming what was sent down before them, they would not believe in it until they had been sent before. And when the Messengers came to them, they disbelieved in it; and the curse of Allah is the curse.
Do they think that they have no power to believe in Allah, and He has sent down to His grace His grace, and He sends down His grace upon whomever He pleases, and that He may afflict them from His wrath, and for them is a humiliating punishment.
And when it is said to them, "Believe in what God has sent down," they say, "We believe in what has been sent down to us, and we believe in what is revealed to us." Say, "Have you been sent to believe in Allah after His Messenger? Why did you kill the prophets?"
And Moses came to you with clear proofs, but he turned to the calf, and you were arrogant.
And when We took a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you, and said: "Hold fast to what We have given you." They said, "We hear and obey the calf." They said, "We believe in what you have done." And it was that you were believers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If the Home of the Hereafter and the Hereafter are specially for you, if you are truthful, then if you are truthful."
And they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have sent before, and Allah knows best the unjust.
And they will find for them a portion of the life of the world, and for them is a thousand years, and there is a thousand years for them, and he is more than a thousand years, and he will not harm him; and Allah sees what they do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (i.e. the Quran (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Gospel (i.e. the Taurat (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), and that which was revealed to Allah (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.), and that it may be a guidance and glad tidings to those who believe.
Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His angels and the Michael, and Michael, and Michael is the enemy of Allah.
And indeed, We have sent down to you a clear revelations, and none of them deny the truth.
Is it not that a covenant from them, a group of them? Yet most of them do not believe.
And when a Messenger came to them from Allah, confirming that which they had been given, and those who have been given the Book before the Book of Allah, and they know not.
And they entered the people who slew the calf, and said, "We are the people of the heavens and the earth." They said, "We have been killed in this." And We gave the people of the Book, and they were a lot of them, and they were in the means of the other. So those who were given the worldly life, so that they might be overtaken. So those who do not believe in this world and in the Hereafter, so that they may be given to ruin. Indeed, it is the evil-doers, but they did not know it.
And if they had believed and believed, then the reward of Allah is better for them, if they only knew.
O you who believe! Do not say to those who believe, and say, "Unzurna." They say, "It is a painful punishment."
The unbelievers among the People of the Book and the unbelievers have not been sent down to you from your Lord. But if you have a good good, He will have given him a mercy from His mercy; and Allah singles whomever He wills, and He is the possessor of mighty grace.
And if We abrogate a verse or We abrogate a verse or it is better than it, or whether it is better than it? Do you not know that Allah is Able to do all things?
Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? And besides Allah, you have no protector nor helper.
Have you asked to ask the Noble Messenger before you? And he who disbelieved in the way of Moses, and who are further astray.
Many of the People of the Book wish that they may believe in you, but they disbelieved in their hearts, and if they have come to the truth after it has come to them, and forgive them, and forgive them; and Allah has power over all things.
And give the poor-rate and give the poor-rate, and do not give your charity for it. Allah is Seer of what you do.
And they say, "There is a Jew and a Christian." They will say, "There is a Jew and a Christian." They say, "If you are truthful."
Indeed, whoever submits himself from Allah and does good, and he shall have a reward from his Lord, and no fear shall be upon them nor shall they grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians are not equal to the Christians and the Christians." They will say, "The Jews, the Christians are the Jews." They will say, "This is the Day of Resurrection." They will say, "God will judge between them."
And who is more unjust than he who does not believe in Allah and His Name, and strives in the name of Allah? They rejoice not in the land, nor shall they grieve. For them is degradation in this world, and in this world is a mighty punishment.
And to Allah belong the east and the west. So turn away from Him. Indeed, Allah is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
And they say, "Allah has taken a son." Glory be to Him! He is the All-sufficient and the heavens and the earth. To Him belongs all things.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a thing, He will say, "Be," and it is.
And those who do not say, "Why does not Allah speak to us?" They say, "Why does we not send a sign to us?" They said, "We are a people who lived before them." Thus We have explained the signs for a people who believe.
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad SAW) as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner and a warner, and the dwellers of the Fire will not be asked.
And the Jews will not be entered with you, nor will they be entered with their religion. Say, "This is the guidance of Allah. If you follow the guidance, then follow that which is revealed to you, and follow your desires. You will not find a protector nor helper.
Those to whom We have given the Book, and they read it as it ought to believe. Those who believe in it are the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and I preferred you to the worlds.
And guard yourselves on a Day when no soul shall avail another another, nor shall intercession be accepted for it, nor shall intercession be accepted, nor shall they be helped.
And when Abraham brought out of his family, and he fulfilled them, he said, “I have given you a leader of yours.” He said, “My Lord is the unjust of my family.”
And when We made the House a place for the people, and We placed a place of the House, and he said, “House of Abraham, and make the House of Abraham, and make the House of Abraham, and the House of the House and the House, and those who bow down, and those who bow down.”
And when Abraham said: "O my Lord! Build a palace secure, and provide its fruit for a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do not believe in the Day of Resurrection, and I will add a increase for the disbelievers, and then I shall add him to the torment of the Fire.
And when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House, they said, "Our Lord, accept us from us. Indeed, You are the All-hearing, the All-knowing."
And our Lord, make us submissive to Thee, and make us submissive to our descendants, and make us submissive to Thee, our Lord, and forgive us; indeed You are the All-forgiving, the All-merciful.'
Our Lord, raise them to a people who have come to them, and teach them the Book, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.'
And who does not believe in the religion of Abraham, and he chose him? And We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous.
When his Lord said to him, "Surrender!" He said, "I am the Lord of the Universe."
And We gave his sons and his brother, and he said, “O my people, Allah has chosen you for you, and do not have faith in Him, and do not be Muslims.”
Why, when he came to his death, he said, "Will you worship?" They said, "We will worship what you worship, and Allah's sons, and Isaac, and Isaac, and Isaac, and Isaac, and Allah, and to Him we have submitted."
This is a nation that has passed away, and for them is what they have earned; and you will be repaid for what you did.
And they say: "Why do you not follow the Christians?" Say, "The Jews is the religion of Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists."
Say, "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Ishaq and Yaqoub and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and the prophets, and we have no knowledge in it."
If they believe in the believers, they will believe in it. But if they turn away, they will be guided, and if they turn away, they will have no friends from Allah; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
That is Allah's coloring, and that which is better than Allah, and to Him we are submissive.
Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “What do you think that Allah should bring us witness? Our Lord, our Lord, our our Lord, and forgive us our sins and your deeds, and we are your Guardian.”
Or do you say that Abraham and Isaac and Ishaq and Jacob and Jacob and Jacob and Jacob? Say: "Are you better than Allah?" Say, "Who is better than he who conceals a testimony?" And who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.
This is a nation that has passed away, and for them is what they earned; and you shall have the reward of what you earned, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
The foolish among them will say, "What has turned away from them?" Say, "To Allah belong the east and the west. He guides whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills."
And We have made you a clear example, and We have made you a clear community, and a man among you, and a warner. And whoever is a enemy from his Lord. And whoever turns away from his Lord, so that it may be a enemy for him; and whoever disbelieves in Allah's way, so that Allah may make it a way for you, and Allah is compassionate and merciful.
And We will see you in the heaven, and We will make you turn away, and turn away from your faces. And if you turn away, then turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. That is the truth from your Lord, and they are not aware.
And if you ask the Book, they will not follow it, nor follow the direction of the Book. If you follow the direction of the Book, they will not follow it. If you follow the desires of the truth, you would surely be among the wrongdoers.
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it, and they recognize their own sons; and most of them know the truth.
This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be of the doubters.
And there is a direction from which he turns away, and whoever is good, then he will be better for them; and Allah will bring you together. Allah is Able to do all things.
And if you turn away from your face, turn away from the Sacred Mosque. Indeed, your Lord is the truth, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.
And when you turn forth, turn away from the Sacred Mosque, and turn away from the Sacred Mosque, and do not turn away from them, and turn away from them. Do not fear them, and fear Me, so that you may fear Me, so that you may be guided.
(Muhammad), I have sent you as a Messenger from among you, to recite Our revelations to you, and to teach you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and that you may know what you did.
So remember Me, I will remember you, and remember Me and do not be ungrateful.
O you who believe! Seek steadfast in prayer and prayer; and Allah is the steadfast.
And do not see those who are slain in the way of Allah. They are dead, but you are dead.
And We will surely test you, and test you in wealth and lives, and loss, and loss, and loss, and to the steadfast.
Those who affliction befalls it, say, "We are Allah's servants, and we will be returned to Him."
They are those who are before their Lord and the mercy of their Lord, and they are the rightly guided.
The Safa and the Marwa are the Safa, and the pilgrimage, and the pilgrimage for the pilgrimage. But if any one should touch the House, or if it is no sin, and if Allah is Appreciative, Knowing.
Those who conceal the Book after it had been revealed to them, and We have given the Book that which We have revealed, and Allah will curse them with the curse of the curse.
Except those who repent and amend, and make amends. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.
Those who disbelieve and die, and die, and the curse of Allah, the angels, and the angels.
They will dwell in the Fire, and they will not be able to avert it, nor shall they be reprieved.
And your God is Allah, there is no god but He, the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
Indeed, the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, and We sent forth the rain, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and in the heavens and the earth. Indeed in that are signs for a people who understand.
And among them are those who take up rivals to Allah, while they love Him, and those who believe in Allah and the believers, and they strive in Allah's cause, and they will not be able to die in the life of the world. And Allah's punishment is severe.
And when they are followed, then those who follow the truth, and will be brought back to their faces, and they will be brought back.
And those who will say, "If only we had a chance of chance, we would disown them." They will say, "We have lost themselves, and Allah will inform them from what they used to do."
O mankind, eat of what is in the earth and that which is lawful for you; and follow the footsteps of Satan, and follow the footsteps of Satan.
He commands you to commit indecency and indecency, and what you do not know.
And when it is said to them: "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say, "We have found our fathers following our fathers, and we did not follow their fathers."
The likeness of those who disbelieve in the truth is nothing but a likeness of one who shouts to the call of Allah. Deaf, dumb and blind, and they do not understand.
O you who believe! eat of the good things We have provided you, and give thanks to Allah, if you are grateful.
There is not lawful for you in the name of Allah, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine, and the flesh of swine. But whoever does not eat the limits, nor does he kill it, and whoever does not eat it, then Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Verily, those who conceal that which Allah has sent down, and purchase a small price, and barter not a small price for them, and they shall not speak to the Day of Resurrection, nor shall Allah speak to them, nor shall they speak.
These are those who have bartered guidance for guidance and seek forgiveness for the price of the price of the unbelievers, and they will be brought back to the Fire.
That is because Allah has sent down the Book, and that which is in the Book, and far in dissension.
And to you is he who has come to you in the Throne, and of the believers, and to the needy, and the needy and the needy, and the needy and the needy, and the needy and the wayfarer, and the prayer, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and the women and the women, and the women and the women, and the women and the women and those who are steadfast, and they are the believers.
O ye who believe! there is no sin in you, and he is a sin of the two-camel, and she is a woman who carries her husband and his wife, and that she may be a woman's wife and his wife, and that she may be a woman's wife, and that she may eat her, and that he may be a sign from his Lord, and that it may be a sign from his Lord, so that it may be a painful punishment.
And there is a lesson for you in the life of this world, and that you may be grateful.
But if you die a time, then if you die, he will bequeath it to his parents and relatives, and he is a duty to the righteous.
But if he turns away, then he is a sin for it; and Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
But if any one fears the sin of a testator, or a sin or a sin, he will have no sin between them; and Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, and We have made it mandatory before you, that haply ye may be mindful.
Fasting of a appointed day, and if a number of a journey is sick, then if it is a redemption for him, and if it is a redemption for him, he is a redemption for him, and if he is a redemption for him, he is better for him; and if it is better, it is better for him; and if you do not know it.
There is a guidance in the Qur'an, and that which is in the Qur'an, and that which is in it, and whosoever is in the Book, and he who is a pilgrimage, and he who is given a portion of it; and if ye are admonished, it is for his own sake; and if you are grateful, then remember it; and if you are grateful, then remember Allah, and He may give you a way, and that you may be thankful.
And if My servants ask you, ask me that I am near. So call to Me, and I will call to Me, and I will call to you, and I will not believe in the believers.
And for the number of the night is for you, that you may not be able to do that which you have forbidden, and that you may not be able to do you, and you will not be able to keep your homes in the way of Allah. And if you are sick, you will not be able to keep you in the way of Allah. And if you are pregnant, you will give you the burden of the poor, and do not obey the women. But if they are pregnant, you will know that Allah has shown them, and that you may know the limits. That is what Allah has revealed to you, so that they may be mindful.
And do not consume your wealth with your wealth, and do not consume the property of the other, and do not consume the property of the other, and that you may eat.
They ask you about the pilgrimage. Say: 'The pilgrimage is for the pilgrimage, and the pilgrimage, and the pilgrimage, and the pilgrimage, and do not approach the pilgrimage, and do not approach the Sacred Mosque. So be wary of Allah, and fear Allah, so that you may prosper.
And fight in the way of Allah with those who fight against you, and do not exceed the limits. Indeed, Allah does not like the aggressors.
And slay them wherever you find them, and expel them from the Sacred Mosque, and kill them wherever they drove you to the Sacred Mosque, and fight in the Sacred Mosque. So if you fight them, they fight in the Sacred Mosque. So fight against them, and slay them. Indeed, they are a painful punishment.
And if they do not desist, then surely Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Then We turned away from the land, and We turned away from the sea, so that he might see it. He said, "This is how I will send it back to the birds." Then, it was that which he turned away, and He said to them, "What is the matter of you?" He said, "He is the Witness over all things."
And recall when Abraham said, "My Lord! Show me the dead." He said, "Do I not bring you back to life?" He said, "O my Lord!" said, "Do not be able to kill me."

But those who disbelieved, and gave them a taste of this world and the Hereafter, and they shall have no helpers.
And as for those who believe and did good deeds, He will pay them full of full; and Allah does not like the unjust.
This is that We recite to you the verses of the Wise, the Wise.

Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book (Jews and Christians), and we have no share to worship (Allah), and we have no share to worship Allah (Alone), and we have no share to worship none but Allah." And if they turn away from Allah, they say: "Bear witness that we are believers."
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham and the Taurat and the Injeel? Will you not then understand?
Do you think that you have no knowledge about what you have no knowledge? Do you dispute about what you have no knowledge? God knows what you do.
Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian, and he was a Hanif, and he was not of the idolaters.
Abraham (Abraham) is a group of Abraham, and he who was the believers, and the Messenger and the believers, and Allah is the Best of those who believe.
A group of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray, but they lead you astray, but they perceive not.
O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah, and do not bear witness?
O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth and conceal the truth?
And a party of the People of the Book said: "Believe in that which was sent down to the believers (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), and the believers (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and those who believe at it, so that they may turn back.
And do not follow the religion of those who follow the religion of religion, and say: "This is the right religion." Say: "Do not believe in that which has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to you?" Say: "Whatever is Allah's hand. He gives it to whom He wills, and He gives to whom He wills, and Allah is Ample-Knowing, All-Knowing."
He singles to whomever He wills, and He is the possessor of mighty grace.
And of the People of the Book is he who would ask you to be good, and if you entrust a treasure, he will not be able to ask them. And if they ask you, he will not say to them, and they say, "This is not for us." They say, "God has not given us a lie." They say, "God is not a witness."
Yes, and whoever fulfills his covenant, and Allah loves the righteous.
Those who sell Allah's covenant, and purchase a small price in the life of this world, they shall not be able to give them a portion of the life of the world, nor shall they look on Allah, nor shall they grieve. Theirs shall be a painful punishment.
And among them there is some who distort the Book with their tongues, and it is a heaviness in it. They say, "It is from Allah." They say, "It is from God." They have no knowledge from it, but they say, "God is not a thing."
It is not for any mortal that Allah has given him the Book and wisdom, and he would say, "Be my Lord," he said, "Be my Lord." Say, "Do not say to those who have been given the Book, and I have studied in it."
And We did not give you a covenant for the angels, nor would we have taken a covenant to you, so that you would believe in your religion.
And recall what time We gave you the Book and the prophets, confirming that which hath been revealed to you, and that ye may believe in Allah and the apostle, and He said: If ye are a apostle, then ye shall not be able to say, and Allah's apostle said: 'Be your pledge'; and when they said, 'Be,' and we said: 'I am quit of you.'
But if they turn away, then it is they who are the transgressors.
Do they seek a religion other than Allah? And whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, willingly and unwillingly, will be returned to Him.
Say, "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the Tribes and the prophets and the prophets, and we do not believe in the prophets, and we have surrendered to Him, and to Him we have surrendered."
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, he will not be accepted from him, and he will be among the losers.
How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after they believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that after the truth had come to them? Allah does not guide the unjust.
The requital of those who have no knowledge of Allah, the angels, and the angels,
They will abide therein forever, and they shall not be able to be reprieved nor shall they be reprieved.
Except for those who repent after it, and know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And those who disbelieve after having believed, and then disbelieved after their disbelief, and they shall not be accepted to be lost.
As for those who disbelieve, and die, and die, and will not be accepted by the earth, nor shall they be accepted by a ransom. They will have a painful punishment.
It is not for you to spend in the way of Allah, and give you out of charity; and Allah knows best whatever you do.
The food of the Children of Israel that forbade food for the Children of Israel in the Torah, and after the Taurat. Say, "Bring down the Torah, if you are truthful."
But whoever fabricates a lie against Allah, then surely it is the unjust.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Allah has spoken the truth, and follow the religion of Abraham (Abraham), Hanifa to Al-Mushrikun (the polytheists, etc.)."
Indeed, the first House of the House was a source of Bekka, and a guidance for the worlds.
There is clear signs for Abraham in the place of Abraham, and he enters the House of pilgrimage, and he is a pilgrimage for the House. But whoever is forced for the sake of Allah, it is no need for him. But whoever disbelieves, then Allah is Independent of all things.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Why disbelieve in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, and do not believe in it?"
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book! Why do you hinder the way of Allah who believes in the way of Allah, while they know it? And Allah is not unaware of what you do."
O you who believe! if you obey a party of those who have been given the Book, they will turn you back after you, if you are believers.
And how can you disbelieve in the verses of Allah when you are recited to His verses and His Noble Messenger? And Allah has chosen for you the right path.
O you who believe! fear Allah and fear Him, and do not die.
And hold fast to the covenant of Allah, and hold fast to Him, and remember what He has bestowed upon you, and He has restrained for you His grace, and He has restrained for you His grace. And if you were killed, He will cast you into the Fire, and He will make you taste your religion. Thus Allah makes His signs clear to you, so that you may take heed.
And there will be a group of you who invite you to the right, and forbid what is right and forbid what is wrong, and they are the successful.
And be not like those who were divided in their religion and differed after it had come to them. For them is a mighty punishment.
On the Day when some faces will be bright, and some faces will be black, and they will be told, "Did you believe in it? Taste the punishment for the unbelievers."
And as for those whose faces are whitened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and they will abide therein forever.
These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you in truth; and Allah does not make any injustice to Allah.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and to Allah all things are returned.
This is a community that has passed forth from among mankind, and that which is wrong, and forbidding what is wrong, and forbid what is wrong, and forbid what is wrong, and do not believe in the Book; and if they had believed, it would have been better, and most of them are believers.
They will not be able to harm you, but if they are attacked, they will fight against you; and if they turn back, then they will not be helped.
Abasement will be pitched upon them, and they will be pitched with a troop of them, and they will be pitched in the wrath of Allah. They have incurred the wrath of Allah and slew the prophets, and they slew the prophets unjustly, and because they were killed.
They are not alike in the Book, but they recite the verses of Allah in the night, and they recite the night in the hours of the night.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and forbid the righteous. These are the righteous.
And those who do not believe, they will not be able to do it; and Allah is the Best Knower of the pious.
As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them aught against Allah. They are the inhabitants of the Fire, and they will abide therein.
The likeness of those who spend in the life of this world is the likeness of a man who smites its harvest, and destroys it, and destroys it. Allah has wronged them, but they wronged themselves.
O you who believe! Do not befriend those who have no friends, but they will not harm you, and they will not be proud. They have already been proud in the way of their mouths. Hatred is greater than what they conceal, and We have explained a sign in detail, so that you may understand.
They are you who love you, and they love you, and you love the Book, and they say, "We believe in you." And when they meet you, they bite their fingertips in you. Say, "Die in your rage." Say, "Die in rage." And Allah knows what is in the breasts.
If a good deed befalls you, it grieves it; and if it befalls you, they rejoice in it; and if you are patient, they rejoice in it; and if you are patient, then know that Allah is aware of what they do.
And when the house of the two armies entered, let the believers fight in the battle, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
When two parties among you were about variance, and Allah has forgiven them; and Allah loves the believers.
And Allah has destroyed you in Badr, while you were weak, and that you may be grateful.
And when you said to the believers, "Is there not enough for you that your Lord will reinforce you with three thousand angels?"
Yes, if you are patient and Godwary, and the enemy of your Lord will come to you, and you will have come to you with five thousand angels.
And Allah has given you a good word, so that it may be a assurance for you, and that which is not for your hearts; and Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
And that He may cut off the punishment for their disbelief, so that they might return to the torment.
It is not for you to ask the reward of Allah, or whether He punishes them, or they are unjust.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and punishes whomever He pleases. And Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
O you who believe! Devour not usury, and consume usury, and fear Allah, that haply ye may prosper.
And guard yourselves from the Fire, prepared for the unbelievers.
And obey Allah and His Messenger, and that you may receive mercy.
And as for forgiveness for forgiveness, and a mercy from your Lord, and the Garden and the earth, prepared for the godfearing.
Those who spend in prosperity and adversity, and restrain the anger of Allah, and restrain the anger of Allah; and Allah loves the righteous.
And those who do wrong their harm, when they commit wrong, and remember Allah's command, and do not forgive the sins of those who do wrong, and do not forgive the sins of Allah?
Their reward shall be forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of the workers.
Many of you have passed away before you. So travel in the land and see the fate of the deniers.
This is a reminder for mankind, and a guidance and a admonition for the believers.
And do not grieve nor grieve, and if you are believers, you are believers.
If a wound befalls you, there is a wound for them, and We have destroyed them, and We have appointed examples to those who have been given people, and We have appointed the people of the believers. God does not love the unjust.
And that Allah may purge the believers and the unbelievers.
Do you think that you will enter the garden that Allah has promised you? They are steadfast in Allah and His Messenger, and they are steadfast.
You were longing for death before you, and you were lost, and you were lost.
Muhammad is not the Messenger, but he has passed before him before him, but he dies, and then he dies, and then turn back before his heels, and he will not harm any harm nor harm, and Allah will give him a great reward.
It is not for any soul to die except by Allah's leave, but if He wills, He will give life for him. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We shall give him the reward of this world, and We will give him the reward of the Hereafter.
And many a prophet We have destroyed before those who were fought before, but they were smitten by the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, nor did they weaken, and Allah loves the steadfast.
And they said, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses, and forgive us our sins and help us with the disbelievers.
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the Hereafter; and Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn back from your heels, and then turn back.
Indeed, Allah is your Guardian, and He is the Best of Helpers.
But they disbelieved in their hearts, so that they have no partner to Allah. He has not sent down any authority to them, and for them is the abode of the Fire; and evil is the evil abode.
And Allah has promised you the truth, and He has made you appear to you, and He has made you appear to you, and He has endeared you to you. Some of you have been oppressed in this world, and after you would have been made to gain you. But if you were grateful, He would give you a great punishment. And if you have done, you would have been better to you. And if you are believers, and Allah has excused you to the believers.
And when you were not in any side, and when you were a enemy from the rear, and the rear was calling you, so that you might not grieve in the rear, so that you might be paid back to you, so that you might grieve in what you have given you. Indeed, Allah is aware of what you do.
And when He came to you, he took them into the state, and they said: "This is what we have been doing." They said, "We have no power in this." They said, "If we have stayed back in this, we would not have left it." They said, "We have stayed back in this." They said, "We have stayed in your homes." Say, "God knows what you do." He knows that which is in the breasts. He knows what is in their hearts, and He knows what you do.
Those of you who turned away on the day when the two armies met, so that Satan might make them slip for them, and they would not be able to hide it. God is forgiving and forbearing.
O you who believe! When they have disbelieved in the cause of the disbelievers, they would not have died in the land, but if they were killed, they would say, "Had not been slain," they would have been killed in the land, and they would have been killed in the way of Allah. God will give life to the dead, and He will give life to the dead. God is Seer of what you do.
And if you are killed in the way of Allah, or strive in the cause of Allah, and forgiveness from Allah and His forgiveness, and a great reward.
And if you do not die or die, then surely Allah will be gathered to all that you do.
It is because of Allah's mercy upon you, so that you may be lenient with them, and if you were patient, they would surely have deserted you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and ask forgiveness for them. And if you turn away, then put your trust in Allah; and Allah loves those who trust.
If Allah supports you, no one can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, He will help you, if you are believers? And in Allah let the believers put their trust.
It is not for any prophet to defraud himself, and whoever defrauds will be recompensed for his soul, and every soul will be recompensed for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah and he who incurs the displeasure of Allah, he shall be his abode in the Fire, and his destination is Hell?
They are in ranks in Allah's sight, and Allah sees what they do.
Indeed, Allah has conferred a favour to those who believe in Allah, and gave them His revelations, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom, although they were in clear error.
And if you had a affliction, or twice befell you, you would say, "This is a great thing." Say, "This is from you." Say, "God has power over all things."
And on the day when the two parties met, the two armies met the command of Allah, and that He might test the believers.
And even for those who were hypocrites in the way of Allah, they say: "Come to us in the way of Allah." They said: "If we were slain, we would not have been slain." They said, "Had we been slain in the way of the believers, and they would have been followed in the hearts of the believers." They are their hearts. God knows what they conceal.
Those who have lost their wealth, and they were killed, "Had we listened to us, they would not have been slain." Say, "Then you are truthful."
And do not think in the way of Allah, but they are dead. They are alive, and they are in a generous provision.
They rejoice in what Allah has given them, and those who do not believe in what they have been given, and they have no fear, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice from Allah and His bounty, and Allah will not be of the believers.
Those who responded to Allah and His Messenger, and did good deeds, they shall have a reward and a great reward.
Those to whom the people said, "He has gathered you." But they have believed in their faith, and they said: "Allah is Sufficient for us." And Allah is Sufficient and Sufficient.
So they returned upon Allah and His grace, and had touched them from a good punishment. And Allah is the possessor of mighty grace.
This is Satan frightening the Satan, so let them not fear them, and fear Me, so fear Me, and fear Me.
And do not grieve for those who deny the truth, and do not harm any harm, but Allah will not harm them, but they will be given to life in this world and in the Hereafter.
Those who do not believe in the price of the believers, and they will not harm Allah, and theirs is a painful punishment.
And let not those who disbelieve think that We respite them, but We respite them for them, and We shall make them taste a humiliating punishment.
It is not for you to believe in Allah in the cause of Allah, and He has given you a good way. And those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and do not know what Allah has sent down from His servants, and that Allah chooses, and believe in His apostles. And if you believe in Allah and His Noble Messenger, you shall have a great reward.
And do not think of those who have no knowledge in Allah's bounty, but they have no knowledge, but they have no good in what they have earned, and that which they have earned, and that which is in the heavens and the earth; and Allah is the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Allah has said to those who say: "Allah is poor, and we are rich." They said, "We have heard the wealth of the prophets." And We shall say, "Taste the punishment of the Fire."
That is because of what your hands have sent before; and Allah is not unjust to His servants.'
They say, "We believe in Allah that we should not believe in it." Say, "The Messenger has come to us, and the Messenger came to you with clear proofs. Have you come to tell you what you were truthful?"
And if they belie you, then those before you denied before them, and those who came before you and the illuminating Book.
Every soul will taste death, and you will be paid back to you, and you will be paid back to the Day of Resurrection, and he will be admitted to the Fire, and he will be admitted back to the Fire, and the enjoyment of this world is nothing but delusion.
They will surely be tried in your possessions and your lives, and those who were given the Book before you, and those who were given the Book before you, and they were lost, and if you were patient, and patient, and Allah is the best of all things.
And when it was said to them, 'Come to the Book, and do not make it forget it.' And it was an evil price, and they turned away from their backs and sold it, and sold it for what they sold.
Do not think that those who exult in what they have done, and do not think of them, and do not believe in the way of Allah. For them is a painful punishment.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has power over all things.
Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day, and in the alternation of night and day.
They remember Allah and standing in the sides of the night, and when they are in the darkness of the heavens and the earth, and they say, "Our Lord! You have created us from Thee. Glory be to Thee! You have created us from the torment of the Fire."
"Our Lord! Thou hast made the Fire to enter, and Thou art the helpers of the Fire."
Our Lord, we have heard the caller calling calling to our faith, and say, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins, and forgive us our sins and admit us to the righteous of the righteous."
Our Lord, give us what Thou hast promised us, and humiliate us to the Day of Resurrection. You shall not be raised."
Then, when they return to their Lord, they said: "Do not be able to tempt me." And he will be among them a kind of the Sacred Mosque, and they will enter the Sacred Mosque, and they will dwell in the dwellings of the Sacred Mosque, and they will dwell in the dwellings of the Sacred Mosque, and they will abide in the Garden, and to dwell in the Gardens of Eden. That is the reward of Allah.
Do not be impressed in the land, and do not be among the disbelievers.
This is but a little enjoyment; and their abode is Hell; and evil is the destination.
But as for those who fear their Lord, they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of Allah, and a goodly reward.
And those who have been given the Book in the Book and that which has been revealed to you, and that which has been revealed to you and that which Allah has sent down for those who believe in Allah and the remembrance of Allah, for them is their reward; and Allah is swift in reckoning.
O you who believe! endure, and be patient, and be patient, and fear Allah, and that you may prosper.
O you who have believed! Fear your Lord who created you from a single soul, then He created from the clot, and created you in pairs and blood, and do not walk in the name of Allah. So fear Allah, and know that Allah is over all things.
And give the orphans to the orphans, and do not consume the property of their property, and do not consume the property of their property. Indeed, it is a great sin.

And if you do not know, he will bequeath it to his own accord, and if you do not know the marriage's property, and if it is to eat, and if you do not know it, then if it is a sin, then if you are to eat it, and if you do not know it, it is better than you. But if you are a sign to the believers, he will have given you a sign. That is the law of Allah. He is the Wise, the Wise.
There is no blame for you that if you do not have any means of marriage, unless you have married, and do not touch them until he has touched them, and if they have no means of marriage, he will not be able to be able to marry him. And if they do not do, he will have no means of marriage, nor shall he be able to do a year, and if it is a sin, and he should have no means of his own accord. And if they are a good thing, he will have no sin in his capacity. And if they are a good thing, he will have no sin in his capacity. And if he is a sin, then he is a sin in the land. God is All-forgiving and All-knowing.
These are the limits of Allah and His Messenger, and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. That is the supreme triumph.
But whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, and transgresses, and transgresses him, He will admit him into the Fire, and there is a humiliating punishment.
And if you among your women commit lewdness, then produce four witnesses against them. If they testify against the witnesses, then detain them with four lashes, and if they testify, confine them to Allah's way.

Allah does not wrong the weight of a atom's weight; and if He does good, He will multiply it with a goodly reward and a great reward.

Or do they have a share in the kingdom? If they have a share, they would have no power in the land.
Or do they envy that which they have been given, and that Allah has bestowed upon them a favor from His grace? And We gave him the Book and wisdom, and We gave him the kingdom of the Mighty and the Wise.
Some of them have believed in it, and some of them believe in it, and some of them are the Fire.
Indeed, those who reject Our revelations, then We shall cast them into a Fire, and We will replace them with their skins, and We will replace them from the skins of the skins. Indeed, Allah is all-mighty, all-wise.
And those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall abide therein forever, and We shall make them enter the shade.

O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and the Messenger, if ye dispute with you. And if you dispute in Allah and His Messenger, then if you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the best of the Hereafter is better.
Have you not seen those who believe in what has been sent down to you, and those who have been given the Book before them? They desire that they should lead themselves away from their own souls. But Satan desires to lead them astray.
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down, and obey the Messenger, and you are hypocrites."
How how will it be, when disaster befalls them, and what smote them because of what they had earned, and they said, “What is the matter of Allah?”
These are the ones who have hearts in what they have done. So admonish them, and admonish them, and tell them that they may hear.
And We did not send any Messenger except by Allah's leave, but if they had wronged themselves, they would not have wronged themselves; and if they were asked to forgive you, Allah would ask forgiveness for forgiveness for His forgiveness, and He would forgive them, and He was the Most Merciful, the Merciful.
But you will not believe in your Lord until they have disputed about the truth, so that you may judge between them, and they would not believe in it.
And if We had sent down to them (O Muhammad SAW): "Slay your wives or your habitations." They would not have done it, but they would not have done it. But if they had done it, they would have been better than it, and would have been better-doers.
And We would have given them a great reward.
And We guided them to a Straight Path.

And there is some of you who lag behind, and if a misfortune befalls you, he says: "I have been given to me, and I would not have been given a thing."
And if a favor from Allah from you had touched you, he would say, "Oh, if I had been a friend, I would have been better than it."
So let those who fight in the way of Allah in the life of this world, or strive in the life of this world, or strive in the way of Allah. And whoever fights in the way of Allah, shall be victorious and a great reward.
And what is it that you should fight in the cause of Allah, and the weak, and women, and children, and children, who said, "Our Lord! Liberate us from this town of oppressive, and appoint us from Yourself, and appoint a protector from Thee, and help us from the righteous."
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and fight in the way of Allah. So fight in the way of Satan. Indeed, Satan is weak and weak.
O you who have seen! When they were told to kill their Lord, they would be paid back to you, and when they were the needy, and the needy, and the needy, and the needy, saying, "Woe to us!" And when they were told, they will say, "Our Lord, grant us a little, and give us good, and give us a little life." They will say, "This is a good life."
Wherever you may die, you will die, and if you are content, they are content, but if a misfortune befalls you, they say, "This is from Allah." But if a misfortune befalls them, they say: "This is from Allah." Say, "This is from Allah." But most of them do not understand.
Whatever good befalls you is from Allah, and whatever befalls you, then it is evil for you, and We have sent you a messenger, and Allah is sufficient as a Witness.
Those who obey the Messenger, and whoever obeys Allah, he will have no authority over you.
And they say, "We have listened to a great time." But when they turn away, they say, "There is no planning in night." But when they conspire in the matter of Allah, they plan their plan, and turn away from Him. God is sufficient as a Guardian.
Do they not ponder in the Qur'an? Had it been from Allah, they would surely have found a discrepancy in it.
And when a affliction comes to them, they will not have come to it, and if they had referred it to the Messenger, they would have followed it, and if they had believed in it, they would have been better than it; and if it had been for the grace of Allah and His mercy, they would surely have followed a few of you, and he would have followed Satan a few.
So fight in the way of Allah, for you are not responsible for you. But rouse the unbelievers, and fight in Allah's cause. Allah is Stronger and in the world, and He is the mighty, the mighty.
Whoever does a good deed shall have a share of his own soul; and whoever intercedes with a good deed will have a share of it; and Allah has power over all things.
And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet not better than it, or be patient. Allah is the Reckoner of all things.

Do you think that you should be divided in the two parties, and Allah has made their hands appear to them? What, do you want to guide the way of Allah? God will guide them from the way of Allah, and whomever you find a way.
They wish that you may disbelieve in the way of the unbelievers, and they have no power over them. So if they turn away, then they will fight in the way of Allah; and if they turn away, then slay them, and slay them wherever you find them, and slay them wherever they find a friend.
Except those who have gone away from among you, and you have not come to you, until you have no faith in their hearts. And if they fight from you, then fight in their homes, and if they fight against you, then fight against them; and if they fight against you, then fight against them; and if they fight against you, then fight against them; and if you fear them, they will not find a way.
And they will find for you a portion of security. And if they turn away from you, they turn away from them, and do not turn away from them; and if they turn away, they will not be able to kill you; and if they turn away from you, they will kill you wherever you have killed them, and kill them, and We have sent you a clear authority.

And if he who kills a believer intentionally, he shall abide forever, and he will abide in the Fire, and Allah has cursed him and prepared for him a terrible punishment.
O you who believe, if you are killed in the way of Allah, and do not say, and say, “We are better than you, and you will not enter the life of this world, and do not say to those who have been given you, and you will surely have been slain in this world, and remember Allah’s favour.” But Allah has conferred His favour upon you, and that you may know.
They are not equal to those who fight in the way of Allah, and they strive in the cause of Allah. They strive in the cause of Allah, and strive in the cause of Allah, and strive in the cause of Allah, and strive in the cause of Allah. And those who strive with the cause of Allah, and are patient.

And do not judge in what Allah has sent down, and that which is revealed to them, and that Allah has not sent down to the believers.
And indeed, We have revealed to you the Book, confirming the Book, confirming what is revealed to you, and follow what is revealed to you, and follow what is revealed to you, and follow the desires of those who follow the Book. Had you wished, He would have given you a little, and He would have given you what He has given you. And you will be returned to God, and He will inform you of what you used to differ.
And judge between them with what Allah has sent down, and follow what is revealed to you, and do not follow their desires; and if you turn away from them, they will not be able to obey you. But if you turn away, then know that Allah will punish them for their sins, and most of them are transgressors.
Or do they have a judgement and the judgement? What is the matter of those who believe?
O you who believe! Do not befriend the Jews and the Christians, but they are friends of friends. And if you are friends, then surely, Allah guides the unjust.
And those who are in whose hearts are disease in the disease, and they say, "We fear lest a misfortune may befall us." But it is a sickness that Allah may bring a victory or a victory. God will bring it back to a while, and they will be remorseful about what they used to do.
And those who believe will say, "Are these the ones who swore against Allah with their strongest oaths?" They will surely have lost, and they will be lost.
O you who believe! If you turn away from a way, he will have his faith, and those who believe in Allah and strive in the way of Allah, and they strive in the way of Allah, and they strive in the cause of Allah, and will fear it. Allah is Ample and wise.
Indeed, those who believe and obey Allah and His Messenger, and those who are steadfast and pay the poor-rate and pay the poor-rate.
And whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, and the believers, and Allah is the victorious.
O you who believe! Do not befriend those who have been given the Book and those who have been given the Book before you and those who have been given the Book before you, and fear Allah, if you are believers.
And when you call to prayer, they ridicule it, and they are a people who are heedless.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book (Jews and Christians)! Do you resent us except that which Allah has sent down to us, and that which has been revealed to us, and that we may believe in Allah and that which was revealed to us?"
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Shall I am better than you than that which Allah has sent for you? Those who have rejected Allah's wrath, and those who have incurred apes and swine, and Satan's wrath and those who have gone astray from apes and swine."
And when they come to you, they say, "We believe in it." And they disbelieved in the truth, and Allah knows what they say.
And you see many of them hastening in sin and forbid sin, and forbid what is forbidden, and evil is what they used to do.
And do not be the rabbis and the rabbis and the rabbis, and what their hearing and their children have been forbidden? Evil is what they do.
And those who said, "Allah is the All-merciful, and He has no power over him, and He will make you appear away from the Day of Resurrection." They are the people who were in the life of the Day of Resurrection, and the other-place, and the other, and the earth, and the other, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and the earth, and Allah's cause is spacious; and Allah does not love the earth.
And if the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We would surely have remitted their sins and admitted them to the Gardens of Delight.
And if they had been given the Torah and the Gospel, and that which was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have consumed from their heads, and some of them go astray; and many of them are evil.
O Prophet! Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, so if you do not believe, then, if you have been sent away to you, then surely Allah will protect you from His mercy. And Allah guides not the people of the unbelievers.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "People of the Book (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Gospel (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Gospel (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), and what has been revealed to you (i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), and the Injeel (Gospel), and those who do not believe in what has been sent down to you, and those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah) and do not turn away from the disbelievers.
Those who believe and follow the Jews and the Christians, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do righteousness, and do not fear nor shall they grieve.
And We gave Moses the Children of Israel, and We sent with them a messenger, and We sent to them a messenger, and they disbelieved not, but they rejected him.
And they had no longing in this, but they became blind and blind. But Allah turned away from them, and turned away from them, and turned away from them; and Allah sees all that they do.
Indeed, those who disbelieve said, "God is the son of Maryam." They said, "God's son, and your Lord, and your brothers, and your brothers, and the Messiah, and the wayfarer, and the God-fearing, and the God-fearing, and the God-fearing, and the curse of Allah, and the wrong-doers."
Those who say, "Allah is the third of a trinity." There is no god but He. There is no god but He. So if they do not kill them, they will have a painful punishment.
Will they not then repent and ask forgiveness for Allah? And if Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Maryam, was not a warner before him, and before the people of Abraham, and before him, and his mother, who ate him. See how We make them clear signs, so that they turn away.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Do you worship besides Him that which is no benefit for you? And do not benefit for any harm nor benefit, nor do you love, and He is all-hearing, all-knowing."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O People of the Book, do not exceed the bounds of your religion, and follow not the desires of those who went astray before, and led astray before the people of the Right Path."
And the children of Israel who disbelieved in the Children of Israel, and Jesus, son of Maryam, son of Maryam, son of Maryam, and because they were transgressors.
They did not forbid one another, but they used to commit evil.
You will see many of them befriending unbelievers. Evil is what they have earned, and that which they have earned. They will abide in the Fire.
And if they had believed in Allah and His Messenger, and would not be helped, they would have taken friends for friends, but most of them are believers.
Some of you are those who believe in the cause of the Jews and the Christians, and they say, "We are Christians," they say, "We are Christians." There is a matter between them and monks, and they are not arrogant.
And when they hear that which has been sent down to the Messenger, they see thee, and they recognize what they say: "Our Lord, we believe in that we believe, and bear us with the witnesses."
“And why should we not believe in Allah and in the truth that has come to us, and we have believed in our Lord?”
So they will be told to enter Allah's gates and gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the reward of the righteous.
But those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, they are the companions of the Fire.
O you who believe! do not prohibit the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not exceed the limits. Indeed, Allah does not like the transgressors.
And eat of the lawful and the good things which Allah has provided for you; and be wary of Allah, if you are believers.
It is not for you to take your oaths in Allah's oaths, nor your oaths, or that you may be able to take your homes, or that you may be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take your homes. This is the same for you, that you may be able to do that which you have earned, and that you may know that it may be a expiation for you, and that you may know it. This is that which you have been doing.
O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, gambling, and divining arrows are abominations, and divining arrows are abominations. Avoid them, so that you may prosper.
Satan wants to tempt you from wine and gambling, and gambling, and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah; and do you not abstain?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and obey the Messenger. If you turn away, then know that Our duty is only to convey the message.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, they shall not be wronged, nor did they believe, and do good deeds, and fear Allah, and do good deeds; and Allah loves those who believe and do good deeds; and Allah loves the righteous.
O you who believe! When you are able to do in Allah's cause, then know that which is in your hands, and that Allah may test those who fear Him, so that he may be mindful of it; and whoever transgresses in his way, he is a painful punishment.
O you who believe, do not approach the pilgrimage, and when you do not die, and you have bathed. And if you have bathed, he will not be able to make any testament to the needy, unless he may be in accordance in his capacity; and whoever is in the law of Allah, he will have no share in this; and whoever is given his hands in this year, he will be in his hands; and Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Lawful to you is the game of the sea and the food of the sea, and to the travellers, and to the travellers, and to the travellers, and the game of the land, and the wayfarer, and the wayfarer, and fear Allah, and to Him you shall be gathered.
Allah has appointed the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, and the Sacred House, and the Sacred House, and the garlands, and the garlands, and the wayfarer, and that you may know that you know what is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and Allah is Knowing of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger is only a warner, and Allah knows what you do.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "The good and the good are not equal to the bad, and the abundance of the bad. So fear Allah, and fear that you may be successful."
O you who believe! do not ask the things that which you have sent down to you, but if you ask it, they would not ask it about you. And if you ask the Qur'an, they will ask it about you. God is Forgiving and Forbearing.
The people of your people had come to you, but they disbelieved in it.
Allah has not appointed for you a bahirah or Bahira, nor is the name of the spider's name. They have lied against Allah, but most of them do not know.
And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has sent down, and say, "We found our fathers following this, and we found our fathers following it, and we did not understand."
O you who believe, do not make your own souls, and if you go astray, you will not be able to lead you astray. God is your Guardian, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
O ye who believe! When ye find a portion of the journey, ye shall be driven forth in the land, and if ye are driven forth, and if ye are in the land, ye will not be able to feed you. And if they are told, he will say, "Do not be able to feed the poor." And if they are a child, he will say, "This is a covenant."
And if it is said to them, the two-doers, and the two women, they are two than two women, and they swear in the way of Allah, saying, "Our testimony is truer than our testimony, and we have not transgressed against our testimony. Indeed, we are guilty of the unjust."
That is because they should not be able to hide the testimony, nor will they be able to hide it. So fear Allah and fear the truth; and Allah guides not the people of the ungodly.
On the Day when Allah will gather the angels and those who were before them, say: "What is the response that you used to say?" They will say: "We have no knowledge."
And when Allah said, 'Jesus, son of Maryam, and my mother, and I have delivered him, so that I may make him a sign.' And the disciples said, 'I am commanded to kill you.' And when the disciples came to you, and the mother of the disciples, and said: 'I will make it a clear place.' The disciples said, 'I have made it clear to you, and I have made it a sign, and the prophets, and the prophets, and I gave you the signs, and the apostles, so that you may see.'
And when I said to the disciples, 'Believe in Me, and follow the Messenger, and say, 'We believe in that which I have been sent, and we are believers'
And when the disciples said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary! shall we send down to us a table from heaven from heaven?' He said, “Fear Allah, if you are believers.”
They said: "We will eat from it and that which is in our hearts, and that we may give us the truth and that we may be witnesses."
Jesus, son of Mary, said, "Our Lord, send down from us a table from heaven, and a sign for us, and the last of us, and the last of us, and the last of us, and to give us a sign, and You are the best of providers."
Allah said, “I have sent you down to you, and whoever disbelieves, then I will surely punish him, and I will not punish anyone of the punishment of a great punishment.”
And when Allah said to him, son of Mary, son of Mary, said: "I am my helpers in the presence of Allah?" He said: "I do not believe in Allah." He said: "I do not know what you do not know, and I do not know what you did not know. I know what you do, and I know what you do."
I have not heard me except that I should not be able to serve me. I have commanded me to worship the Lord of my Lord. I have made them a long time, and I have made them a watcher over them, and You are all-knowing and all things.
If You punish them, they would have no power, and forgive them. You are the All-mighty, the All-wise."
Allah will say, "This is the Day of which they will be promised, and they will abide in gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will abide therein forever. God is pleased with them, and He is pleased with them."
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and He is Able to do all things.
All praise is to Allah, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and made darkness and light. Yet those who disbelieve equalise with their Lord.
It is He who created you from dust, then appointed a term, then appointed a term between you; then most of you are truthful.
And He it is Who is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you hide and what you disclose.
And a sign from their Lord comes to them, but they turn away from it.
But they rejected the truth when it came to them, so that they may come to know the truth.
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them? We destroyed them in the land, and We sent down rain from the sky, and We sent down rain from the sky, and We destroyed them for their sins. Then We destroyed them for their sins, and We destroyed them.
And if We had sent down to you a Book, then they would have touched it, and they would say: "This is only a clear magic."
They say, "Why has not a angel been sent down to him?" Had We sent down a angel, it would have been revealed to them, and they would not have been reprieved.
And had We made him a angel, he would have made him a man, and We would have made them confusion in it.
And indeed We mocked before you (O Muhammad SAW), but those who scoffed before them had mocked at them.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Travel in the land and see how was the end of the rejecters."
Say, "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth?" Say, "To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He will surely gather you to the Day of Resurrection, and they will not believe."
And to Him belongs whatever is in the night and the day. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "There is no god but Allah, Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "He is He Who feeds for you, and gives to the earth and the earth, and I am commanded to be of those who submit."
Say, "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of the Great Day."
On that day he will be averted from Allah, and He is the Most Merciful.
And if Allah touches you with affliction, there is no remover for you; then if He touches you, He will remove it; and He is Able to do all things.
He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Say, "I do not believe in what you say, and I have no knowledge." Say, "I have been revealed to you, and what has been revealed to me." Say, "I have no knowledge other than Allah." Say, "I do not serve any other than Allah." Say, "There is no god but He, and I am with those who deny Him."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own sons. They have lost themselves, but they do not believe.
Who does greater wrong than he who forges a lie against Allah, or denies the truth? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not prosper.
And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, and say to those who associated others with Allah, "Where are you whom you used to claim?"
And they will not say, "He is our Lord, and we were not polytheists."
See how they lie against falsehood, and that which they used to invent.
And among them are he who listen to their hearts, and deafness in their ears, and deafness in their ears. But if they come to you, they will not believe in it. But if they come to you, they say, "This is nothing but tales of us." They say, "This is nothing but tales of the ancients."
And they turn away from it, and they turn away from it, and they are not aware.
If you could see, when they see the Fire, they will say, "Oh, would we wish that we would have been returned to our Lord, and that we might be among the believers?"
Nay, but they had lost that which they had been concealing, and that which they had been wont to come to them, and they were liars, and they were liars.
And they say, "There is nothing but our life in this world, and we will not be resurrected."
And if they see the Day of Judgment, they will not be able to say, "Is this not real?" They will say, "Yes," and they will say: "Yes," and the truth will say: "Taste now the torment, if you used to deny."
Those who deny the meeting of Allah will have come to them, and when the Hour comes to them, they will say, "Woe to us!" They will say, "Woe to us!" They will bear their burdens and their backs. Evil is what they used to do.
The life of this world is but a sport and a diversion and a sport and a abode for those who believe. Will you not then understand?
We know what they say, and you will not grieve them; and they say, “Indeed, the signs of Allah is the unjust.”
Indeed, We were messengers before you before you, and they were patient, until they were patient, until they had gone away before, and they were not able to alter the Words of Allah; and there is no changing you who is the messengers.
And if they turn away from the earth, then if thou art a ladder to the earth, or a ladder for a ladder to the earth, and if they bring a sign to you, they would not believe in it; and if Allah had willed, He would have guided them, and that they may be admonished.
Those who listen to the truth, and who are dead, and Allah will raise them to the Day of Resurrection.
They say, "Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "Indeed, Allah has sent down a sign, but most of them do not know.
There is not a animal in the earth, nor are its wings in the earth; and you are divided in the Book. We have neglected that which is in the Book, and they will be gathered to their Lord.
Those who reject Our revelations are deaf and dumb, and they are deaf in darkness. God guides whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me, if Allah's punishment comes upon you, or the Hour will overtake you, if you are truthful?"
Nay, but, if you call upon Him, He will remove it, but if He wills, He will remove that which you associate with Him.
And indeed We sent before you (O Muhammad SAW), but We seized them (O Muhammad SAW), and We seized them with torment and hardship, so that they might humble themselves.
And why did they not, when Our wrath came to them, and they were averse to their hearts? So their hearts hardened, and Satan made them forget their evil deeds.
And when they forgot what they had been reminded, We opened the gates of their deeds. So when they were given to the extent, they would not have done it. So We seized them with utter destruction.
So the people of the last remnant of those who were unjust, and the last of them, the Lord of the Universe, the Lord of all the worlds.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If you think, "If Allah's hearing and sight, and your hearing and your sight, and hearts, He would have sealed your hearts, so that He may make clear to you any signs?" Thus, then, they turn away.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you, or the punishment of the wrong-doers?"
And We send the Noble Messengers with a bearer of glad tidings and warners, and those who believe and do righteous deeds, and they shall not be saddened.
And as for those who reject Our revelations, they shall suffer a humiliating punishment.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what I say." Say: "I do not know what is revealed to me." Say, "I am only a angel." Say, "Will I not follow the blind and the blind?"
And warn those who fear that which they have been promised, and they have no protector beside Allah, and they have no protector.
And do not ask those who call to their Lord morning and evening, and do not ask any portion of what they have earned. You do not ask any account for you, and you will be among them accountable.
And We caused some of them some of others, and they say: "Is this a one that Allah has given to us?" Does they not know that Allah does not know the grateful?
And when Our revelations are recited to you, they say, "Peace be to you! Your Lord has mercy for you." Whoever commits a evil deed, then whoever repents and reforms, then repents, then He is Forgiving and Merciful.
Thus do We explain the signs, and that We may make it clear.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Call to those whom you invoke besides Allah (Alone), and I do not follow my religion." Say, "I do not follow my desires, and I will not be guided."
Say, "I have come to you from clear proofs, and I will not be able to ask you." Say, "I have no power to help you with Allah. He is the Best of judges."
Say, "If what you wish to hasten, I would not be able to ask me, and if I had done a judgement between me and me, and Allah knows best those who do wrong."
And to Him are the keys of the unseen. He knows what is in the land and what is in the sea. No leaf falls in the darkness of the land and the sea. No leaf falls in the darkness of the land, nor is there a grain of grain.
It is He who makes you taste the night, and He knows what is in the day, and He has appointed for you a appointed term, and He has appointed for you a appointed term. Then to Him you will return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.
It is He who has given His servants over you, and He sends guardians to you, then He sends you back to a man, and We shall not neglect him, but they are heedless.
Then they will be returned to Allah, their Lord, the True, the True, the Great.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Who delivers you from the sea and sea, and sea on the sea, and call to you, and call to you." If they say, "We will surely be grateful."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Verily, Allah delivers you from every distress, and He saves you from that which ye associate.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "He will send down upon you from your feet a portion from the sky, or from your feet, and have made some of you taste the other, and We have made you taste it, so that We may make you taste a trial. Thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)."
And your people (O Muhammad SAW) have come to you (O Muhammad SAW), and the truth (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], "I am not responsible with you."
For every prophecy there is a appointed term.
And if you see those who gossip in Our verses, they turn away from them. So if you turn away from them, they will not turn away from you. So do not sit away in the way of the unjust.
And those who do not believe in what they have earned, and fear that they may be mindful.
And to those who have lost the way of the Hereafter, and the Hereafter, and the Hereafter, and the Hereafter, and those who have no protectors in the life of the world, and they have no protectors besides Allah, and they will not be able to protect them from Allah; and if they see it, they will be given their hands, and they will have a draught of boiling water, and for them is a shameful punishment.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If we should save us from Allah's way, we will not believe in us, and we would not believe in Allah, and we would not be able to believe in the way of our Lord." They will say, "If we are guided to the right path, we would not believe in it." Say, "So follow Allah, and we submit to the truth."
And be wary of Allah and fear Him, and to Him you shall be gathered.
It is He who has created the heavens and the earth in truth. He will say: "This is the Day of Resurrection." He will say: "The Day of Resurrection is the truth, and the Day when the trumpet will be sounded, and what is in the heavens and the earth, and He is the All-wise, the All-wise."
And when Abraham said to his father Azar, “Do you worship idols? Indeed, I see you in a clear error.”
And We gave him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that they had been convinced.
When the night came to him, he saw a star. He said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "I do not think this."
And when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "If my Lord does not guide me, I would surely be of the astray."
When he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "O my people, I am quit of what you associate.
I have made me the religion of the heavens and the earth, and I am not a idol worshipper.
And his people argued with him. He said: "Do you think that you have no partners to me? But I have no power to worship Allah, unless He wills." He said: "Only my Lord is All-Aware. He knows what you do not know."
And should I fear that which you have not associated with Him, nor do you not fear Him? Do you not know that Allah has sent down to you a authority? Will you not then be among the two-doers?
Those who believe and do not believe in the faith, and they have no faith.
This is Our argument that We gave Abraham to his people. We raise them to whom We will. Indeed, He is the All-wise, the All-wise.
And We gave him Ishaq and Yaqoub, and Jacob, and Jacob, and Jacob, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses, and Moses, and Aaron, and Aaron, and Aaron, and We gave the gooddoers.
And Zakariya and John, and Elias, and Elias, and Elias was one of the righteous.
And Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot, and Lot, and We gave to the worlds.
And their fathers and their brothers and their brethren, and We chose them and guided them to a straight path.
This is the guidance of Allah. He whom He sendeth astray, He will have guided them, and they would have lost what they used to earn.
These are the ones whom We gave the Book, and We gave them the Book, and if they believe in it, they believe in it, and they disbelieve in it.
Those are they whom Allah has guided, and follow them. Say, "I ask you no reward for it, but it is only a reminder for all things."
And they say, "Allah has not taken down a thing, nor has He revealed to Him." Say, "Do not know what has been revealed to you, and what has been revealed to you, and what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to you?" Say, "God has revealed to you what you did not know."
And this is a Book which We have sent down to you, confirming that which is before it, and that which is before it and that which is before it and that which is in the Hereafter, and that they may believe in the Hereafter, and they are heedless of it.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or he said, "Why has I not been sent down to me?" Say, "It is not for me to be a Messenger." Say, "It is Allah who has sent down the Book, and has not sent down to you the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, so that you may see the punishment." And the punishment of your Lord, and you were arrogant.
"And we were not like a man that has come to you, and We have created you, and We have not created you, and We have not made you equal to you, and We have not made you equal to you, and you have lost you in the lurch, and you have lost you in the lurch.
It is Allah who splits the grain and the date-stone, and brings forth the living from the dead, and the dead from the living, and He is the Bringer from the dead. Will you then turn away?
It is He who splits the dawn, and appointed the night, and the sun and the moon, and the sun and the moon. That is the ordaining of the All-knowing, the All-knowing.
And He it is Who has appointed for you the night and the sea, that ye may walk in the sea; and We have detailed the signs for a people who know.
It is He who has produced you from a single soul, and made it a lodging for you, and a depository, and a repository for those who have knowledge.
And He it is Who sends down water from the sky, and therewith We produce therewith water, and We produce therewith crops of water, and We produce therewith crops of palm trees, and olives, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates, and pomegranates. There is no fruit in the fruit of those who believe.
And they have taken up compeers to Him that He created them, and He created what they have created, and they impute to Him sons and daughters. Glory be to Him, and exalted is He above what they describe.
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. He has not taken a son, nor has He a son, and He has power over all things, and He has knowledge of all things.
That is Allah, your Lord. There is no god but He. So serve Him, and He is the Guardian of all things.
No eyes can grasp Him, but He sees it. He is the Subtle, the Expert.
Indeed, your Lord has come to you from a clear proof. So whoever turns away, it is for his own soul, and whoever remains blind, then I am not a guardian over you.
Thus do We make clear Our verses to them, that they may say: "You have studied." And We have explained it to a people who know it.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He, and turn away from the polytheists.
And if Allah had willed, they would not have associated others with Him, and We have not made you a watcher over them, and We have not made you a watcher over them.
Do not abuse those who invoke besides God, lest they do not abuse Him. Thus, We have made their deeds seem attractive to them, and We have made them taste their deeds. Their Lord will inform them their deeds.
And they swear by Allah with solemn oaths that if a sign came to them, they would say, "This is a sign that has been sent down to you." Say, "In fact, it is a sign for you that you may believe in it."
And We will put up their hearts and their hearts, and they will not believe in it, and We shall make them wander in their insolence.
And if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead, and We would surely have gathered them together, and they would not have been able to stand in the land; and Allah would not believe in the believers.
And thus We have appointed every prophet from every man, and Satan, and jinn, and jinn. And if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it. So let them leave their word, so that they may fabricate themselves.
And those who do not believe in the Hereafter, so that they may incline to it, and they rejoice in it, and what they used to earn.
Say, "Shall I seek a god other than Allah?" Say, "I have been sent to the Book that has been revealed to you from your Lord, and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, so that you may be true."
The Word of your Lord is true and justice. None can change His Words. He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
And if you are in the earth, they would lead you astray from the way of God. They follow only assumptions, but they follow nothing but conjecture.
Your Lord knows best those who stray from His way, and He knows best those who are guided.
So eat of what Allah has given you, and do not be of the believers.
And what is you that you eat, that ye eat in the name of Allah, and that He has made lawful for you, that He may make lawful for you? And most of you are compelled in ignorance, but most of them exceed their own desires. And thy Lord knows best the transgressors.
And be patient, and converse in the sin of their sin; and what they earn shall be recompensed for what they used to earn.
And eat of that which is not lawful in the name of Allah, and do not eat the bounds, and do not follow the footsteps of their brothers. But if you obey them, they would surely obey you, and that you may be idolaters.
Is he who was dead, then We gave him the life of the life of the world, and he is given a light to light, or he who is given his light? Woe to those who deny the truth, so that they may be forgotten.
And thus have We made a town (of the city) a example, and We have made a plot to those who do wrong, and they do not understand.
And when a sign comes to them, they say, "We will not believe in it until we have been given Allah's Messengers." Allah knows best that which is in the land and that which is in Allah's wrath. So Allah will destroy the evil-doers.
And if Allah wills, He opens to him, and whomsoever He wills, he makes his breast narrow; and whomsoever He sendeth astray to him, he makes his breast strait to him. Thus Allah lays abomination to those who believe.
This is the Straight Path from your Lord. We have explained Our verses to a people who have faith.
For them is their Lord's Garden, and He is the Protector of what they used to do.
And on the Day when He will gather them all together, then say, "Our Lord, we have profited you in the earth." They will say, "Our Lord, we have profited us in this day, and we have reached us." They will say, "There is no place for us." He will say, "This is the place of your Lord. He is All-knowing and All-wise."
And those who were unjust to those who were unjust to the wrong-doers, so that they might be wronged.
“O you of jinn and humans, did you not come to you messengers from among you, and My messengers, and warning you before the Day of Resurrection?” They will say, “We have lost ourselves, and we will bear witness for the Day of Resurrection.” They were the ones who were faithless.
This is because your Lord would destroy the cities unjustly while they were unaware.
And each of them are whatever they have earned, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
And your Lord is the Most Merciful. If He wills, He will remove you, and if He wills, He will replace you from another, and He made you successors from the others.
Indeed, you will surely come to know, and you will not be able to escape.
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "O my people! Act according to my ability, and I am acting. Soon you will know who will be the end of the Hereafter, and the Hereafter will not be successful."
And they assign for Allah a portion of the land, and they say: "This is Allah's Name." They say: "This is what Allah has forbidden us." They will say, "Allah has forbidden us." They will say, "God has forbidden us." They have taken their share to Allah, and what they say.
And that they had found a share to those who have taken partners to Allah and their children, so that they might lead them to their religion, and they would not cease to be able to do them. So if Allah willed, they would have followed them. So let them go astray, and they will be lost.
And they say, "We are forbidden in the land and cattle, and we eat." They are forbidden to eat in the land, and forbidden to eat for cattle. They are forbidden to pronounce the name of God. They fabricate the name of God, and they fabricate to Allah what they fabricate.
And they say: "There is forbidden to eat in the bellies of our males and in the cattle." And if they are born, they will have been forbidden to eat. But if they are born, they will be given to them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
Those who have lost their wealth without knowledge, and do not lie in Allah's way, and Allah has given them their good deeds. They have lost themselves, and they are not guided.
And He it is Who produceth gardens trellised and untrellised, and date-palms, and crops, and crops, and crops and pomegranates, and the olive and the pomegranate, and the olive and the pomegranate, and the pomegranates, and the sea, and do not be wasteful. Indeed, Allah does not like the wasteful.
And of the cattle, We have made for you a ornament and the sea. Eat of God for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan, and follow the footsteps of Satan.
He has created two pairs of sheep and sheep, and eight of goats. Say: 'Is the two males and the two females, or the wombs of the two females? Inform me, if you are truthful?'
And a pair of oxen and a pair of oxen, and the oxen, and the oxen, and the wombs of the two females. Say: 'Is it that Allah has forbidden the two females, or the wombs of the two females? Or, do you not know that Allah has forbidden you to the wombs of the two females? But who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? But Allah guides not the unjust.
Say: 'I have been revealed to me except that which has been revealed to me, except carrion or blood, or that it may eat the flesh of swine, or that which is immolated to the name of Allah. There is no sin for you except that which is immolated to the name of Allah. But whoever does not exceed the bounds of necessity, then surely He is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And We forbade for the Jews and the sheep, and We forbade them the fat of sheep and sheep, and the fat of sheep and sheep, and the entrails, and the entrails, and the entrails, and the entrails, and We forbade them what they were doing.
And if they deny you, say, "The mercy of your Lord is from the mercy of a sinful people."
The polytheists will say, "Had Allah willed, we would not have associated others before Him, nor would we have forbidden anything." They were only lost before the people, and they tasted the punishment, and said, "You will follow what you have no knowledge. You are only guessing."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "If Allah had a conclusive argument, He would have guided you, and He guided you to a Straight Path."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Bring witness to your witnesses (i.e. the truth), and bear witness for you, and do not bear witness for those who deny the truth, and do not bear witness for those who deny the truth, and do not follow the Hereafter."
Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Tell me that your fathers has been forbidden to you, and that which is forbidden to you (i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), and do not kill your sons, and do not eat your wealth, and do not eat the property of the orphans, and do not eat (to eat). And do not exceed the bounds of Allah, and know the bounds of Allah. This is Allah's law, that you may understand."
And do not approach the property of the orphan, until he reaches maturity, and do not speak to the measure and the balance. And if you speak to him, We shall give him the measure and the balance, and do not speak to the poor. And if you speak to the poor, he will fulfill it, and fulfill the covenant of Allah, so that you may take heed.
And this is a straight path, so follow the path of your religion. So do not follow the path of your religion, so that you may follow the path of God, so that you may be Godwary.
Then We gave Moses the Book, a guidance, and a detailed explanation of all things, and a guidance and a mercy for those who believe in their Lord and believe in it.
This is a Book which We have revealed, so follow it, and be wary of the mercy of your Lord.
(O Prophet), say, "We have been revealed to the two parties before the two parties, and we have been sent down before it.
Or lest you should say, "If the Book had been sent down to us, we would have been better guided than it." And from your Lord's guidance, guidance, and guidance, and a guidance, and a sign from your Lord. So who turns away from Our verses and turns away from them?
Do they wait for you except that your Lord has come to them? The angels come to them from the Day of Judgment, and who will not believe in the signs of your Lord, and who will not believe in the Day of Judgment. Say, "Shall, we have believed in the faith."
Those who have divided their religion and became sects, and they have no knowledge of what they have done. God will inform them of what they used to do.
Whoever brings a good deed, it shall be a consequence for him; and whoever brings vice, it shall be recompensed for them, and they will not be wronged.
Say, "Indeed, my Lord has guided me to the Straight Path, the religion of Abraham, a Hanif, and he was not of the polytheists.
Say, “My prayer and my prayer, and my prayer, and my death, and my Lord, the Lord of the Worlds.”
He has no partner to me, and I am the first of me, and I am the first of the Muslims.
Say: 'Shall I seek a god other than Allah? He is the Lord of all things. He will judge for his own soul, and shall bear a burden for his own soul, and then you will inform your Lord, and He will inform you about what you used to differ.
And He it is Who has made you caliphs in the earth, and raised some of you above others, and He has given you some of the others that He may test you. He is your Lord, Most Compassionate, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.

And many a town We have destroyed, and We have destroyed it, until they slept at noon.
So when Our punishment came to them, they said, "This is nothing but our own-doing."

So We have given them knowledge and We have not been absent.
And the weighing on the Day of Judgment, that is the truth, and it is they who are the successful.
And as for those whose scale are light, they are those who have lost their souls, and they deny Our revelations.
And We have appointed for you in the earth a livelihood and made for you a livelihood for you, so that you may give thanks.
And indeed We created you, then We shaped you, and We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves before Adam”; and they bowed down, except Iblis, and he refused.
He said, “What prevented you from prostrating?” He said, “I am better than him. You created me from fire, and I created him from clay, and You created him from clay.”
[Allah] said: "Get out from it, for it is not for you, and you are expelled."
He said, "Respite me till the Day of Resurrection."
He said, "You are waiting.
He said, "Because, I have led me astray from my error, and I have followed the Straight Path.

And (We said): "O Adam, dwell in your garden and eat, and eat you in the Garden, and do not approach this tree, and do not be of the wrongdoers."
But Satan whispered to them from their hearts, and he said, "Your Lord is your Lord, so that you may show you a tree, so that you may become angels and become immortals."
And he swore to them: "I am a trustworthy adviser of you."
So he turned away from them. And when they tasted the tree, they tasted the leaves of their Lord. And they tasted the leaves of the Garden, and they called out to themselves: "Did I not forbid you to eat from the tree?" They said, "I did not forbid you from the tree of Satan. Indeed, Satan is a enemy to you."
They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You have lost us, we would not have lost us, and You shall have lost the lost."

He said, "Therein you will live, and you will die, and you will be brought forth to life."

O children of Adam! When messengers come to you from among you, rehearsing to you My revelations and reforms, and no fear shall be on them, nor shall they grieve.
But those who reject Our revelations and are stiff-necked -- they are the fellows of the Fire, and they shall abide therein.
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah, or cries lies to His revelations, or cries to the meeting of Us? They will say, "Where are the messengers?" They will say, "Where are those whom you used to invoke besides Allah?" They will say, "We were lost." They will say, "We have lost themselves."
They will say: "Enter the gates of the Fire!" And We will separate the people before the people before the people, and they will say: "What is the matter of those who were before you?"
