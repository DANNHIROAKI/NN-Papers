Rein is a efficient and robust fine-tuning method, specifically developed to effectively utilize **Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)** for **Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS)**. It achieves **SOTA on Cityscapes to ACDC, and GTAV to Cityscapes+Mapillary+BDD100K**.  Using only synthetic data, Rein achieved an mIoU of **78.4\% on Cityscapes** validation set! Using only the data from the Cityscapes training set, we achieved an average mIoU of **77.6% on ACDC** test set!

## Visualization
Trained on Cityscapes, Rein generalizes to unseen driving scenes and cities: Nighttime Shanghai, Foggy Countryside, and Rainy Hollywood.

## Try and Test
**Experience the demo:** Users can open [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) in any Jupyter-supported editor to explore our demonstration.
![Demo Preview](docs/demo.png)

For testing on the cityscapes dataset, refer to the 'Install' and 'Setup' sections below.
  
## Environment Setup
To set up your environment, execute the following commands:
```bash
conda create -n rein -y
conda activate rein
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.0"
pip install "mmsegmentation>=1.0.0"
pip install "mmdet>=3.0.0"
pip install xformers=='0.0.20' # optional for DINOv2
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install future tensorboard
```

## Dataset Preparation
The Preparation is similar as [DDB](https://github.com/xiaoachen98/DDB).

**Cityscapes:** Download `leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip` and `gt_trainvaltest.zip` from [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/) and extract them to `data/cityscapes`.

**Mapillary:** Download MAPILLARY v1.2 from [Mapillary Research](https://research.mapillary.com/) and extract it to `data/mapillary`.

**GTA:** Download all image and label packages from [TU Darmstadt](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/) and extract them to `data/gta`.

Prepare datasets with these commands:
```shell
cd Rein
mkdir data
# Convert data for validation if preparing for the first time
python tools/convert_datasets/gta.py data/gta # Source domain
python tools/convert_datasets/cityscapes.py data/cityscapes
# Convert Mapillary to Cityscapes format and resize for validation
python tools/convert_datasets/mapillary2cityscape.py data/mapillary data/mapillary/cityscapes_trainIdLabel --train_id
python tools/convert_datasets/mapillary_resize.py data/mapillary/validation/images data/mapillary/cityscapes_trainIdLabel/val/label data/mapillary/half/val_img data/mapillary/half/val_label
```
(Optional) **ACDC**: Download all image and label packages from [ACDC](https://acdc.vision.ee.ethz.ch/) and extract them to `data/acdc`.

(Optional) **UrbanSyn**: Download all image and label packages from [UrbanSyn](http://www.urbansyn.org/#loaded) and extract them to `data/urbansyn`.

The final folder structure should look like this:

## Pretraining Weights
* **Download:** Download pre-trained weights from [facebookresearch](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dinov2/dinov2_vitl14/dinov2_vitl14_pretrain.pth) for testing. Place them in the project directory without changing the file name.
* **Convert:** Convert pre-trained weights for training or evaluation.
  ```bash
  python tools/convert_models/convert_dinov2.py checkpoints/dinov2_vitl14_pretrain.pth checkpoints/dinov2_converted.pth
  ```
  (optional for 1024x1024 resolution)
  ```bash
  python tools/convert_models/convert_dinov2.py checkpoints/dinov2_vitl14_pretrain.pth checkpoints/dinov2_converted_1024x1024.pth --height 1024 --width 1024
  ```
## Evaluation
  Run the evaluation:
  ```
  python tools/test.py configs/dinov2/rein_dinov2_mask2former_512x512_bs1x4.py checkpoints/dinov2_rein_and_head.pth --backbone dinov2_converted.pth
  ```
  For most of provided release checkpoints, you can run this command to evluate
  ```
  python tools/test.py /path/to/cfg /path/to/checkpoint --backbone /path/to/dinov2_converted.pth #(or dinov2_converted_1024x1024.pth)
  ```

## Training
Start training in single GPU:
```
python tools/train.py configs/dinov2/rein_dinov2_mask2former_512x512_bs1x4.py
```
Start training in multiple GPU:
```
PORT=12345 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2,3,4 bash tools/dist_train.sh configs/dinov2/rein_dinov2_mask2former_1024x1024_bs4x2.py NUM_GPUS

* [How to Integrate Rein into Your Existing Backbone?(without mmsegmentation)](docs/easy_rein.md)
* Q: How to Visualize?
  * A: Use `tools/visualize.py`, such as :
  ``` bash
  python tools/visualize.py /path/to/cfg /path/to/checkpoint /path/to/images --backbone /path/to/converted_backbone
  ```
  here `/path/to/images` can be a filename or image folder.

* Q: Why do we need to use multiple weight files during testing?**

  * A: The weight files used during testing are:

    - **Backbone**: Pre-trained backbone weight files. Since Rein is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, there is no need to fine-tune the backbone. This means that for the same backbone, we only need to store one set of parameters, which can significantly reduce storage space.
      
    - **Rein_head**: Fine-tuned Rein weights and decode head weights.
