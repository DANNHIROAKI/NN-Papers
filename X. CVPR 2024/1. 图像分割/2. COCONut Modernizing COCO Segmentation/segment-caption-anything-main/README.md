tl;dr
1. Despite the absence of semantic labels in the training data, SAM implies high-level semantics sufficient for captioning. 
2. SCA (b) is a lightweight augmentation of SAM (a) with the ability to generate regional captions.
3. On top of SAM architecture, we add a fixed pre-trained language mode, and a optimizable lightweight hybrid feature mixture whose training is cheap and scalable.
