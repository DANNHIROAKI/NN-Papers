# i-Code Studio: A Configurable and Composable Framework for Integrative AI

## Introduction
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires comprehensive understanding and generation
capabilities for a variety of tasks spanning different modalities and functionalities.
Integrative AI is one important direction to approach AGI, through combining multiple models to
tackle complex multimodal tasks. However, there is a lack of a flexible and composable platform to facilitate efficient
and effective model composition and coordination.

In this paper, we propose the i-Code Studio, a configurable and
composable framework for Integrative AI. The i-Code Studio orchestrates multiple pre-trained models in a finetuning-free fashion
to conduct complex multimodal tasks. Instead of simple model composition, the i-Code Studio provides an integrative, flexible, and
composable setting for developers to quickly and easily compose cutting-edge services and technologies tailored to their specific requirements. 
The i-Code Studio achieves impressive results on a variety of zero-shot multimodal tasks, such as video-to-text retrieval, speech-to-speech translation, and
visual question answering. We also demonstrate how to quickly build a multimodal agent based on the i-Code Studio that can communicate and personalize for users.
