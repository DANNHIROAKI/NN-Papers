# MEDA: Manifold Embedded Distribution Alignment

This directory contains the code for paper [Visual Domain Adaptation with Manifold Embedded Distribution Alignment](http://jd92.wang/assets/files/a11_mm18.pdf) published at ACM Multimedia conference (ACM MM) 2018 as an Oral presentation. This paper is also lucky to be ranked as **Top 10 papers**.

## Usage

The original code is written using Matlab R2017a. I think all versions after 2015 can run the code.

For Python users, I add a `MEDA.py` implementation. The Python version will need to import GFK module (can be found [here](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/traditional/GFK)). However, this Python version is only for reference since the graph Laplacian (as exactly in Matlab) is not implemented.

**For deep version (DeepMEDA), see [here](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/deep/DeepMEDA)!**

## Demo

I offer a basic demo to run on the Office+Caltech10 + surf datasets. Download the datasets [here](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DYROSb8QjKnsBRjxwJUE) (access code: j5qnvr) and put the data (mat files) into the `data` folder.

Run `demo_office_caltech_surf.m`.

## Results

MEDA achieved **state-of-the-art** performances compared to a lot of traditional and deep methods as of 2018. The testing datasets are most popular domain adaptation and transfer learning datasets: Office+Caltech10, Office-31, USPS+MNIST, ImageNet+VOC2007.

The following results are from the original paper and its [supplementary file](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DRuWOFkQjKnsBRjkr2E).

## Office-31 dataset 

Using ResNet-50 features (compare with the latest deep methods with ResNet-50 as backbone). It seems **MEDA** is the only traditional method that can challenge these heavy deep adversarial methods.
