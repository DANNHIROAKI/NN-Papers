# Traditional transfer learning

Here we implement several popular traditional transfer learning methods.

Most of the datasets are based on Office-Caltech10 Surf features, which can be downloaded here: https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DaKoCGIQmN7PCBju9KsD, with password `PRSZD9`.

We also provide a notebook for you to directly run two algorithms using **Jupyter notebook**.

You can easily download the notebook from [here](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/notebooks/traditional_transfer_learning.ipynb).

We also put it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w4WkCrZeCKaornJo66P4hxC7kzm4l70U?usp=sharing).

Try and experiment on them!
