Long Short Term Memory Units
============================
This is self-contained package to train a language model on word level Penn Tree Bank dataset. 
It achieves 115 perplexity for a small model in 1h, and 81 perplexity for a big model in 
a day. Model ensemble of 38 big models gives 69 perplexity.
This code is derived from https://github.com/wojciechz/learning_to_execute (the same author, but 
a different company).
