Tutorial 3: Embeddings
======================

This tutorial shows you how to use Flair to produce embeddings for words and documents.
Embeddings are vector representations that are useful for a variety of reasons.
All Flair models are trained on top of embeddings, so if you want to train your own models,
you should understand how embeddings work.
